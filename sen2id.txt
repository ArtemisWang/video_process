i miss rachel.:::['6-9-3']
no, my parents.:::['6-9-4']
oh, great, they haven't seen the place since i moved in.:::['6-9-5']
yeah, and if you could not mention that we live together, that'd be great.:::['6-9-6']
i was thinking we'd eat around 4.:::['6-9-7']
why can't i tell them we live together?:::['6-9-8']
they don't know we're dating. should we eat in the kitchen?:::['6-9-9']
why haven't you told them?:::['6-9-10']
um, well, i was going to. i really was.:::['6-9-11']
but, um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, i didn't.:::['6-9-12']
why haven't you told them? wouldn't they be happy?:::['6-9-13']
so, dinner in the kitchen around 4. i'll see you then.:::['6-9-14']
why wouldn't they be happy?:::['6-9-15']
well, um, because......mainly, um......they don't like you.:::['6-9-16']
i'm sorry. what? why? why?:::['6-9-17']
maybe because you used to be aloof......or that you're really sarcastic:::['6-9-18']
or that you joke around all the time......or that you take off your clothes:::['6-9-19']
and throw them on the couch.:::['6-9-20']
is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?:::['6-9-21']
i know i should have told them. i know i shouldn't care what they think.:::['6-9-22']
i'm sorry.:::['6-9-23', '6-23-253', '1-17-310', '1-1-80', '1-3-270', '1-5-338', '1-13-240', '8-1-204', '9-23-84', '9-23-568', '9-21-360', '9-6-185', '9-6-401', '9-9-273', '9-10-41', '7-20-300', '7-9-283', '7-5-313', '7-11-70', '10-17-536', '2-10-277', '2-19-101', '2-19-125', '2-22-168', '2-21-276', '5-19-296', '5-21-264', '5-8-316', '5-9-193', '5-9-258', '5-1-120', '5-1-290', '5-16-52', '4-14-196', '4-7-153', '4-4-11', '4-4-189', '4-2-289', '3-8-130', '3-8-313', '3-19-243', '3-21-314', '3-20-327', '3-13-224', '3-6-271', '3-16-162']

you think that'll work?:::['6-9-26']
hey, i can be pretty charming, babe. i won you over, didn't i?:::['6-9-27']

monica told me they don't.:::['6-9-31']
yeah, they don't like you.:::['6-9-32']
do you know why?:::['6-9-33', '7-6-153']
maybe it's because you're really sarcastic, or maybe it's because you...:::['6-9-34']
if people don't know, they shouldn't just guess.:::['6-9-35']
great. another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.:::['6-9-36']
maybe i give thanks for you shutting up, huh?:::['6-9-37']

monica, all this food looks wonderful.:::['6-9-101']
you should think about doing this for a living.:::['6-9-102']
okay, i have dandruff. there's no need to laugh and point.:::['6-9-103']
dad, chandler was laughing at your joke.:::['6-9-104']
my joke wasn't funny.:::['6-9-105']
rach, i just remembered.:::['6-9-106']
i had a dream about mr. geller last night.:::['6-9-107']
really?:::['6-9-108', '6-9-240', '6-9-249', '6-8-110', '6-15-70', '6-11-255', '6-10-282', '6-13-269', '6-22-237', '6-22-318', '6-21-321', '6-18-192', '6-18-332', '6-7-328', '6-2-139', '6-2-322', '6-1-23', '1-22-193', '1-23-304', '1-20-222', '1-20-319', '1-17-27', '1-17-330', '1-4-297', '1-4-309', '8-3-56', '8-10-241', '8-14-255', '8-24-197', '8-21-268', '8-23-278', '8-8-110', '9-23-415', '9-20-310', '9-2-10', '9-6-272', '9-4-328', '9-14-190', '7-20-206', '7-22-245', '7-22-254', '7-18-49', '7-8-106', '7-6-45', '7-5-59', '7-4-70', '7-4-275', '7-16-173', '7-17-138', '7-17-288', '7-13-204', '7-12-274', '10-3-82', '10-12-308', '10-9-308', '2-8-195', '2-11-131', '2-16-205', '2-16-240', '2-16-330', '2-17-307', '2-15-188', '2-1-249', '2-23-64', '5-24-76', '5-23-111', '5-23-230', '5-20-281', '5-21-130', '5-9-80', '5-4-96', '5-11-209', '5-14-200', '5-14-231', '4-13-59', '4-13-316', '4-10-109', '4-14-293', '4-7-68', '4-7-110', '4-5-192', '3-8-276', '3-21-162', '3-23-334', '3-2-14', '3-11-184', '3-1-323', '3-10-41', '3-4-331']
yeah. i dreamt that he saved me from a burning building......and he was so brave and so strong.:::['6-9-109']
and it's making me look at him totally differently.:::['6-9-110']
you know, i mean, he used to be just "jack geller, monica and ross' dad.":::['6-9-111']
now he's "jack geller, dream hunk.":::['6-9-112']
i don't know. to me, he'll always be "jack geller......walks in while you're changing.":::['6-9-113']
you know, dad, chandler is one of ross' very best friends.:::['6-9-114']
ross sure is a great guy.:::['6-9-115']
you know, i've always felt that how a young man turns out......is a reflection on his father.:::['6-9-116']
i always thought that too. tell me, what does your father do?:::['6-9-117']
he's a headliner of a......gay burlesque show.:::['6-9-118']
rach, you're killing us. will you serve the dessert already?:::['6-9-119']
there's drunken dancers a-waiting.:::['6-9-120']
look at it. isn't it beautiful?:::['6-9-121']
yeah. what is it?:::['6-9-122']
it's a trifle. it's got all these layers.:::['6-9-123']
first there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam......then custard,which i made from scratch......then raspberries,more ladyfingers......then beef sautéed:::['6-9-124']
with peas and onions......then a little bit more custard......then bananas and then:::['6-9-125']
i put whipped cream on top.:::['6-9-126']
what was the one right before bananas?:::['6-9-127']
the beef. yeah, that was weird to me too.:::['6-9-128']
but then i thought, "well, there's minced meat pie.":::['6-9-129']
that's an english dessert.:::['6-9-130']
these people just put very strange things in their food.:::['6-9-131']
by the way, can i borrow rum from your place?:::['6-9-132']
yeah, sure.:::['6-9-133', '8-4-227', '8-16-112', '8-16-213', '7-5-215', '2-21-233', '5-13-193']

we're never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world.:::['6-9-144']
no, no, we will. we just won't tell her she messed up.:::['6-9-145']
just let her serve the beef-custard thing?:::['6-9-146']
yeah. it'll be like a funny thanksgiving story.:::['6-9-147']
vomiting stories are funny, i guess.:::['6-9-148']
joey. god, your apartment is like a hundred degrees.:::['6-9-149']

i don't mean tight. it's not too tight. not that i was looking at...:::['6-9-159']
what's the matter with him?:::['6-9-160']

dude, i need to talk to you a sec.:::['6-9-163']
okay, i think i might know why my parents don't like you.:::['6-9-164']
you do? why? okay, remember we were young. heh.:::['6-9-165']
spring break, sophomore year, i got high in my bedroom......and my parents walked in:::['6-9-166']
and smelled it......so i told them that you had gotten stoned:::['6-9-167']
and jumped out the window.:::['6-9-168']
what? why did you do that?:::['6-9-169']
i don't know. uh, yours was the first name that popped into my head.:::['6-9-170']
i'm sorry. i didn't think it'd matter.:::['6-9-171']
how could it not matter?:::['6-9-172']
how was i to know we'd be friends after college......let alone:::['6-9-173']
you'd be living with my sister?:::['6-9-174']
what about all that "friends forever" stuff?:::['6-9-175']
i don't know. i was all high.:::['6-9-176']
mom and dad just sent me to find out if you were trying to get ross stoned.:::['6-9-177']
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college, and he blamed it on me.:::['6-9-178']
ross, i can't believe you'd do that.:::['6-9-179']
we haven't told them we're together because they hate me, okay? so fix this.:::['6-9-180']
okay, okay, i'll tell them it wasn't chandler who got high.:::['6-9-181']
now, who should i say it was?:::['6-9-182']
you. it's not like it's a big deal. you don't still do it or anything.:::['6-9-183']
all right. now, who should i say tricked me into doing it?:::['6-9-184']
dad.:::['6-9-185']
dad, please don't pick your teeth out here.:::['6-9-186']
and if you're gonna put your feet up... monica, leave him alone.:::['6-9-187']
will you hurry up?:::['6-9-188']
did you not hear me when i told you that all of janine's friends are dancers?:::['6-9-189']
huh? and that they're gonna be drinking a lot?:::['6-9-190']
no, i did. but tell me again because it's so romantic.:::['6-9-191']
you're whipping so slow. can't you do it any faster?:::['6-9-192']
joey, come on, i don't want to make any mistakes.:::['6-9-193']
this is the only dessert. if i screw it up, everybody's gonna be like::::['6-9-194']
"oh, remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle?":::['6-9-195']
so just let me worry about making it, and you just worry about eating it.:::['6-9-196']
oh, i am.:::['6-9-197']
ross, if you don't tell them, then i will. okay. fine.:::['6-9-198']
ross, can i talk to you for a second? oh, uh...:::['6-9-199']
can it wait a second, joey? i have to tell my parents something.:::['6-9-200']
no, it can't? okay.:::['6-9-201']
okay, look, i think we have to tell rachel she messed up her dessert.:::['6-9-202']
what? what is with everybody?:::['6-9-203']
it's thanksgiving, not......truth day.:::['6-9-204']
look, when everyone eats that banana-meat thing......they'll all make fun of her.:::['6-9-205']
do you want that?:::['6-9-206']
okay. we'll just get everyone to act like they like it.:::['6-9-207']
that way, no one makes fun of her......and we still get to go:::['6-9-208']

i thought this might happen today.:::['6-9-224']
ross, i know the holidays can be rough......and it's probably really hard:::['6-9-225']
for you to be alone right now.:::['6-9-226']
you're alone.:::['6-9-227']
no, i live with phoebe.:::['6-9-228']
i mean, you're alone-alone.:::['6-9-229']
and it's just not the time for us. i'm sorry.:::['6-9-230']
oh, well. can't blame a guy for trying.:::['6-9-231']
and, uh, if anyone needs help pretending to like it......i learned some things in acting class.:::['6-9-232']
try, uh, rubbing your stomach.:::['6-9-233']
or, uh, saying "mm.":::['6-9-234']
and, uh, oh, smiling.:::['6-9-235']
okay?:::['6-9-236', '6-25-143', '7-7-212', '5-20-244', '5-20-305', '5-4-69', '5-4-165', '3-1-211']
yeah, i'm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.:::['6-9-237']
rachel, there you are. let's serve that dessert already.:::['6-9-238']
joey, you have to stop rushing me. you know what? you don't get any dessert.:::['6-9-239']
no, just kidding. i would never do that to you.:::['6-9-241']
okay, everybody, it's trifle time.:::['6-9-242']
so, now, rach, this is a traditional english trifle, isn't it?:::['6-9-243']
it sure is. phoebe: wow.:::['6-9-244']
so did you make it with beef or eggplant?:::['6-9-245']
beef. i can't have any. i don't eat meat. oh.:::['6-9-246']
all: aw.:::['6-9-247', '6-13-29', '1-9-292', '8-18-147', '2-10-343', '2-11-285', '3-11-30', '3-16-247']
monica, i want you to have the first taste.:::['6-9-248']
wait, you only got whipped cream.:::['6-9-250']
you gotta take a bite with all the layers.:::['6-9-251']
you dropped a pea.:::['6-9-253']
well?:::['6-9-254', '2-16-327']
mm.:::['6-9-255', '6-8-261', '6-15-328', '6-1-27', '1-2-111', '8-12-96', '8-12-130', '8-16-120', '9-23-293', '9-6-420', '7-22-231', '7-15-149', '7-10-26', '10-1-271', '10-9-273', '2-8-95', '2-8-179', '2-10-64', '2-13-135', '2-19-262', '2-6-310', '5-18-264', '5-12-317', '4-13-113', '4-18-126', '3-19-240', '3-3-97', '3-1-85']
it's good.:::['6-9-256']
really? how good?:::['6-9-257']
it's so good that i feel really selfish......about being the only one:::['6-9-258']
who's eating it.:::['6-9-259']
i think we should have everyone taste how good it is.:::['6-9-260']
especially ross.:::['6-9-261', '9-1-86']
chandler: mm-hm.:::['6-9-262', '10-11-297', '2-10-205', '4-24-161']
all: mm.:::['6-9-263']
yeah. this is so good that i'm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony.:::['6-9-264']
so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert.:::['6-9-265']
i've gotta call my friend......and tell her how good:::['6-9-266']
this is from monica's room.:::['6-9-267']
i'll help you dial.:::['6-9-268']
i'm gonna go into the bathroom......so i can look at it:::['6-9-269']
in the mirror as i eat it.:::['6-9-270']
okay, what was that all about? does it not taste good?:::['6-9-271']
let me try it. no, no.:::['6-9-272']
all gone.:::['6-9-273']
so good.:::['6-9-274']
maybe chandler has some left.:::['6-9-275']
it tastes like feet.:::['6-9-276', '8-19-137']
i like it.:::['6-9-277', '8-19-138', '10-14-39', '2-1-272', '4-5-291']
are you kidding?:::['6-9-278', '6-12-272', '9-6-90', '10-16-61', '5-18-48', '5-16-72']
what's not to like? custard, good.:::['6-9-279']
jam, good. meat, good.:::['6-9-280', '8-19-140']
so a bird just grabbed it......and then tried:::['6-9-281']
to fly away with it......and then just dropped it:::['6-9-282']
on the street?:::['6-9-283']
yes, but, if it's any consolation, before the bird dropped it......he seemed to enjoy it.:::['6-9-284']
rachel, come here.:::['6-9-285', '6-2-131']
i was just taking my thanksgiving nap and i had another dream about jack.:::['6-9-287']
phoebe, do i want to hear this? i don't know, let's see.:::['6-9-288']
okay, i dreamt we were getting married......and he left because:::['6-9-289']
he had to go fight a fire.:::['6-9-290']
and, um, so, okay, i went to a nightclub and i saw him making out with a girl.:::['6-9-291']
oh, my god, he dream-cheated on you.:::['6-9-292']
yeah. but then jacques cousteau came......and he kicked his ass:::['6-9-293']
for betraying me.:::['6-9-294']
it was so cool.:::['6-9-295']
then he took me diving and introduced me to his pet sea horse......who was coming on to me.:::['6-9-296']
and, please, that is not gonna happen.:::['6-9-297']
boy, i'm glad i wore the big belt today.:::['6-9-298']
five minutes ago, a line like that would have floored me.:::['6-9-299']
but now, nothing. well, not nothing. i am still a woman.:::['6-9-300']
ross? let's go.:::['6-9-301']
oh, yeah. about telling mom and dad......i was thinking about:::['6-9-302']
maybe writing a letter.:::['6-9-303']
you know what? that's it. you've had your chance.:::['6-9-304']
mom, dad. ross smoked pot in college.:::['6-9-305']
you are such a tattletale.:::['6-9-307']
mom, dad, heh......you remember that time:::['6-9-308']
you walked in my room......and smelled marijuana?:::['6-9-309']
yes. yes.:::['6-9-310']
i told you it was chandler......who was smoking the pot but......it was me. i'm sorry.:::['6-9-311']
it was you?:::['6-9-312']
and, dad, you know that mailman that you got fired?:::['6-9-313']
he didn't steal your playboys. ross did.:::['6-9-314']
well, hurricane gloria didn't break the porch swing. monica did.:::['6-9-315']
ross hasn't worked at the museum for a year.:::['6-9-316']
monica and chandler are living together!:::['6-9-317']
ross married rachel in vegas. and got divorced. again!:::['6-9-318']
i love jacques cousteau.:::['6-9-319']
i wasn't supposed to put beef in the trifle.:::['6-9-320']
i want to go!:::['6-9-321']
that's a lot of information to get in 30 seconds.:::['6-9-322']
all right. joey, if you want to leave, just leave.:::['6-9-323']
rachel, no, you weren't supposed to put beef in the trifle.:::['6-9-324']
it did not taste good.:::['6-9-325']
phoebe, i'm sorry......but i think jacques cousteau is dead.:::['6-9-326']
monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact......that you're in an important:::['6-9-327']
relationship is beyond me.:::['6-9-328']
and we kind of figured about the porch swing.:::['6-9-329']
ross.:::['6-9-330', '6-22-285', '6-22-301', '6-5-5', '1-22-308', '1-16-91', '1-16-268', '1-2-194', '9-13-371', '7-12-73', '2-11-287', '5-18-271', '5-20-225', '5-21-363', '5-4-27', '5-16-79', '5-16-91', '4-15-188', '3-19-99', '3-12-228']
drugs?:::['6-9-331']
divorced again?:::['6-9-332']
what happened, son?:::['6-9-333']
i... i, uh... i got tricked into all those things.:::['6-9-334']
chandler, you've been ross' best friend all these years......stuck by him:::['6-9-335']
during the drug problems......and now you've taken on:::['6-9-336']
monica as well.:::['6-9-337']
well, i don't know what to say.:::['6-9-338']

you gotta be careful. this girl thing is dangerous. it's spreading.:::['6-8-10']
it is?:::['6-8-11', '6-2-321']
is this your pretty pink pillow on the couch?:::['6-8-12']
is that your tiny little box that's too small to put anything in?:::['6-8-14']
no. no.:::['6-8-15', '6-23-182', '1-21-128', '1-11-291', '8-15-194', '9-18-284', '7-4-193', '2-14-186', '5-19-91', '5-23-299', '5-14-271', '3-10-180', '3-10-313']

is this hillary, your hot assistant chef, hillary?:::['6-8-27']
yeah. the one that stares at me?:::['6-8-28']
no. the one who looked at you once because you got in her way.:::['6-8-29']

why don't you set us up?:::['6-8-31']
ooh, are you setting ross up with someone?:::['6-8-32']

phoebe: hey. rachel: hey.:::['6-8-34']
rachel, i'm making up flyers to try to get new massage clients.:::['6-8-35']
so can i come to bloomingdale's and use the copy machine?:::['6-8-36']
well, sure, but they might think it's weird considering i don't work there anymore.:::['6-8-37']
oh, my god. what happened?:::['6-8-38', '2-12-88', '4-2-254']
i got a job at ralph lauren.:::['6-8-39']
well, that's great. congratulations.:::['6-8-40']
a year ago.:::['6-8-41']
you've lasted all year. good for you.:::['6-8-42']
but, pheebs, you could still use the copy machine where i actually work.:::['6-8-43']
but come by at lunch so my boss doesn't see you.:::['6-8-44']
kim will freak out. she already doesn't like me.:::['6-8-45']
i don't think my boss likes me. i don't think mine likes me either.:::['6-8-46']
maybe it's a universal thing.:::['6-8-47']
or maybe because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a wednesday.:::['6-8-48']
chandler: yeah, let's head off to work.:::['6-8-49']
phoebe: thank you. rachel: sure.:::['6-8-50']

here. ooh.:::['6-8-138']
who's the silver fox?:::['6-8-139']
that is your make-out buddy. don't you recognize him?:::['6-8-140']
oh, wait. "ooh, phoebe, i love you. kiss me, please.":::['6-8-141']
that's not ralph lauren. it sounds like him, though.:::['6-8-142']
yeah, no, ralph doesn't look like that guy.:::['6-8-144']
he's young, and he's got long hair and a beard and a hacky sack...:::['6-8-145']
oh, my god. that's not ralph lauren. that's kenny the copy guy.:::['6-8-146']
oh, god... i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren.:::['6-8-148']
if she finds out that i lied to her, she is gonna hate me even more. phoebe!:::['6-8-149']
why would the copy guy say he's ralph lauren?:::['6-8-150']
to get you to make out with him.:::['6-8-151']
okay, maybe this will make them look less white.:::['6-8-153']
nope. heh.:::['6-8-154']
okay, so colors that don't work are......blue, yellow, green, red, black,white, orange and purple.:::['6-8-155']
i don't know what i'm gonna do. the date starts in an hour.:::['6-8-156']
ross, maybe if your skin was lighter, your teeth wouldn't look so bright.:::['6-8-157']
oh, great. so all i need to do is get some new skin. thank you.:::['6-8-158']
if we put just a little bit of makeup on you...:::['6-8-159']
whoa, whoa.:::['6-8-160', '1-19-91', '2-10-244', '2-7-8', '3-9-220']
we're not 13 anymore.:::['6-8-161']
ross, this is the only thing left that has a shot at working.:::['6-8-162']
won't she notice i have makeup on?:::['6-8-163']
half the guys out there have makeup on.:::['6-8-164']
half the people... i mean... just try it and see.:::['6-8-166']
no, i am not putting on makeup.:::['6-8-167']
hello? ross, could you put up some of these flyers for me?:::['6-8-168']
no! demon! demon!:::['6-8-169']
now our drawers will smell nice, and we didn't waste these pantyhose.:::['6-8-170']
god forbid we throw out old underwear.:::['6-8-171']
you know what? i'm gonna go over to joey's.:::['6-8-172']
we're supposed to organize the wrapping paper.:::['6-8-173']
yes, but i've really gotten in touch with my feminine side enough today.:::['6-8-174']
in fact, we're two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple.:::['6-8-175']
this has been kind of a girlie day. you're right. i'm sorry.:::['6-8-176']
it's okay. i just feel like i need to be in a guy place......do kind of a man thing.:::['6-8-177']
go over to joey's and......drink some beer and:::['6-8-178']
hammer up some dry wall.:::['6-8-179']
when guys hang out, they don't just drink beer and hammer up dry wall.:::['6-8-180']
when girls hang out, we don't have pillow fights in our underwear.:::['6-8-181']
i'm sorry. we do. we do.:::['6-8-182']
i don't know why i said that.:::['6-8-183']
hey, chandler.:::['6-8-184', '9-22-356', '5-9-238']
come on in. we're knitting potholders.:::['6-8-185']
no, thanks, josephine.:::['6-8-186']
ross, i was wondering if...:::['6-8-187']
oh, my god. where are all the men?:::['6-8-188']
oh. hi, kim. hi, rachel.:::['6-8-189']
uh, remember that thing that happened yesterday? well, it didn't happen.:::['6-8-190']
you didn't cancel the fabric order from taiwan?:::['6-8-191']
okay, two things didn't happen.:::['6-8-192']
remember i told you someone made out with ralph lauren?:::['6-8-193']
well, it turns out that's not true.:::['6-8-194']
it's not true? oh, that's interesting.:::['6-8-195']
because i checked. only one keycard was used to access the copy machine......yesterday during lunch,and that keycard belonged to you, rachel.:::['6-8-196']
oh, no. no, no, no. oh, god, you think i made out with him?:::['6-8-197']
listen to me, if you think sleeping with ralph is gonna get you my job......you are sadly mistaken.:::['6-8-198']
oh, no. i don't want your job. i don't.:::['6-8-199']
oh, this is such a mistake. i didn't make out with him.:::['6-8-200']
nobody made out with him. i did not use my keycard yesterday.:::['6-8-201']
i don't even know how to use my keycard.:::['6-8-202']
kim: hi, ralph. hi, kim.:::['6-8-203', '6-8-291']
yeah. nothing happened.:::['6-8-204']
you could cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.:::['6-8-205']
after that, what could i do except become a chef?:::['6-8-206']
ross: mm-hm.:::['6-8-207', '1-1-326', '10-11-17', '4-21-140']
and someday soon, i hope to open my own restaurant.:::['6-8-208']
ross: mm.:::['6-8-209', '1-9-314', '10-10-313', '3-13-68']
you know, you're a really great listener.:::['6-8-210']
most guys i go out with, they just talk and talk.:::['6-8-211']
after a while, it's like, "shut your mouth." you know?:::['6-8-212']
i've probably been talking too much. why don't we talk about you?:::['6-8-213']
come on, i want to know.:::['6-8-214']
okay. i'm from long island.:::['6-8-215']
i came to the city for college.:::['6-8-216']
um, i, uh, have a 5-year-old son, and in my spare time......i like to read spy novels.:::['6-8-217']
but let's talk more about you. hmm?:::['6-8-218']
so if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan......your arrangement will:::['6-8-219']
look fresh much longer.:::['6-8-220']
joey, that is such a great tip.:::['6-8-221']
monica, can you excuse us? i need to talk to the girl with the flowers.:::['6-8-222']
okay, but, joey, come over later.:::['6-8-223']
i'm gonna teach you how to make a bird feeder......out of just a pine cone:::['6-8-224']
and some peanut butter.:::['6-8-225']
aw. i love birds.:::['6-8-226']
what is the matter with you?:::['6-8-227', '6-15-2', '9-2-151', '4-10-264']
what? you're arranging flowers.:::['6-8-228']
you got dead flowers.:::['6-8-229']
you've got a picture of a baby dressed like flowers.:::['6-8-230']
this is not joey.:::['6-8-231']
hey, hey, look, i am still joey, okay?:::['6-8-232']
flowers, they're just, you know, nice to look at.:::['6-8-233']
and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist of a famous baby.:::['6-8-234']
you're turning into a woman.:::['6-8-235', '8-19-258']
no, i'm not.:::['6-8-236', '6-25-200', '1-3-282', '7-12-20', '4-4-209']
why would you say that? that's just mean.:::['6-8-237']
now i've upset you? what did i say?:::['6-8-238', '8-19-260']
it's not what you said. it's the way you said it.:::['6-8-239']
i'm a woman.:::['6-8-241']
so now she thinks that i made out with him and that i did it to get her job.:::['6-8-242']
why didn't you just tell the truth? i did.:::['6-8-243']
she doesn't think anyone would confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren.:::['6-8-244']
well, what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company?:::['6-8-245']
what if kenny hired that ralph guy to be the pretty front man, huh?:::['6-8-246']
did she ever think of that?:::['6-8-247']
you were with kenny today, weren't you?:::['6-8-248']
just for a second. ugh.:::['6-8-249']
phoebe, what am i gonna do? well...:::['6-8-250']
the only thing you can do. sleep with ralph lauren.:::['6-8-251']
i'm not gonna sleep with ralph lauren. i mean, i could, but i wouldn't.:::['6-8-252']
ooh. sleep with kenny.:::['6-8-253']
that wouldn't help me. oh, yes, it would.:::['6-8-254']
i've had a really good time tonight. mm-hm.:::['6-8-255']
you know, i rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.:::['6-8-256']
me neither.:::['6-8-257', '6-10-289', '6-12-72', '1-2-189', '9-23-312', '9-16-302', '5-5-194']
uh, i've had a really good time too, you know.:::['6-8-258']
are you gonna eat that bread?:::['6-8-259']
oh, i just like the smell.:::['6-8-260']
you make me laugh.:::['6-8-262']
would you like to move over to the couch?:::['6-8-263']
mm-hm.:::['6-8-264', '6-5-290', '6-3-287', '6-2-223', '1-21-150', '1-2-311', '8-1-141', '9-22-92', '9-7-141', '9-15-72', '7-20-190', '7-22-147', '10-6-152', '10-3-282', '10-13-224', '10-13-298', '10-9-274', '2-11-20', '2-22-219', '5-22-316', '5-5-90', '5-7-154', '3-13-249']
maybe i'll just turn down the lights a little?:::['6-8-265']
how about all the way?:::['6-8-266']
ross: wow, cool poster.:::['6-8-268']
or should i say, "groovy poster"?:::['6-8-269']
so, uh......where were we?:::['6-8-270']
are those your teeth?:::['6-8-271']
you can see them, huh?:::['6-8-273']
yes. they're insanely white.:::['6-8-274']
i did that for you.:::['6-8-275']
what's the matter with you?:::['6-8-276', '2-1-267', '5-5-135']
what's the matter with me? you've got a black light. it's 1999.:::['6-8-277']
oh, good. kim, hi.:::['6-8-278']
hi, rachel. oh. i wanted to ask you, have you seen the new ralph lauren sheets?:::['6-8-279']
what am i thinking? of course you have.:::['6-8-280']
okay, look.:::['6-8-281', '7-23-212', '5-16-165']
i'm sorry that i lied to you before.:::['6-8-282']
you were right. ralph and i were an item, but we're not anymore.:::['6-8-283']
oh, really?:::['6-8-284', '6-22-228', '6-20-112', '1-9-281', '5-9-197']
yeah, he dumped me.:::['6-8-285']
he said, "rachel, i can't do this.:::['6-8-286']
even though you're a very, very......very beautiful woman......i can't do this.:::['6-8-287']
i'm married and i'm sorry.":::['6-8-288']
and i don't know why, but he said, "and you will never get promoted......especially not above kim,who is an integral cog......in the ralph lauren machine.":::['6-8-289']
you expect me to believe...:::['6-8-290']
he just gave you the coldest look i've ever seen. it's like he hates you.:::['6-8-293']
then it is true.:::['6-8-294']
of course it's true. and it hurts so bad.:::['6-8-295']
oh, honey, come here.:::['6-8-296']
oh, it'll be okay.:::['6-8-297']
we've all been there.:::['6-8-298']
you and ralph?:::['6-8-299']
kenny the copy boy.:::['6-8-300']
uh, i need to talk to you. what's the matter? you upset?:::['6-8-302']
i'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of all this girlie stuff in here.:::['6-8-303']
i, uh... i gotta be a man.:::['6-8-304']
okay? the living room has to remain a guy place, okay?:::['6-8-305']
that's just the way it has to be.:::['6-8-306']
if that's what you want, i'll just put it all in my room.:::['6-8-307']
good. great.:::['6-8-308']
and, uh, thanks for being so understanding.:::['6-8-309']
i didn't want to make a big deal out of this.:::['6-8-310']
but you could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room.:::['6-8-311']
i mean, if you want to.:::['6-8-312']
and, uh, maybe the watering can there.:::['6-8-314']
sure.:::['6-8-315', '6-12-49', '6-5-124', '6-7-272', '6-2-220', '6-1-68', '1-5-73', '1-13-73', '8-3-162', '9-1-213', '9-3-257', '9-2-228', '9-4-111', '9-13-266', '9-12-87', '7-23-275', '7-13-278', '10-13-222', '10-15-153', '2-10-327', '2-17-326', '2-2-279', '2-4-222', '2-20-236', '5-7-230', '5-3-211', '5-14-258', '4-10-258', '4-6-119', '3-21-220', '3-3-325', '3-13-188']
and a couple of these little tiny boxes.:::['6-8-316']
joey, do you want me to put it all in your room?:::['6-8-317']
hey, remember when i had a monkey?:::['6-17-0']
yeah. phoebe: mm-hm.:::['6-17-1']
yeah. what was i thinking?:::['6-17-2']
hey, so, what's with the 20 percent tip? did i do something wrong?:::['6-17-3']
twenty percent is a pretty generous tip.:::['6-17-4']
you know what's more generous than that? fifty percent.:::['6-17-5']
you know what's even more generous? i see where you're going.:::['6-17-6']
what's up with the greed, joe? all right, look, i'm sorry, you guys.:::['6-17-7']
it's just that i gotta get these new headshots made......and they're really expensive, you know.:::['6-17-8']
i'm down to like three.:::['6-17-9']
actually, two, because one of them i kind of blackened in some teeth.:::['6-17-10']
why'd i do that? ugh.:::['6-17-11']
well, isn't there something you can do to earn a little extra money?:::['6-17-12']
i mean, can't you pick up, i don't know, an extra shift here?:::['6-17-13']
or, you know, i used to beg for money.:::['6-17-14']
of course, it helps if you've got, you know, a little of this going on.:::['6-17-15']
wow, i still have it. ha, ha. joey: yeah.:::['6-17-16']
wait, don't you have an audition today? yeah. maybe you'll get that job.:::['6-17-17']
oh, ha-ha-ha.:::['6-17-18']
oh, wait a minute.:::['6-17-19']
i used to get medical experiments done on me all the time.:::['6-17-20']
ah, finally, an explanation.:::['6-17-21']
no, i used to get paid for all kinds of medical stuff, remember?:::['6-17-22']
let's see. uh... well, i don't wanna donate sperm again.:::['6-17-23']
i really prefer doing that at the home office, you know?:::['6-17-24']
ooh, ooh, maybe they want some of my blood or spit or something, huh?:::['6-17-25']
joey. yeah?:::['6-17-26']
what did i tell you about talking to your friends while you're working?:::['6-17-27']
uh, do it?:::['6-17-28']
that guy's been waiting for his coffee for 10 minutes.:::['6-17-29']
he's complained about you three times.:::['6-17-30']
now, where was i?:::['6-17-31']
hey, what have you been up to? oh. we went to a self-defense class today.:::['6-17-33']
wow.:::['6-17-34', '6-17-189', '6-16-35', '6-16-114', '6-16-169', '6-14-311', '6-15-55', '6-15-269', '6-20-307', '6-18-230', '6-18-330', '6-25-174', '6-2-62', '1-22-161', '1-23-27', '1-21-181', '1-20-68', '1-24-293', '1-3-307', '1-2-263', '1-7-207', '1-10-259', '1-13-305', '8-3-236', '8-16-241', '8-18-188', '8-18-249', '8-19-210', '8-9-249', '9-1-32', '9-1-104', '9-5-187', '7-9-204', '7-6-207', '7-7-233', '7-4-255', '7-15-186', '7-13-35', '10-3-19', '10-13-119', '10-13-161', '10-11-373', '10-9-138', '10-17-539', '10-17-585', '2-8-104', '2-9-189', '2-13-70', '2-12-2', '2-12-156', '2-15-284', '2-18-209', '2-24-5', '2-24-74', '2-24-337', '2-20-51', '2-5-240', '5-19-236', '5-20-298', '5-7-36', '5-16-255', '5-17-33', '5-17-60', '4-9-291', '4-18-118', '4-20-184', '4-2-215', '4-3-291', '3-22-166', '3-23-196', '3-23-237', '3-23-291', '3-13-156', '3-13-319', '3-11-125', '3-5-270', '3-7-255']
yeah. kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of you.:::['6-17-35']
takes it out of you? heh.:::['6-17-36']
no, now we can kick anybody's ass. yeah.:::['6-17-37']
after one class? i don't think so.:::['6-17-38']
what, you wanna see me self-defend myself?:::['6-17-39']
go over there and pretend you're a sexual predator.:::['6-17-40']
go on, i dare you.:::['6-17-41']
of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming.:::['6-17-42']
that's not enough.:::['6-17-43']
look, i studied karate for a long time.:::['6-17-44']
and there's a concept you should really be familiar with.:::['6-17-45']
it's what the japanese call unagi.:::['6-17-46']
isn't that a kind of sushi?:::['6-17-47']
no, it's a concept. yeah, it is, it is. it's freshwater eel.:::['6-17-48']
all right, maybe it means that too.:::['6-17-49']
oh, i would kill for a salmon-skin roll right now.:::['6-17-50']
you know what? fine, get attacked. i don't even care.:::['6-17-51']
come on, ross, we're sorry. please tell us what it is.:::['6-17-52']
unagi is a state of total awareness.:::['6-17-53']
okay? only by achieving true unagi......can you be prepared:::['6-17-54']
for any danger that may befall you.:::['6-17-55']
in case someone's trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat......or your kettle of fish?:::['6-17-56']
all i'm saying is, it's one thing being prepared......for an attack against, like, each other.:::['6-17-57']
whole other story being prepared for an attack, i don't know...:::['6-17-58']
a surprise!:::['6-17-59']
all right, you knew that was coming, but that doesn't mean you have unagi.:::['6-17-60']
ooh, if we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.:::['6-17-61']
you know what?:::['6-17-62', '6-20-316', '8-12-265', '9-10-275', '9-11-236', '7-2-255', '10-2-303', '2-8-308', '2-16-67', '2-16-191', '2-23-140', '5-21-113', '5-11-27', '5-13-55', '5-17-256', '4-9-160', '4-9-285', '4-19-27', '4-7-279', '4-2-137', '3-19-211', '3-13-311', '3-13-325', '3-17-195']
hey, hey, is monica here? no.:::['6-17-63']
okay, look, i need your help. i don't know what to get for valentine's day.:::['6-17-64']
well, valentine's day was two weeks ago, so i wouldn't get her a calendar.:::['6-17-65']
heh. she was working on valentine's day, so we're celebrating it tonight.:::['6-17-66']
oh, hey, why don't you book a day for both of you at one of those romantic spas?:::['6-17-67']
ooh, joey, that's actually a really good idea.:::['6-17-68']
yeah, and of course, crotchless panties.:::['6-17-69']
well, as appealing as that does sound to her boyfriend......and her brother......i can't. we promised:::['6-17-70']
we'd make each other gifts this year.:::['6-17-71']
oh, i love that. you guys.:::['6-17-72']
you can't make crotchless panties? you take...:::['6-17-73']
you take a pair of scissors and just cut... okay, okay, okay.:::['6-17-74']
so making things, that sounds so much fun.:::['6-17-75']
i thought so too, until i papier-mâchéd one of my eyes shut.:::['6-17-76']

of course not.:::['6-17-93', '6-7-324', '2-16-170']
i just have to, uh, go over to the place where i made it and pick it up.:::['6-17-94']
i can't wait. it's gonna be the best valentine's day ever.:::['6-17-96']
i can't believe it. make the presents. make the presents.:::['6-17-97']

hi, i'm joey tribbiani.:::['6-17-100']
and with all due respect, i'd like to donate some fluids.:::['6-17-101']
we're at the end of one of our research cycles......so we're not looking:::['6-17-102']
for applicants now.:::['6-17-103']
that's too bad. i've kind of been saving up.:::['6-17-104']
uh, you sure there's no studies i can participate in?:::['6-17-105']
well, here's a schedule of what's coming up.:::['6-17-106']
ah, thanks.:::['6-17-107']
oh, but this one starts now.:::['6-17-108']
that one is available now, but only identical twins are eligible.:::['6-17-109']
it's a twin study. but it's $2000.:::['6-17-110']
sorry. oh.:::['6-17-111', '3-22-66']
well, how about this one?:::['6-17-112']
"testing the effects of joey tribbiani on attractive nurse receptionists.":::['6-17-113']
we already got the results back on that one, and they're not good.:::['6-17-114']
that was good. wasn't that a blast?:::['6-17-115']
danger! danger! god, ross!:::['6-17-116']
what the hell was that?:::['6-17-117', '7-20-312', '5-19-16', '5-2-143']
a lesson in the importance of unagi.:::['6-17-118']
you're a freak.:::['6-17-119']
perhaps.:::['6-17-120']
now, i'm curious.:::['6-17-121']
at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?:::['6-17-122']
all right, so we weren't prepared.:::['6-17-123']
i'm sorry i had to take such drastic measures to make my point.:::['6-17-124']
but, look, i just want you guys to be safe.:::['6-17-125']
oh...:::['6-17-126', '6-21-153', '1-9-196', '8-21-271', '8-22-30', '7-4-171', '10-12-420', '10-15-290', '10-17-113', '10-17-382', '10-17-385', '4-19-210', '4-21-141', '4-7-138', '4-6-84', '4-5-136']

okay, are you aware that unagi is an eel?:::['6-17-138']
what's up? i can't figure out what to make monica.:::['6-17-139']
oh. why don't you make her one of your little jokes?:::['6-17-140']
i'm going crazy, okay?:::['6-17-141']
do you have anything around here that looks homemade?:::['6-17-142']
oh, you know what? she'd love this.:::['6-17-143']
it's an exact replica of apollo 8. i made it in the sixth grade.:::['6-17-144']
yeah, i guess i could use that. i could say, "your love sends me to the moon.":::['6-17-145']
yeah, yeah. except apollo 8 didn't actually land on the moon.:::['6-17-146']
but you could write, um::::['6-17-147']
"your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely.":::['6-17-148']
wait, i can't give this to her.:::['6-17-149']
why not? it says "captain ross" on the side.:::['6-17-150']
and it says "i hate monica" on the bottom. oh.:::['6-17-151']
phoebe & rachel: danger! ross: aah!:::['6-17-152']

you know, sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, aren't they?:::['6-17-211']
look, i know it sounds crazy, but i think it might work.:::['6-17-212']
but the only problem is carl's acting is::::['6-17-213']
the only problem?:::['6-17-214']
yeah. he's the reason i didn't get that big minute maid commercial.:::['6-17-215']

how do you know where dr. drake ramoray leaves off......and joey tribbiani begins?:::['6-16-104']
well, with dr. drake......they always tell me what to say.:::['6-16-105']

wow. mm.:::['6-16-107']
tell me something. whoa!:::['6-16-108']
i just fell right off the couch there. yeah, you did.:::['6-16-109']
i'm okay.:::['6-16-110', '6-7-299', '1-2-213', '8-19-290', '7-3-218', '5-22-132']

we can't do this. no!:::['6-16-119']
oyster? yeah.:::['6-16-120']
if... lf! if we did do this, there'd be a lot of pressure on me.:::['6-16-121']
because you've waited a long time, and i wouldn't want to disappoint you.:::['6-16-122']
but i have nothing to compare it to.:::['6-16-123']
so even if you were horrible, how would i know?:::['6-16-124']
i do like that.:::['6-16-125']
it's harder for me. i have four women to compete with.:::['6-16-126']
well, if it helps, there were only three.:::['6-16-127']
so it'd just be for tonight?:::['6-16-128']

stop it. we're not doing this.:::['6-16-130']
let's do it! no!:::['6-16-131']
okay! okay!:::['6-16-132']

oh, god, we... we didn't, uh?:::['6-16-154']
no. no, no.:::['6-16-155', '1-20-140', '10-2-314']
not after seeing that.:::['6-16-156']
god, i'm just a horrible person.:::['6-16-157']
well, why? because i'm married.:::['6-16-158']
that's right, i'm a married woman.:::['6-16-159']
i came to a tv star's apartment to have an affair. ugh!:::['6-16-160']
that's ridiculous.:::['6-16-161', '1-3-53']
i'm not a "star.":::['6-16-162']
i'm just a regular famous actor.:::['6-16-163']
and i'm a horrible, horrible person.:::['6-16-164']
rachel, will you stop saying that?:::['6-16-165']
hey. hey, look.:::['6-16-166']
remember on the show when capri was dying?:::['6-16-167']
and she gave me... the ring from the cave. yeah.:::['6-16-168']
uh, okay, well...:::['6-16-170']
uh...:::['6-16-171', '6-14-149', '6-12-177', '6-18-45', '6-18-197', '6-7-142', '6-1-222', '8-4-251', '8-7-251', '8-16-215', '8-16-231', '9-1-247', '9-6-277', '9-4-51', '9-8-81', '9-11-151', '9-16-112', '7-17-169', '10-10-119', '10-9-266', '5-2-286', '5-17-128', '5-15-197', '4-24-329', '4-18-200', '4-19-166', '4-19-295', '4-3-60', '3-8-160', '3-25-324', '3-20-248', '3-3-342', '3-10-235', '3-14-292', '3-15-306', '3-16-210']
oh, my god! they let you keep that stuff?:::['6-16-172']

and i want you to have it.:::['6-16-174']
no, i couldn't. yes. yes.:::['6-16-175']
and every time you look at it......i want you to remember:::['6-16-176']
that you are a good person.:::['6-16-177']
now, you had the chance to cheat......and with me.:::['6-16-178']
but you didn't. and that's what this ring stands for.:::['6-16-179']

look, you want the ring or not? yeah!:::['6-16-181']
ross: hey, look at you! you're up!:::['6-16-182']

"would anyone really miss me if i weren't here?":::['6-16-200']
but still, ross.:::['6-16-202']

if you see him, please tell him that i'm looking for him......and that this time:::['6-16-277']
i am not gonna throw up!:::['6-16-278']
are you okay? me? i'm great!:::['6-16-279']
i'm fine! i'm so good.:::['6-16-280']
but you know who's not great?:::['6-16-281']
men!:::['6-16-282']
you're a man, right, ross? yeah.:::['6-16-283']
sit down. okay.:::['6-16-284']
let me, uh, ask you something.:::['6-16-285']
do wedding vows mean squat to you people?:::['6-16-286']
why is it that the second we go out of town......bam, there you are in bed:::['6-16-287']
with the neighbor's dog-walker?:::['6-16-288']
we're sorry.:::['6-16-289', '1-19-235']
no, seriously. seriously. what has happened to the sanctity of marriage?:::['6-16-290']
didn't you spend last night at joey's? oh, what are you, a detective?:::['6-16-291']
i don't know what's going on with you and your husband......and what is hopefully:::['6-16-292']
an adult dog-walker.:::['6-16-293']
look, can i just say, not all men are like that.:::['6-16-294']
ugh. hey, there are some men......who'll do whatever:::['6-16-295']
to make their marriage work.:::['6-16-296']
there are some men who will stand by and watch......as their wives engage in what can:::['6-16-297']
only be described as a "twosome"......with some woman she barely knows:::['6-16-298']
from the gym!:::['6-16-299']
who are these men?:::['6-16-300']
just men. a guy i know.:::['6-16-301']
well, you might want to tell him it sounds like his wife......is gay.:::['6-16-302']
she is not...:::['6-16-303']
she's gay.:::['6-16-304']
she is so gay!:::['6-16-306']
i can't believe this.:::['6-16-307', '6-11-179', '1-19-160', '7-8-202', '7-13-221', '10-4-278', '10-9-337', '5-21-20']
good day for married people, huh?:::['6-16-308']
i'm sorry your husband cheated on you.:::['6-16-309']
i'm sorry your wife is gay.:::['6-16-310']
i guess women aren't that great either. try telling my wife that.:::['6-16-311']
okay to come in? yeah, come in, eat, whatever you want.:::['6-16-312']
dr. roger got beeped again.:::['6-16-313']
yeah, i know. guess who beeped him?:::['6-16-314']
what? i'm the ruptured spleen. ha, ha!:::['6-16-315']
why would you do that? because you shouldn't be with him.:::['6-16-316']
you should be with me.:::['6-16-317']
really? when you were talking about roger......that was killing me. look.:::['6-16-318']
things like last night don't just happen.:::['6-16-319']
at least not to me. i mean, with the other two women......in the morning, i couldn't wait:::['6-16-320']
to just go hang out with my friends.:::['6-16-321']
but with you......heh, i was, you know,already with a friend.:::['6-16-322']
chandler. you probably don't want to go out with me.:::['6-16-323']
i make too many jokes, i've never been in a serious relationship......and i guess i'm not:::['6-16-324']
technically a "doctor.":::['6-16-325']
there was just one woman, wasn't there?:::['6-16-326']
no, there were two.:::['6-16-327']
including me? oh, yeah.:::['6-16-328']
to finally make you see:::['6-16-329']
one of them won't do it but the second will set you free:::['6-16-330']
tell all your hate and anger it's time to say goodbye:::['6-16-331']
and that is just what i will do:::['6-16-332']
soon as those bastards i worked for die:::['6-16-333']
la, la-la la, la la la la la la la la la, la la la-la-la la:::['6-16-334']
oh. uh, hey, rach. i was just coming over here to, uh...:::['6-14-0']
oh, wait, i don't have to lie to you, you don't live here anymore.:::['6-14-1']
i'm eating their food. what are you doing?:::['6-14-2']
ross is on a date with my sister.:::['6-14-3']
they shut the drapes two and a half hours ago.:::['6-14-4']
whoa, i didn't know we could date your sister.:::['6-14-5']
joey, we know you steal our food.:::['6-14-6']
i'm good.:::['6-14-7']
monica: oh, are the drapes still closed?:::['6-14-8']
yeah. who should've shut their drapes is that perverted couple two doors over.:::['6-14-9']
is that a swing? oh, don't even ask.:::['6-14-10']
yuck.:::['6-14-11', '5-7-229']
i can't believe ross is going out with rachel's sister.:::['6-14-12']
when chandler made out with my sister, i was mad at him for 10 years.:::['6-14-13']
that was like five years ago. yeah, you got five years left.:::['6-14-14']
joey... you wanna make it six?:::['6-14-15']
oh, ross, hey. hi, how are you? there you are.:::['6-14-16']
rachel: can i get a cup of coffee?:::['6-14-18']
so how was your big date last night?:::['6-14-19']
uh, it was okay. yeah, it was fun.:::['6-14-20']
it was fun? ross: yeah.:::['6-14-21']
great.:::['6-14-22', '6-10-268', '6-13-75', '6-2-361', '1-20-160', '7-9-231', '7-5-82', '10-11-145', '5-23-114', '4-12-301', '4-22-110', '4-7-15']
so, uh... so did you guys hit it off?:::['6-14-23']
i guess so. so, uh... so did anything happen?:::['6-14-24']
because rumor has it you guys shut the drapes. heh.:::['6-14-25']
no, no, nothing happened.:::['6-14-26']
i shut the drapes to show her slides of my favorite fossils.:::['6-14-27']
oh, slides. ha, ha.:::['6-14-28']
so really nothing happened.:::['6-14-29']
something could've happened, all right? she really dug my slides.:::['6-14-30']
rachel: mm. and she was definitely giving me the vibe.:::['6-14-31']
was it the "please don't show me another picture of a trilobite" vibe?:::['6-14-32']
anyway...:::['6-14-33', '6-23-69', '1-2-171', '7-20-199', '10-15-52']
if she wasn't into me, why would she ask me out again?:::['6-14-34']
she asked you out again? yeah, uh-huh.:::['6-14-35']
tomorrow night. hmm.:::['6-14-36']
ross: valentine's day. the most romantic day of the year.:::['6-14-37']
who knows what could happen?:::['6-14-38']
i might not be shutting my drapes to show her my slides, if you know what...:::['6-14-39']
okay, okay, okay, i got it, i got it.:::['6-14-40']
i can't... i can't go with the you-and-my-sister thing.:::['6-14-41']
i just can't. it's just too weird, all right?:::['6-14-42']
i imagine the two of you together, i freak out.:::['6-14-43']
it just freaks me out, and i can't do it. ross: okay, okay, okay. no... yes. it's okay.:::['6-14-44']
it's okay.:::['6-14-45', '6-13-103', '10-3-5', '5-7-332', '4-5-230', '4-2-282', '3-6-193']
hey, it's too weird for you. i won't see her again.:::['6-14-46']
thank you. i... yeah. i mean, after tomorrow night.:::['6-14-47']
no, no, no. please, ross. i can't do it. it's gonna freak me out.:::['6-14-48']
ross: okay, okay, okay.:::['6-14-49']
okay. i'll tell her tonight i can't see her anymore.:::['6-14-50']
ross, thanks.:::['6-14-51']
you want me to call her right now? oh, no. no, no, no.:::['6-14-52']
i mean, come on, that's craz... i mean, that's crazy.:::['6-14-53']
so, what's going on with you? what is going on with you?:::['6-14-54']
well, um... oh.:::['6-14-55']
i may teach another class this semester. yeah, do it now. call her right now.:::['6-14-56']
this is my favorite part. yeah, me too.:::['6-14-57']
oh, you know what's sadder than this? bambi.:::['6-14-58']
i cried for three days with that movie. no, wait, two.:::['6-14-59']
because on the third day, my mother killed herself, so i was partly crying for that.:::['6-14-60']
well, see, now, that i can see crying over, but bambi is a cartoon.:::['6-14-61']
you didn't cry when bambi's mother died?:::['6-14-62']
yes, it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer.:::['6-14-63']
there's nothing wrong with crying. you don't have to be so macho all the time.:::['6-14-64']
i'm not macho.:::['6-14-65']
yeah, you're right.:::['6-14-66', '6-20-298', '8-17-265', '3-17-256']
i don't know what i was thinking.:::['6-14-67']
i guess i just never really cried, you know? i'm not a crying kind of guy.:::['6-14-68']
come on, man, there's gotta be something that gets you choked up.:::['6-14-69']
like, uh...:::['6-14-70']
what if you saw a three-legged puppy?:::['6-14-71']
i'd be sad, sure, but i wouldn't cry.:::['6-14-72']
okay, what if the puppy said, "help me, chandler.:::['6-14-73']
all the other puppies pick on me.":::['6-14-74']
cry? i just found a talking puppy. i'm rich.:::['6-14-75']
oh. i've got it. i have got it. pictures from your childhood.:::['6-14-76']
this will get you going good.:::['6-14-77']
all right, what's going on there? oh, that's parents' day, first grade.:::['6-14-78']
that's me with the janitor, martin.:::['6-14-79']
where are your parents? oh, they didn't wanna come.:::['6-14-80']
oh, chandler. monica: you poor thing.:::['6-14-81']
so that story doesn't make you cry?:::['6-14-82']
no. look, i don't cry. it's not a big deal, okay?:::['6-14-83']
no. it's not okay. it's not okay at all.:::['6-14-84']
you're dead inside.:::['6-14-85']
excuse me. phoebe: yeah?:::['6-14-86']
are you phoebe buffay? yeah.:::['6-14-87']
can i get your autograph? i'm your biggest fan.:::['6-14-88']
oh, you're my biggest fan? i've always wanted to meet you. hi. ha, ha.:::['6-14-89']
sure, yeah. wow.:::['6-14-90']
wow, thanks a lot.:::['6-14-91']
i just wanna say i think you're really talented.:::['6-14-92']
you're just saying that because you're my biggest fan.:::['6-14-93']
joey, listen, take good care of that guy. he's a fan.:::['6-14-94']
bye.:::['6-14-95', '6-19-48', '8-10-21', '9-9-181', '9-9-232', '10-1-68', '2-20-382', '5-1-276', '3-24-311', '3-19-22', '3-12-243']
so you saw me on days of our lives, huh?:::['6-14-96']
you want me to do a little dr. drake ramoray for you?:::['6-14-97']
i have no idea what you're talking about.:::['6-14-98']
but i just got phoebe buffay's autograph.:::['6-14-99']
oh. you're phoebe's fan. oh, yeah. i've seen all her movies.:::['6-14-100']
movies? that was phoebe buffay, the porn star.:::['6-14-101']
i don't think so. no, no, it was.:::['6-14-102']
she was in sex toy story 2......lawrence of a labia.:::['6-14-103']
and i got her autograph.:::['6-14-104']
the guys at the comic-book store aren't gonna believe this.:::['6-14-105']
gunther.:::['6-14-106', '10-17-190', '2-21-140']
hey, don't let that guy in here anymore. he just said phoebe's a porn star.:::['6-14-107']
well, i wouldn't call her a star, but she's really good.:::['6-14-108']
you should check out inspect her gadget.:::['6-14-109']
you'll never believe what just happened.:::['6-14-111']
ross totally blew me off and didn't even tell me why.:::['6-14-112']
oh, well. you know what, honey?:::['6-14-113']
the best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else.:::['6-14-114']
oh. oh, there is this great guy you will just love at work named bob.:::['6-14-115']
he's a real up-and-comer in human resources.:::['6-14-116']
thanks, but i'm not gonna date some random guy from your work.:::['6-14-117']
not random. bob.:::['6-14-118']
it's probably because i'm not mature enough or smart enough.:::['6-14-119']
maybe he doesn't like the way i dress.:::['6-14-120']
pfft. no, that can't be it. it's really gotta be the smart thing. ugh.:::['6-14-121']
i'm so stupid.:::['6-14-122']
i'm just this, like, incredibly pretty, stupid girl.:::['6-14-123']
no, honey.:::['6-14-124', '5-3-307']
okay. you wanna know why ross canceled the date?:::['6-14-126']
because i asked him to.:::['6-14-127']
you asked him to? rachel: mm-hm.:::['6-14-128']
why? because you are my sister......and ross and i have this huge history.:::['6-14-129']
you wanna go out with ross? no.:::['6-14-130']
you don't want him, but you don't want me to have him?:::['6-14-131']
you know, bob in human resources... ugh.:::['6-14-132']
i cannot believe you did this to me. you had me doubting how smart i was.:::['6-14-133']
you had me doubting my fashion sense.:::['6-14-134']
this is not that big a deal. just don't date ross.:::['6-14-135']
there's a million other guys out there. you have no right to tell me what to do.:::['6-14-136']
i'm not telling you what to do. i am telling you what not to do.:::['6-14-137']
why are you always so jealous of me? this is not about me being jealous of you.:::['6-14-138']
this is about you being a brat, wanting what you can't have.:::['6-14-139']
can't have?:::['6-14-140']
excuse me, the only thing i can't have is dairy.:::['6-14-141']
rachel: all right, all right. you just blew your chances at dating bob.:::['6-14-142']
who? in human resources!:::['6-14-143']
i am jealous of her?:::['6-14-144']
i mean, who does she think she is, princess caroline?:::['6-14-145']
you're jealous of princess caroline? do i have my own castle?:::['6-14-146']
hey. phoebe's not here, is she?:::['6-14-147']
no. oh, great, did you get a movie?:::['6-14-148']
but, uh, i don't think it's the kind you're gonna like.:::['6-14-151']
you didn't get more that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night, did you?:::['6-14-152']
sort of.:::['6-14-153']
guys, what's going on?:::['6-14-154']
phoebe's a porn star.:::['6-14-155']
rachel & chandler: what? joey: yeah.:::['6-14-156']
rachel: what are you talking about? where?:::['6-14-157']
"phoebe buffay in buffay the vampire layer.":::['6-14-158']
oh, my god. ha, ha. that's phoebe. where did you get that?:::['6-14-159']
down at the adult video place on bleecker.:::['6-14-160']
and i saw joey was about to go in, so i ran in ahead of him......to surprise him.:::['6-14-161']
and then... ha, ha. then i pretended that i didn't know he was in there.:::['6-14-162']
wow. i mean, i just can't... i can't believe this.:::['6-14-163']
you know? i mean, you think you know someone.:::['6-14-164']
even phoebe, who's always been somewhat of a question mark.:::['6-14-165']
hmm.:::['6-14-166', '1-20-205', '1-18-263', '8-13-48', '8-11-89', '7-2-96', '2-12-224', '2-15-184', '5-23-117', '5-23-266', '5-11-178', '4-24-192', '4-20-101', '3-4-112']
this is so bizarre.:::['6-14-167']
i guess it kind of makes sense, though. she had such a terrible childhood.:::['6-14-168']
hey, i had a terrible childhood and i don't do porn.:::['6-14-169']
yes, but you're dead inside. ah.:::['6-14-170']
all right, well, i'd better take that back. what? why? why?:::['6-14-171']
we can't watch that. i mean, that's phoebe.:::['6-14-172']
you're right. we shouldn't watch this. absolutely not. that goes back.:::['6-14-173']
but, you know, maybe a little bit. how about just the first half?:::['6-14-174']
hey, no, this is wrong, you guys. phoebe's our friend.:::['6-14-175']
i'm not gonna watch it. yeah.:::['6-14-176']
good for you, joe. yeah.:::['6-14-177']
ah. i thought i'd find you here, nosferatool.:::['6-14-178']
buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?:::['6-14-179']
actually, i was kind of hoping it would be the other way around.:::['6-14-180']
hold on, what is that on her ankle? her ankle is what you're watching?:::['6-14-181']
well, it's hard to tell.:::['6-14-182']
oh, god, if she would just stop moving.:::['6-14-183']
she's just doing her job.:::['6-14-184']
you sick bastards.:::['6-14-185']
oh. it's a tattoo. that's weird. phoebe doesn't...:::['6-14-186']
wait, that's ursula. that's not phoebe. that is ursula.:::['6-14-187']
wait, wait. i can watch that. rewind it. rewind it.:::['6-14-188']
what's up? oh, my god. what am i doing?!:::['6-14-190']
hey, sweetie. hey.:::['6-14-191']
chicken soup for the soul?:::['6-14-192']
there's no back to this couch.:::['6-14-193']
why are you reading this? you hate this kind of stuff.:::['6-14-194']
i figured i'd give it a shot.:::['6-14-195']
maybe one of those stories would make me cry.:::['6-14-196']
then you wouldn't think i was all dead inside.:::['6-14-197']
aw, that's so sweet.:::['6-14-198']
chandler, i don't care if you can't cry. i love you.:::['6-14-199']
oh, that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.:::['6-14-200']
stop it. i mean, come on, seriously. think about it.:::['6-14-201']
we get married, i'm up at the altar, and i'm like this::::['6-14-202']
i won't care.:::['6-14-203']
because i know that you'll be feeling it all in here.:::['6-14-204']
yeah? yeah.:::['6-14-205', '9-1-305', '9-14-14', '7-6-240', '5-16-64', '4-8-303', '4-20-54']
and if we have a baby one day......and the doctor hands it to you:::['6-14-206']
in the delivery room......and you don't cry, so what?:::['6-14-207']
and if we take him to college and we come home......and we see his empty room:::['6-14-208']
for the first time......and you got nothing?:::['6-14-209']
won't matter to me.:::['6-14-210']
well, i won't worry about this anymore, then.:::['6-14-212']
yeah. and, you know, if i die......from a long illness......and you're writing out my eulogy......and you open the desk drawer:::['6-14-213']
and find a note from me that says::::['6-14-214']
"i will always be with you"......and you still can't shed one tiny tear......i know you'll be crying a river inside.:::['6-14-215']
aw, i love you, sweet... what is wrong with you?:::['6-14-216']
you can't shed a tear for your dead wife?:::['6-14-218']
i mean, i left you a note from the beyond.:::['6-14-219']
so you didn't mean any of that? no, you robot!:::['6-14-220']
you damn kids. you ring my bell one more time, i swear to...:::['6-14-221']
oh, uh, jill. um...:::['6-14-222']
that's just a little game i play with the kids down the hall.:::['6-14-223']
they've really taken a liking to me.:::['6-14-224']
what's the matter?:::['6-14-225', '6-22-1', '1-20-95', '1-5-254', '8-16-276', '9-20-252', '7-10-165', '10-17-422', '2-21-81', '2-21-163', '5-8-227', '5-11-3', '4-10-50', '4-23-113', '4-4-60']
rachel and i had a really big fight. can i come in?:::['6-14-226']
i know we're not supposed to see each other anymore. i'm okay with that.:::['6-14-227']
i don't know anybody in the city, and i need somebody to talk to about it.:::['6-14-228']
oh, of course. what happened? i don't wanna talk about it.:::['6-14-229']
okay. um...:::['6-14-230', '6-3-353', '1-12-192', '2-2-291', '5-3-12', '5-12-74']
but you know what might cheer me up? what?:::['6-14-231']
seeing some more of your super-cool slides.:::['6-14-232']
wow, really? totally. i loved them.:::['6-14-233']
and maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.:::['6-14-234']
i'd love to. you wait right here. i'll go get the projector and my notes.:::['6-14-235']

what is my sister doing there, and why are the drapes shut?:::['6-14-263']
okay. rach, calm down, okay?:::['6-14-264']
she's really upset. we're just talking.:::['6-14-265']
i think she's trying to make something happen with you to get back at me.:::['6-14-266']
oh, so that's the only reason she could be here, huh?:::['6-14-267']
it couldn't have anything to do with the fact that i'm a good listener......and i put on a great slide show?:::['6-14-268']
ross, i am telling you, she is using you to get back at me.:::['6-14-269']
you know, i think i can take care of myself. i'll talk to you later. goodbye.:::['6-14-270']
whoa.:::['6-14-271', '6-3-185', '1-23-53', '1-19-256', '1-14-142', '1-15-335', '1-12-136', '7-2-77', '7-14-85', '2-13-306', '2-15-316', '2-6-39', '5-18-11', '5-12-214', '4-2-29', '3-21-35', '3-23-350', '3-5-61', '3-5-198']
uh, that was your sister, actually.:::['6-14-272']
she thinks you're just using me. heh.:::['6-14-273']
so?:::['6-14-274', '1-12-71', '9-15-196', '7-15-315', '2-2-140', '2-6-166', '2-4-243', '4-14-47', '3-24-283', '3-6-183']
so i just came from the company ursula works for.:::['6-14-276']
oh, no, not you too.:::['6-14-277']
no, no. i went to pick up phoebe buffay's checks.:::['6-14-278']
there were a lot of them.:::['6-14-279']
nice. phoebe: mm-hm.:::['6-14-280']
and i won't have to go back there anymore......because i gave them:::['6-14-281']
my "correct address.":::['6-14-282']
that's great, but isn't it gonna bother you that people think you're a porn star?:::['6-14-283']
oh, no, no. i know how to handle it.:::['6-14-284']
joey: good. yeah.:::['6-14-285']
you're trying to figure out where you know me from?:::['6-14-286']
all right, i'll give you a hint. from porn. okay?:::['6-14-287']
yeah, your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie!:::['6-14-288']
see? yeah.:::['6-14-289']
you, uh, may have been right about jill. oh, i knew it. what happened?:::['6-14-291']
um, she kissed me. what? you kissed?:::['6-14-292']
maybe we should give them some privacy. shh!:::['6-14-293']
look, i tried not to kiss her, okay?:::['6-14-294']
it doesn't sound like it. it's pretty easy not to kiss someone.:::['6-14-295']
you just don't kiss them. see? look at us right now, not kissing.:::['6-14-296']
let me finish, okay?:::['6-14-297']
she started kissing me, and i didn't stop it.:::['6-14-298']
i guess i just wasn't thinking.:::['6-14-299']
yeah, that's right. i'm gonna give you something to think about.:::['6-14-300']
ross: hold on.:::['6-14-301']
but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing.:::['6-14-302']
oh, well, thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.:::['6-14-303']
look, i realized if anything were to happen with me and jill......then nothing could ever happen:::['6-14-304']
with us.:::['6-14-305']
what? no, i mean...:::['6-14-306']
look, i don't know if anything is ever going to happen with us again, ever.:::['6-14-307']
but i don't wanna know that it never could.:::['6-14-308']
so i stopped it......and she got mad:::['6-14-309']
and broke my projector.:::['6-14-310']
i don't even know what to say.:::['6-14-312']
you're welcome.:::['6-14-314', '9-22-263', '9-15-299', '7-9-87', '10-1-340', '2-14-160', '2-19-91', '2-2-65', '5-19-116', '4-15-292', '3-11-59', '3-17-299']
oh, my god, are you crying?:::['6-14-315']
i just don't see why those two can't work things out.:::['6-14-316']
all right, i'm leaving. i'm not gonna spend one more day......with someone:::['6-14-317']
who's out to sabotage my every move.:::['6-14-318']
that's you, rachel.:::['6-14-319']
yeah, i got that.:::['6-14-320']
and you. i throw myself at you, and you say no?:::['6-14-321']
how gay are you?:::['6-14-322']
you take care, jill.:::['6-14-323']
okay, see you. bye-bye.:::['6-14-324']
i can't believe jill's gone.:::['6-14-325']
i can't help it. i opened a gate.:::['6-14-326']
hey, you guys, guess what?:::['6-15-0']
barry and mindy are getting a divorce.:::['6-15-1']
no. barry and mindy.:::['6-15-3']
oh, sorry. i hear "divorce," i immediately go to ross. heh.:::['6-15-4']
who's barry and mindy?:::['6-15-5']
barry was the guy i almost married, and mindy was my best friend.:::['6-15-6']
wasn't he cheating on you with her?:::['6-15-7']
that just means he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.:::['6-15-8']
can you imagine if i'd married him? how different would my life be?:::['6-15-9']
i know. i've always wondered how different life would be......if i'd never gotten divorced.:::['6-15-10']
which time? the first time!:::['6-15-11']
imagine if carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.:::['6-15-12']
i can't. i keep seeing it the good way.:::['6-15-13']
i bet i'd still be doing my karate.:::['6-15-14']
towards the end of our marriage, i did karate as a way of releasing the tension......from, you know,not doing anything else physical.:::['6-15-15']
maybe the problem was pronouncing it "ka-ra-tay.":::['6-15-16']
what if i was still fat?:::['6-15-17']
you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.:::['6-15-18']
sure i would.:::['6-15-19']
what? you guys think i'm that shallow?:::['6-15-20']
no, i think monica was that fat.:::['6-15-21']
hey, imagine if i'd never gotten fired off days of our lives.:::['6-15-22']
hey. hey, there's carol again.:::['6-15-23']
what if i had had the guts to quit my job?:::['6-15-24']
i'd probably be writing for the new yorker, being paid to be funny.:::['6-15-25']
but my job's fun too. i mean, tomorrow......i don't have to wear a tie.:::['6-15-26']
what if i'd taken that job at merrill lynch?:::['6-15-27']
what? merrill lynch?:::['6-15-28']
a massage client who worked there said i had a knack for stocks.:::['6-15-29']
why didn't you take it?:::['6-15-30']
at that time, you see, i thought that everything that rhymed was true.:::['6-15-31']
so i thought if i worked with stocks......i'd have to live in a box:::['6-15-32']
and only eat lox and have a pet fox.:::['6-15-33']
do you think if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?:::['6-15-34']
oh, my god. rachel green?:::['6-15-35']
aah! rob tilman!:::['6-15-36']
no, heh, no, it's me. ross.:::['6-15-37']
oh, i'm sorry. ross tilman.:::['6-15-38']
no. no, no. ross geller. of course! monica's brother.:::['6-15-39']
yeah. right. wow! how are you?:::['6-15-40']
good. good, i'm married. oh! me too! ha, ha.:::['6-15-41']
isn't it the best? oh, it's the best. heh.:::['6-15-42']
so, um, how's monica? really, really great.:::['6-15-43']
actually, she's right down the street. um, you should stop by and say hi.:::['6-15-44']
oh, i would love to. yeah, she'd be so excited.:::['6-15-45']
oh, okay. come on.:::['6-15-46']
wait, don't you have to pay for......busty ladies?:::['6-15-47']
no, that's okay. some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but i...:::['6-15-48']
so, monica, still going out with dr. boring, huh?:::['6-15-49']
he's not boring. he's just...:::['6-15-50']
he's just low-key.:::['6-15-51']
here you go, one hazelnut latte. thank you.:::['6-15-52']
you know, the hazelnut, actually not a nut.:::['6-15-53']
it's a seed.:::['6-15-54']
can anyone else name a well-known seed that's been masquerading as a nut?:::['6-15-56']
oh, dear god. let me think.:::['6-15-57']
oh, no. what's the matter?:::['6-15-59']
i got another rejection letter.:::['6-15-60']
they said my writing was funny, just not "archie comic funny.":::['6-15-61']
i gotta get back to the hospital.:::['6-15-62']
all right. okay.:::['6-15-63', '8-17-180', '2-1-199', '4-15-169', '3-21-108']
bye. bye-bye.:::['6-15-64']
oh, uh, by the way, the answer is the brazil nut.:::['6-15-65']
was his question, "what's more boring than him?":::['6-15-66']
hey, man. sorry about that archie thing.:::['6-15-67']
you, uh, need me to give you some money?:::['6-15-68']
hey, i may have no money, but i still have my pride.:::['6-15-69']
eh.:::['6-15-71', '6-24-313', '8-12-271', '7-7-59']
joey doesn't have to give you money.:::['6-15-72']
tv stars have assistants, right? that's an idea.:::['6-15-73']
if i hire an assistant, would you take money from her?:::['6-15-74']
no, joey. chandler could be your assistant.:::['6-15-75']
he could answer your fan mail and stuff.:::['6-15-76']
that would be great! let's do that!:::['6-15-77']
i could use the money. give me time to write.:::['6-15-78']
great! welcome aboard. okay!:::['6-15-79']
all right. i need to use the bathroom.:::['6-15-80']
since i don't need assistance in there, take a break!:::['6-15-81']
all right.:::['6-15-82', '6-22-322', '6-4-102', '6-1-267', '1-22-210', '1-20-161', '1-24-165', '1-18-154', '1-19-309', '1-17-23', '1-5-239', '8-7-145', '8-17-186', '8-19-94', '8-21-224', '9-3-42', '9-2-263', '9-6-338', '9-9-284', '9-16-318', '7-22-57', '7-24-66', '7-15-240', '7-14-295', '10-1-314', '2-8-69', '2-8-222', '2-8-336', '2-10-206', '2-11-222', '2-9-269', '2-17-262', '2-14-42', '2-14-349', '2-18-197', '2-24-157', '2-24-334', '2-7-309', '2-23-284', '2-22-129', '2-4-200', '2-21-151', '2-21-339', '2-5-94', '5-24-309', '5-18-120', '5-22-191', '5-21-195', '5-9-171', '5-9-340', '5-4-150', '5-4-167', '5-5-303', '5-7-339', '5-2-9', '5-2-120', '5-3-46', '5-3-100', '5-10-134', '5-13-123', '4-8-7', '4-8-96', '4-11-205', '4-10-294', '4-16-145', '4-16-149', '4-16-152', '4-18-265', '4-19-280', '4-20-93', '4-20-111', '4-5-100', '4-1-204', '4-1-315', '4-2-9', '3-8-232', '3-9-55', '3-25-313', '3-13-245', '3-6-63', '3-16-156', '3-16-237']

if i were, would i have shooting pains up and down my left arm?:::['6-15-157']
yes. then, yes. that is what i'm having.:::['6-15-158']
come on, pheebs, it's not that bad.:::['6-15-160']
most people'd be excited if they didn't work for a couple weeks.:::['6-15-161']
most people don't like their jobs. i love my job.:::['6-15-162']
i've been not working for three hours, and i'm already going crazy.:::['6-15-163']
i miss joan.:::['6-15-164']
honey, a heart attack is nature's way of telling you to slow down.:::['6-15-165']
i always thought it was nature's way of telling you to die. heh.:::['6-15-166']
you're not gonna die.:::['6-15-167']
i mean, you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today.:::['6-15-168']
i wish i was dead.:::['6-15-169']
let's take a walk.:::['6-15-170']
you should consider writing for talking out of your ass magazine.:::['6-15-171']
so what's going on with you?:::['6-15-172']
well, um, i've been doing a lot more of my karate.:::['6-15-173']
still a dry spell with carol? yeah.:::['6-15-174']
how long has it been since you've had sex?:::['6-15-175']
well, last weekend... that's not so bad.:::['6-15-176']
...will be two months......since i stopped trying.:::['6-15-177']
you need to spice things up.:::['6-15-178']
what do you mean? i don't know.:::['6-15-179']
you could tie her up. you could eat stuff off each other.:::['6-15-180']
dirty talk, ménage à trois, toys. wow.:::['6-15-182']
role-playing. you're warden, she's prisoner.:::['6-15-183']
you're the pirate, she's the wench. okay, i think i got it.:::['6-15-184']
you could be two stockbrokers, rolling naked on the trading floor......and everybody's watching.:::['6-15-185']
it never happened.:::['6-15-186']
and over there is brady's pub......where i unwind:::['6-15-187']
after a long day of "surgeoning.":::['6-15-188']
wow! this is so amazing. what else?:::['6-15-189']
well, that is a large piece of television equipment.:::['6-15-190']
and, uh, that is an old man.:::['6-15-191']
hey, old man! hey.:::['6-15-192']
alrighty. what do you say we head back to my place?:::['6-15-193']
well, wow. um, you know, i would really love to, but i shouldn't.:::['6-15-194']
why? why can't the world stop turning?:::['6-15-195']
just for a moment. just for us.:::['6-15-196']
isn't that a line from the show?:::['6-15-197']
uh, yeah, but, uh......i may have said:::['6-15-198']
those things before, but......i never truly meant them until now.:::['6-15-199']
that's a line from the show too!:::['6-15-200']
okay, you watch too much tv.:::['6-15-201']
joe, here's the freshly-squeezed orange juice you asked for.:::['6-15-202']
thanks. hi.:::['6-15-203', '1-10-42']
yeah, there's pulp in that.:::['6-15-204']
yeah? heh.:::['6-15-205']
i thought we talked about this. i don't like pulp.:::['6-15-206']
no pulp. pulp isn't juice. all juice. okay?:::['6-15-207']
i'm sorry. i guess i just like the pulp.:::['6-15-208']
god, i'm sorry. i am being so rude.:::['6-15-209']
rachel, would you like a soda or something?:::['6-15-210']
because chandler will run right out and get it.:::['6-15-211']
yeah, well, sure, iced tea would be great.:::['6-15-212']
iced tea.:::['6-15-213']
okay. anything for you, sir?:::['6-15-214']
did i not just tell him?:::['6-15-215']
okay, look, chandler, if this is gonna work......you have got to listen.:::['6-15-216']
you're gonna throw that juice at me, aren't you?:::['6-15-217']
it's not all juice.:::['6-15-218']
honey, this morning was fun, huh?:::['6-15-219']
me hopping in on you in the shower there?:::['6-15-220']
yeah, maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.:::['6-15-221']
look, carol, um, i was thinking maybe......maybe we can spice things:::['6-15-222']
up a little.:::['6-15-223']
what do you mean? carol, our sex life. it's just not...:::['6-15-224']
dad! hey there, little fella!:::['6-15-225']
hey, why don't we get some shoes on you?:::['6-15-226']
show dad how you put your shoes on in your room.:::['6-15-227']
yay! yay!:::['6-15-228']
yay!:::['6-15-229', '7-7-178', '10-7-119', '10-15-138', '10-17-71', '5-21-218', '3-2-304', '3-10-311']
seriously, our sex life.:::['6-15-230']
i was thinking maybe, i don't know......we could try some new things,you know, for fun.:::['6-15-231']
like what? well, i don't know. um...:::['6-15-232']
what if we, uh, were to......tie each other up?:::['6-15-233']
um, some people eat stuff off one another.:::['6-15-234']
um, you know, we could try dirty talk. uh, heh.:::['6-15-236']
um, we could have a threesome. i love that idea!:::['6-15-237']
who sold a story to archie comics?:::['6-15-238']
oh, my god, that's so great. oh, wow!:::['6-15-239']
you're a published writer. i wish i had a present.:::['6-15-240']
aw. wait a minute.:::['6-15-241']
my last kit kat bar.:::['6-15-242']
you want to share it? okay!:::['6-15-243']
chandler, i know you're mad. i'm sorry.:::['6-15-245']
i was a total jerk. completely over the line.:::['6-15-246']
i just... i hate pulp.:::['6-15-247']
you know how monica feels about low-fat mayonnaise?:::['6-15-248']
it's not mayonnaise!:::['6-15-249']
okay, uh, anyway, i just wanted to say i'm sorry, and here.:::['6-15-250']
what's this? fresh-squeezed orange juice, with pulp.:::['6-15-251']
just the way you like. aw, thanks, man.:::['6-15-252']
hey, joey? chandler sold a story to archie comics.:::['6-15-253']
oh, my god, that's great! congratulations! what's the story?:::['6-15-254']
oh, you wouldn't care. it's just a stupid comic book story.:::['6-15-255']
are you kidding me? i love archie and the whole gang.:::['6-15-256']
well, um, archie needs money to fix his jalopy.:::['6-15-257']
uh, but he doesn't want reggie to just give him the money.:::['6-15-258']
so reggie hires him as his assist...:::['6-15-259']
as his butler.:::['6-15-260']
and makes him do crazy things......like bring him milk shakes:::['6-15-261']
that can't have lumps.:::['6-15-262']
wait a minute. that sounds a little familiar.:::['6-15-263']
did they already do that? i think i read it!:::['6-15-264']
monica, listen. i have to ask.:::['6-15-265']
okay, joey tribbiani invited me back to his apartment.:::['6-15-266']
does he do this with a lot of girls? yeah, a lot. a lot, a lot.:::['6-15-267']
ah! and i'm one of them.:::['6-15-268']
i just cannot believe this. i mean, joey tribbiani.:::['6-15-270']
it's none of my business, but aren't you married?:::['6-15-271']
i wish we could just not be married for a little bit.:::['6-15-273']
you know, i just wish we could be, like, on a break.:::['6-15-274']
well, you're not.:::['6-15-275']
it's easy for you. you get to have sex with whoever you want.:::['6-15-276']
yeah, i can. ha.:::['6-15-277']
don't think i don't. i do.:::['6-15-278']
i mean, all the time. you bet!:::['6-15-279']
monica? hmm?:::['6-15-280']
you've done it, right?:::['6-15-281']
of course i have. what do you think, i'm like some 30-year-old virgin?:::['6-15-282']
oh, my god. you're a 30-year-old virgin.:::['6-15-283']
louder. i don't think the guy in the back heard.:::['6-15-284']
guy: yeah, i heard it.:::['6-15-285']
it's not like i haven't had the opportunity.:::['6-15-286']
i'm waiting for the perfect guy. mm-hm.:::['6-15-287']
i'm seeing this guy roger. he's not perfect......but, uh, i'm thinking maybe:::['6-15-288']
i should get it over with.:::['6-15-289']
you know, give him my flower.:::['6-15-290']
oh, my god, do it! honey, you've waited long enough.:::['6-15-291']
you know what? you are right. sex does not have to be a big deal.:::['6-15-292']
there shouldn't be all these rules and restrictions.:::['6-15-293']
people should be able to sleep with whoever, whenever...:::['6-15-294']
rachel. i'm never gonna think it's okay for you to cheat on your husband.:::['6-15-295']
oh, what do you know, virgin?:::['6-15-296']
phoebe?:::['6-15-297', '6-12-312', '6-25-124', '8-10-77', '2-22-254', '5-23-26', '5-22-180']
why is smoke coming out of the bathroom?:::['6-15-298']
phoebe: oh, yeah. the doctor said that could be one of the side effects.:::['6-15-299']
put the cigarette out.:::['6-15-300']
phoebe: no, it's not a cigarette. the smoke is coming out of me!:::['6-15-301']

ugh, we've been through this.:::['6-11-4']
don't do this to yourself.:::['6-11-5']
she made it clear it isn't going to happen.:::['6-11-6']
all right, then. i guess i shouldn't get too excited about the fact......that i just kissed her!:::['6-11-7']
are you serious? that's great!:::['6-11-8']
yeah, well, we'll see.:::['6-11-9']

it's awesome!:::['6-11-23']
i could do it forever.:::['6-11-24']
you know what? she kisses better than my mom cooks.:::['6-11-25']
i'm so glad you said "cooks." right?:::['6-11-26']
rachel, you've got to tell the post office that you've moved.:::['6-11-27']
we still get your bills and stuff.:::['6-11-28']
oh! oh! pottery barn! you can throw the rest away.:::['6-11-29']
i'm not your garbage man.:::['6-11-30']
i'm your mailman.:::['6-11-31']
monica, look.:::['6-11-32']
here is that table that i ordered. ah!:::['6-11-33']
you got it from pottery barn? yeah. it's an apothecary table.:::['6-11-34']
does anyone even know what an apothecary is?:::['6-11-35']
a pharmacist.:::['6-11-36', '6-11-37']
phoebe hates pottery barn.:::['6-11-38']
i hate pottery barn too.:::['6-11-39']
they kicked me out just because i sat on a bed.:::['6-11-40']
you took off your pants and got under the sheets.:::['6-11-41']
i was tired.:::['6-11-42']
phoebe hates pottery barn?:::['6-11-43']
she hates mass-produced stuff.:::['6-11-44']
she thinks her furniture should have a story behind it.:::['6-11-45']
this has a story behind it.:::['6-11-46']
they had to ship it all the way from the white plains store.:::['6-11-47']
it's got to be one-of-a-kind.:::['6-11-48']
like that god-awful ceramic fruit bowl she has on her counter?:::['6-11-49']
hey! i made that for her.:::['6-11-50']
you made pottery? yeah.:::['6-11-51']
i made it out of a fruit bowl i found in the garbage.:::['6-11-52']
if you put that in her apartment, you'll never hear the end of it.:::['6-11-53']
i'll tell her that it's an antique.:::['6-11-54']
she doesn't have to know where it came from.:::['6-11-55']
ah, i love these little drawers.:::['6-11-56']
oh, look! it says that it holds 300 cds.:::['6-11-57']
ah, just like the apothecary tables of yore.:::['6-11-58']
so the farmer says::::['6-11-59']
"that's not a cow, and you're not milking.":::['6-11-60']
i'm so glad you're together.:::['6-11-61']
we wanted a couple to go out with and now we have one.:::['6-11-62']
we're a couple of couples.:::['6-11-63']
i had so much fun tonight. what a great restaurant!:::['6-11-64']
and chandler, i can't believe i let you pay for this one.:::['6-11-65']
thanks again, man.:::['6-11-66']
if you come over tomorrow, i'll make pasta.:::['6-11-67']
that'd be great! okay.:::['6-11-68']
but at least let us bring the wine.:::['6-11-69']
you don't have to. ah, i insist.:::['6-11-70']
you'll get the wine, right? yeah.:::['6-11-71']
okay, good night. see you tomorrow.:::['6-11-72']
can't wait.:::['6-11-73']
how are we going to get out of that one?:::['6-11-74']
what? i can't handle two nights in a row......with them.:::['6-11-75']
what's wrong with them?:::['6-11-76']
they're just a little......blah!:::['6-11-77']
blah?:::['6-11-78']
well, you know, he's blah. she's just...:::['6-11-79']
she's very loud for such a small person.:::['6-11-80']
uh, they're my best friends.:::['6-11-81']
are you saying we can't go out? 'cause that'd be a problem.:::['6-11-82']
of course we can still hang out with them.:::['6-11-83']
just not two nights in a row.:::['6-11-84']
okay? i guess.:::['6-11-85']
i'll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.:::['6-11-87']
ooh! what a great table! where did you get it?:::['6-11-89']
guess.:::['6-11-90']
um, a flea market?:::['6-11-91']
ha, i knew you would get it on the first guess.:::['6-11-92']
isn't it cool? it's an apothecary table.:::['6-11-93']
ah, wow.:::['6-11-94']
you can just imagine that this is where......they kept all their stuff:::['6-11-95']
to make potions.:::['6-11-96']
you know? ooh, yes.:::['6-11-97']
ooh, you can almost smell the opium.:::['6-11-98']
almost.:::['6-11-99']
oh, how much was it?:::['6-11-100']
just only 500 bucks.:::['6-11-101']
500 bucks at a flea market?:::['6-11-102']
i thought you meant how much was it......when it was new, back then.:::['6-11-103']
oh, no. yeah, no.:::['6-11-104']
it was at a flea market, so it was like a dollar.:::['6-11-105']
a dollar? and fifty?:::['6-11-106']
so it was like one and fifty dollars.:::['6-11-107']
they gave you the old-time pricing. yeah.:::['6-11-108']
well, what period is it from?:::['6-11-109']
uh, it's from yore.:::['6-11-110']
like, the "days of yore," you know?:::['6-11-111']
yes. yes, i do.:::['6-11-112']
it's just perfect. oh, good.:::['6-11-113']
i bet it has a great story too.:::['6-11-114']
did they tell you where it's from or...:::['6-11-115']
yes, that i know. this is from, uh, white plains.:::['6-11-116']
white plains. mm-hm.:::['6-11-117']
ooh, it sounds like such a magical place.:::['6-11-118']
i'm here. hi!:::['6-11-119']
you like it? oh, my god!:::['6-11-121']
it's my new apothecary table!:::['6-11-122']
phoebe'll be here any second. she can't see this.:::['6-11-123']
why not? she'll love it. it's the real thing.:::['6-11-124']
i got it at pottery barn.:::['6-11-125']
i know. i bought the same one.:::['6-11-126']
and if she sees your table, she'll know i lied.:::['6-11-127']
i said ours was an original. why?:::['6-11-128']
because she hates pottery barn.:::['6-11-129']
she hates pottery barn?:::['6-11-130']
she says it's all mass-produced......nothing is authentic, and everyone:::['6-11-131']
winds up having the same stuff.:::['6-11-132']
so come on! can we cover this up, please?:::['6-11-133']
what? no, no.:::['6-11-134']
i am not gonna hide it from phoebe.:::['6-11-135']
although i did get some great pottery barn sheets.:::['6-11-136']
ooh, i forgot they made sheets!:::['6-11-137']
heh, yeah.:::['6-11-138']
i still can't believe she hates pottery barn.:::['6-11-139']
it's not like she hates you.:::['6-11-140']
yeah, but pottery barn?:::['6-11-141']
you know what i think? she's just weird.:::['6-11-142']
it's because she's a twin. twins are weird.:::['6-11-143']
she's not weird. she likes her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.:::['6-11-144']
huh. you know what's not one-of-a-kind? a twin!:::['6-11-145']
let's turn out the lights and watch the movie.:::['6-11-146']
hey, ooh, cool sheet! you like it?:::['6-11-147']
you want to know where i got it? sure.:::['6-11-148']
at a flea market.:::['6-11-149']
you buy your sheets at a flea market?:::['6-11-150']
come on, you gotta loosen the purse strings a little.:::['6-11-151']
dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.:::['6-11-153']
here is the wine to bring over tonight.:::['6-11-154']
you were also gonna buy monica flowers......but you couldn't because:::['6-11-155']
you paid for dinner last night.:::['6-11-156']
thanks. but, uh, it's just gonna be me tonight.:::['6-11-157']
what happened to janine? she's, uh, really sick.:::['6-11-158']
that's too bad. yeah, she's been in there all day.:::['6-11-159']
uh, high fever, nose problem. it's......phlegm, phlegm,phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.:::['6-11-160']
monica! chandler!:::['6-11-161']
i'm sorry about tonight. i don't know if joey told you......but i couldn't get out:::['6-11-162']
of going to this play.:::['6-11-163']
have a great time, huh?:::['6-11-164']
that's funny, i saw no phlegm.:::['6-11-165']
oh, no, she really is sick.:::['6-11-166']
then why is she going to a play?:::['6-11-167']
uh, well, you know, "starve a fever......go to a play for a cold.":::['6-11-168']
why is janine not coming over for dinner?:::['6-11-169']
uh, she didn't want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row.:::['6-11-170']
i'm so sorry.:::['6-11-171', '6-23-257', '8-16-268', '8-22-193', '10-1-372', '10-17-533', '5-13-52', '4-16-251', '4-3-329']
why doesn't she want to hang out with us?:::['6-11-172']
because she, uh, thinks that you are "blah.":::['6-11-173']
and that, uh, you, monica, are too loud.:::['6-11-174']
what?!:::['6-11-175', '9-20-171', '10-2-176']
so she just pretended to have a good time?:::['6-11-177']
she was lying to our faces?:::['6-11-178']
who is she to judge us?:::['6-11-180']
we couldn't have been nicer to her. and i am not "blah." i am a hoot!:::['6-11-181']
i know, i know.:::['6-11-182', '7-9-214', '5-19-311', '4-12-98']
come on, please, you guys. don't be mad.:::['6-11-183']
i'm sure she said it......because she was nervous 'cause:::['6-11-184']
you're my best friends.:::['6-11-185']
and it was our first date.:::['6-11-186']
plus, she's really sick.:::['6-11-187']
you said you made that up!:::['6-11-188']
but isn't the "sick" thing better than the "play" thing?:::['6-11-189']
they're both good. i generally just go with, "monica's drunk again.":::['6-11-190']
come on, please just give her another chance.:::['6-11-191']
she'll come around, i promise. of course we will.:::['6-11-192']
come on, we gotta make dinner. okay.:::['6-11-193']
monica: i do not like that woman!:::['6-11-194']
i can hear you!:::['6-11-195']
monica: i am loud!:::['6-11-196']
aw.:::['6-11-197', '6-13-264', '6-24-198', '6-24-245', '8-5-179', '9-10-251', '9-10-309', '7-11-89', '10-3-286', '10-13-132', '2-15-268', '2-6-327', '5-24-126', '5-24-277', '5-11-117', '5-17-210', '4-8-317', '4-10-54', '4-16-83', '4-20-103', '4-22-107', '4-23-316', '4-1-13', '3-3-147', '3-6-327']
phoebe: isn't it good?:::['6-11-198']
can you please not put your feet up on my new......old sheet.:::['6-11-199']
oh, sure.:::['6-11-200', '9-9-177', '3-23-191']
my apothecary table!:::['6-11-201']
phoebe: what? no!:::['6-11-202']
where did you get this? at pottery barn, okay?:::['6-11-203']
pottery barn has ripped off the design of our antique!:::['6-11-205']
wow. if they've ripped off our table......ours must be worth much more:::['6-11-206']
than one and fifty dollars.:::['6-11-207']
this doesn't even smell like opium.:::['6-11-208']
it smells like wine, which you spilled.:::['6-11-209']
and thanks for wrecking my sheet.:::['6-11-210']
ross, calm down. i'll give you the 80 cents.:::['6-11-211']
okay, one more time.:::['6-11-212']
would you like some orange juice?:::['6-11-213']
perfect decibel.:::['6-11-214']
uh, what are you guys doing?:::['6-11-216']
nothing. we're just talking. you know, blah-blah-blah.:::['6-11-217']
come on, you said you were gonna try.:::['6-11-218']
i came over to invite you to a movie with me and janine.:::['6-11-219']
what do you say? i'd like to......but i'm not sure if we have the time.:::['6-11-220']
ha, very funny. i don't know what to do.:::['6-11-221']
i really want you to get along.:::['6-11-222']
please, come to the movie with us. you owe me.:::['6-11-223']
we owe you? joey: that's right.:::['6-11-224']
i helped you out in the start of your relationship.:::['6-11-225']
i helped you sneak around for six months.:::['6-11-226']
i looked like an idiot.:::['6-11-227']
and i was humiliated.:::['6-11-228']
and i only made $200.:::['6-11-229']
we didn't give you any money.:::['6-11-230']
you don't think i know that?:::['6-11-231', '3-18-168']
i can't decide if it goes better by the new chair......the sahara desk......or the parker console table.:::['6-11-232']
i didn't know there was a pottery barn up here.:::['6-11-233']
i know, i went a little crazy. a little?:::['6-11-234']
your place looks like page 72 of the catalog.:::['6-11-235']
look at that!:::['6-11-236']
the ornamental birdcage! large. ha, ha.:::['6-11-237']
oh, ross? be careful. that is very old.:::['6-11-238']
colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.:::['6-11-239']
fascinating.:::['6-11-240']
another amazing find! wow.:::['6-11-241']
i bet this has a great story too. it does.:::['6-11-242']
it is a room-separating apparatus from colonial times.:::['6-11-243']
huh, a lot of this stuff is from the colonial times.:::['6-11-244']
what are some other time periods, rachel?:::['6-11-245']
well, there's yore.:::['6-11-246']
ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.:::['6-11-247']
rachel has such a good eye for this stuff.:::['6-11-248']
ross, if you ever decide to redecorate...:::['6-11-249']
and i think you should...:::['6-11-250']
you should ask rachel to help.:::['6-11-251']
aw, he doesn't need my help.:::['6-11-252']
i think he's ready to get rid of the... what'd you call it?:::['6-11-253']
the, uh, "cheap knockoffs and dinosaur junk"?:::['6-11-254']
you know, since you have such a great sense of what i need...:::['6-11-256']
uh, here's 60 bucks.:::['6-11-257']
why don't you take phoebe down to that colonial, uh, flea market......and get me some stuff?:::['6-11-258']
i don't think phoebe wants to come.:::['6-11-259']
i do want to. she does want to.:::['6-11-260']
she does want to. phoebe: yeah!:::['6-11-261']
i guess the flea market was just better last time.:::['6-11-262']
well, at least i got these sheets for ross.:::['6-11-263']
ugh, look at this. pottery barn.:::['6-11-264']
ugh, yeah, you know what? don't look at it.:::['6-11-265']
seriously, don't look at it. look!:::['6-11-266']
there's the table they stole from us.:::['6-11-267']
oh, those bastards! let's go.:::['6-11-268']
that fan kind of looks like ours, and the birdcage, and...:::['6-11-269']
wait a second, this is our exact living room!:::['6-11-270']
no, it's not.:::['6-11-271', '6-23-270']
come on, ours is totally different.:::['6-11-272']
i mean, we don't have the... we don't have that lamp.:::['6-11-273']
and that screen is on the other side.:::['6-11-274']
oh, my god. this is where you got all our stuff.:::['6-11-275']
pottery barn! oh, my god! no. no.:::['6-11-276']
okay, i did, all right? i'm sorry.:::['6-11-277']
i wanted this stuff and i know how you feel about pottery barn.:::['6-11-278']
come on, don't be mad. no, but i am mad.:::['6-11-279']
because this stuff is what's wrong with the world......and it's in my living room......and all i can think about is:::['6-11-280']
how i don't have that lamp!:::['6-11-281']
well, then, honey, buy the lamp.:::['6-11-282']
we have that 60 bucks from ross.:::['6-11-283']
i can't! i can't!:::['6-11-284', '8-12-276']
unless...:::['6-11-285', '9-1-163', '7-19-149']
are you saying you'd move out if i didn't buy that lamp?:::['6-11-286']
no, i'm not gonna move out!:::['6-11-287']
but are you saying that you would move out if i didn't buy that lamp?:::['6-11-288']
yes! i would so move out. then i don't have a choice.:::['6-11-289']
i have to buy that lamp! that's right.:::['6-11-290']
but at least the apothecary table's real.:::['6-11-291']
this was great. didn't everybody have a great time?:::['6-11-292']
i did. i really did. and i've got to say......i'm sorry if i was weird after:::['6-11-293']
the last time we went out.:::['6-11-294']
i guess i was just nervous.:::['6-11-295']
that's understandable. don't worry about it.:::['6-11-296']
so we can go out again?:::['6-11-297']
absolutely. janine: well, good.:::['6-11-298']
okay, well, good night. good night.:::['6-11-299']
see, huh?:::['6-11-300']
wasn't that fun?:::['6-11-301']
we have got to move.:::['6-11-302']
i knew it!:::['6-11-304', '6-20-242', '4-21-249', '4-1-310']
you're not so quiet yourself, missy!:::['6-11-305']
i'm blah? the only thing more boring than modern dance......is you talking about it.:::['6-11-306']
"oh, chandler......i just lost myself in the movement.":::['6-11-307']
you know, i know you're talking......but all i hear is:::['6-11-308']
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.:::['6-11-309']
all right, you and me! let's go, right now!:::['6-11-310']
all right, enough!:::['6-11-311']
enough! you two, go home. i gotta talk to janine.:::['6-11-312']
i really think you could take her.:::['6-11-313']
you better hope i don't see you in the hallway!:::['6-11-314']
all right. uh...:::['6-11-315']
look, we got a little bit of a problem here.:::['6-11-316']
you can't my treat my friends that way.:::['6-11-317']
they said stuff to me too. i know, i'll talk to them about it.:::['6-11-318']
they mean so much to me.:::['6-11-319']
they're like my family, you know?:::['6-11-320']
if you guys are gonna be fighting all the time...:::['6-11-321']
i don't think we can be together. it just can't work, okay?:::['6-11-322']
it can't.:::['6-11-323']
i'm very upset.:::['6-11-324']
would it help if i apologized?:::['6-11-326']
that'd be very helpful.:::['6-11-328']
what did i tell you about the hall?:::['6-11-329']
i was coming over to apologize for my behavior.:::['6-11-330']
i'd really like it if we could be friends.:::['6-11-331']
well, i know that would make joey happy, so......i would like that too.:::['6-11-332']
great. now, come on.:::['6-11-333']
i'm glad we worked it out. me too.:::['6-11-334']
i'll see you. bye.:::['6-11-335']
or i'll hear you. that's it, big girl!:::['6-11-336']
wait!:::['6-11-337', '10-15-250', '5-23-280']
you'd better run!:::['6-11-338']
did you hear that?:::['6-11-339', '9-17-334', '7-13-284']
what am i gonna do? i'm sorry, man.:::['6-11-340']
want to go watch? yeah!:::['6-11-341']
hey. ross: hey.:::['6-11-342', '6-13-26', '6-24-12', '9-15-158', '5-18-173', '4-14-81', '3-6-29']
how you doing? so, uh, did she move out?:::['6-11-343']
pretty much.:::['6-11-344', '4-13-283', '3-1-190']
i can't believe you just broke up with her.:::['6-11-345']
when it's not right, you know it.:::['6-11-346']
you okay? i'll be all right.:::['6-11-347']
you know what'd cheer you up? what?:::['6-11-348']
i'm giving this lecture on erosion theories tomorrow night.:::['6-11-349']
i think you should come.:::['6-11-350']
you're right, that did cheer me up.:::['6-11-351']
why is everybody using these tiny, little lights nowadays?:::['6-10-0']
i remember when people used big ones.:::['6-10-1']
that's a good story, grandpa.:::['6-10-2']
wow. monica's letting other people help decorate her tree?:::['6-10-4']
did someone get her drunk again, or?:::['6-10-5']
having a perfect tree is not what christmas is about.:::['6-10-6']
it's about being with loved ones.:::['6-10-7']
that is nice. and we're done. ta-da!:::['6-10-8']
it just doesn't quite feel like christmas to me.:::['6-10-9']
oh, here.:::['6-10-10']
see, now it feels like christmas.:::['6-10-11']
and that's the story of the dreidel.:::['6-10-12']
some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians......who'd bring palm branches into huts:::['6-10-13']
on the shortest day of the year......symbolizing life's:::['6-10-14']
triumph over death.:::['6-10-15']
and that was, like, 4000 years ago.:::['6-10-16']
so around the same time that you started telling this story.:::['6-10-17']
hey, you guys. hey. what's up?:::['6-10-18']
i had to get out of the apartment. janine's stretching all over the place.:::['6-10-19']
everywhere i look she's like...:::['6-10-20']
i can see why that's hard to resist.:::['6-10-21']
i like her so much.:::['6-10-22']
i'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.:::['6-10-23']
i know. and she's so sweet.:::['6-10-24']
i just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair.:::['6-10-25']
you are aware that she's not a monkey, right?:::['6-10-26']
i am so over janine.:::['6-10-27']
yeah, at first i thought she was hot, but now she's like old news.:::['6-10-28']
hey, guys. janine!:::['6-10-29']
i'm gonna be a dancer on a tv special for new year's eve.:::['6-10-30']
it's called some sort of dickin' rockin' dicky eve.:::['6-10-31']
hold it.:::['6-10-32']
are you talking about dick clark's new year's rockin' eve?:::['6-10-33']
yeah, that's what i said.:::['6-10-34']
oh, my god, we love that show!:::['6-10-35']
ross and i have been watching it since i can remember.:::['6-10-36']
you're still just a little fat girl inside, aren't you?:::['6-10-37']
i'm gonna be one of the party people.:::['6-10-38']
you're gonna be a party person? those guys rock the most!:::['6-10-39']
they said to bring someone. want to be my dance partner?:::['6-10-40']
i would love to spend new year's with you.:::['6-10-41']
they're taping tomorrow. i don't understand why...:::['6-10-42']
well, how it works is......the part with dick clark:::['6-10-43']
in times square is actually live.:::['6-10-44']
but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time.:::['6-10-45']
not a lot of people know that.:::['6-10-46']
do you guys want to come too?:::['6-10-47']
are you serious? we are there!:::['6-10-48']
what are you laughing at?:::['6-10-49']
well, i used to date him, but you're still going out with her.:::['6-10-50']
thanks. great, so we can all go together.:::['6-10-51']
i gotta run. i'll catch you later.:::['6-10-52']
bye, janine.:::['6-10-53']
did she just ask me out on a date?:::['6-10-54']
i don't think so.:::['6-10-55', '6-10-176', '6-24-249', '8-24-81', '9-20-75', '9-21-109', '9-10-247', '7-23-82', '7-22-297', '7-15-285', '5-24-273']
she invited him to the biggest party of the millennium.:::['6-10-56']
yeah, but she also invited you and ross.:::['6-10-57']
i'm sorry, i don't think that that was a romantic thing.:::['6-10-58']
well, maybe. but, hey, i know how i can find out.:::['6-10-59']
it's a new year's eve party.:::['6-10-60']
so at midnight, i can kiss her. and if she kisses me back, great.:::['6-10-61']
if she says, "what are you doing?":::['6-10-62']
i can say, "it wasn't me, it was new year's.":::['6-10-63']
that's better than ross kissing me in high school......and saying that he did it:::['6-10-64']
because he needed chap stick.:::['6-10-65']
it was a dry day.:::['6-10-66']
we are going to dick clark's new year's rockin' eve!:::['6-10-67']
okay, i've been on sets before......so let me give you some advice.:::['6-10-69']
it's a show, but we're just dancing. it's no big deal.:::['6-10-70']
important thing to remember: stay cool.:::['6-10-71']
got it. okay.:::['6-10-72']
ross: oh, my god! it's just like i dreamed it!:::['6-10-73']
everyone! gather up!:::['6-10-74']
monica: excuse us! ross: excuse us!:::['6-10-75']
the music's gonna start, you're gonna dance......we'll tape it. don't look:::['6-10-76']
at the camera. questions?:::['6-10-77']
uh, yeah, i have a question. uh, when is this gonna air?:::['6-10-78']
yeah. now, uh, you guys dance over there......you guys, over there.:::['6-10-79']
i want you two here.:::['6-10-80']

so when is it gonna air?:::['6-10-82']
you look in the kitchen, i got the closet.:::['6-10-83']
i can save you time, ladies. i'm right here.:::['6-10-84', '9-10-64']
yeah. why don't you take a walk? this doesn't concern you.:::['6-10-85']
we're looking for our presents from monica.:::['6-10-86']
chandler: that's terrible.:::['6-10-87']
no, we do it every year.:::['6-10-88']
oh, well, that makes it not terrible.:::['6-10-89', '9-10-69']
yeah, we never find them.:::['6-10-90']
she's always bested us, that wily... minx.:::['6-10-91']
we'll search here for an hour......and then we'll go to joey's:::['6-10-92']
and search, okay?:::['6-10-93']
you can't look for monica's presents. we have to.:::['6-10-94']
you don't have to. and you can't, because i live here too.:::['6-10-95']
well, then you should look with us.:::['6-10-96']
aren't you worried about what to get monica?:::['6-10-98']
no, i have a great idea for her present.:::['6-10-99']
oh, that's it? a great idea? oh, yeah?:::['6-10-100']
what if she gets you a great present......two mediums:::['6-10-101']
and lots of little ones......and you just get her one present?:::['6-10-102']
she'll feel bad.:::['6-10-103']
why would you do that to her? why? why?:::['6-10-104']
if i help, we can find them faster! right!:::['6-10-105']
phoebe: ooh! ooh! we have a live one!:::['6-10-106']
oh, it's a macy's bag! yeah.:::['6-10-107']
rachel: aw! ooh! who's it for?:::['6-10-108']
"dear losers, do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch?:::['6-10-109']
p.s. chandler, i knew they'd break you.":::['6-10-110', '9-10-89']
uh-oh. she may be onto us.:::['6-10-111']
we are so gonna find them this year.:::['6-10-112']
you said you'd go across the hall and look. do you do that every year?:::['6-10-113']
you don't go into the back of my closet......and look under my gym bag:::['6-10-115']
or anything?:::['6-10-116']
no. never do that. no.:::['6-10-117']
that's where joey gave me stuff to store that i've never seen.:::['6-10-118']
okay, that did not just happen.:::['6-10-119']
means no" playing over speakers]:::['6-10-120']
here comes a camera.:::['6-10-121']
right. no biggie. stay loose.:::['6-10-122']
why do they keep doing that? ugh!:::['6-10-123']
we have to get up on one of those platforms.:::['6-10-124']
they've been taping them all day.:::['6-10-125']
right.:::['6-10-126', '1-21-169', '1-17-96', '1-17-251', '1-3-41', '8-24-215', '9-16-285', '7-24-106', '7-4-169', '2-17-196', '2-18-133', '2-18-200', '2-18-208', '2-4-294', '5-20-308', '5-4-89', '5-1-261', '5-1-265', '4-24-217', '3-6-242']
what'd you guys do to get up on there?:::['6-10-127']
we learned how to dance.:::['6-10-128']
when you learned to dance, did you forget how to put on underpants?:::['6-10-129']
yeah!:::['6-10-130', '8-21-210', '7-6-27', '10-11-71', '10-8-55', '5-3-262', '5-17-104', '4-5-216', '3-2-246']

our own platform.:::['6-10-196']
was it that good?:::['6-10-197']
we got honorable mention in the brother-sister dance category!:::['6-10-198']

what's the matter with you? go!:::['6-10-215']
yeah, take a hike, wet pants!:::['6-10-216']
can you believe this?:::['6-10-217', '7-15-235', '2-9-208']

you haven't been practicing the routine, have you?:::['6-10-220']

going into the robot.:::['6-10-224']
ross? we should stick to the routine. we don't want to look stupid.:::['6-10-225']
all right, we're back! ten seconds left.:::['6-10-226']

hey, look who i found.:::['6-10-236']
oh, hi, guys!:::['6-10-237']
birds have a very good sense of direction.:::['6-10-238']
i thought maybe they could help us find the presents.:::['6-10-239']
yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.:::['6-10-240']
or we could just follow your clever jokes. any ideas? didn't think so.:::['6-10-241']
come on, show us where the presents are.:::['6-10-242']
the duck seems to think that monica got me garbage.:::['6-10-243']
i wonder what i could get monica that's as good as garbage.:::['6-10-244']
hmm. how about my "az"?:::['6-10-245']
hey. this is hollow. what?:::['6-10-246']
this bench, it's hollow. i can't believe i never knew that!:::['6-10-247']
oh, the presents! don't look directly at them!:::['6-10-248']
all right, no, we could look at them.:::['6-10-250']
rachel: this one's for me!:::['6-10-251']
phoebe: this one's for chandler. here.:::['6-10-252']
and the big one's for me! oh, let's open them!:::['6-10-253']
wait a minute. we can't do this. phoebe: why?:::['6-10-254']
i don't want to know what monica got me.:::['6-10-255']
i'm sure she worked hard at getting it and wanting to surprise me.:::['6-10-256']
and you guys are gonna ruin that.:::['6-10-257']
we have to put them back. this isn't what christmas is about.:::['6-10-258']
whatever, linus. i'm opening mine.:::['6-10-259']
nobody is opening anything, okay?:::['6-10-260']
i want to see the look on her face when i give her my present.:::['6-10-261']
i'm sure she wants to see the look on my face when i get mine.:::['6-10-262']
so, please, please, can we just? can we put them back?:::['6-10-263']
will you get us better gifts? fine.:::['6-10-264']
you found the presents?:::['6-10-266']

that's what you got me? yes, i see. that look is priceless.:::['6-10-270']
home sweet home, huh?:::['6-10-271']
nice to, uh, get back to reality.:::['6-10-272']
plus, we, uh, know how the new year's gonna go off.:::['6-10-273']
i guess there's no reason for all that y2k panic, you know?:::['6-10-274']
anyway, good night.:::['6-10-275']
joey? yeah?:::['6-10-276', '10-12-415', '3-13-338']

tonight when they yelled "cut" and we didn't get to kiss......i was really, really disappointed,and i just...:::['6-10-280']
i just really wanted to kiss you.:::['6-10-281']
in the moment, i really wanted to kiss you too. in the moment.:::['6-10-283']
in the moment. but only in the moment.:::['6-10-284']
so do you, uh, want to kiss again?:::['6-10-285']
sure. new year's eve is only two weeks away.:::['6-10-286']
can you wait?:::['6-10-287']
three, two...:::['6-10-290']
you don't have to count down every time we kiss.:::['6-10-291']
oh. okay.:::['6-10-292', '1-17-230', '8-17-116', '4-6-22']
except i sort of felt like i needed a couple seconds to get ready.:::['6-10-293']
we were on the platform, ready to dance into the new millennium......and the guy yells "cut!":::['6-10-294']
so you guys are telling me that you actually did......the routine from eighth grade?:::['6-10-295']
yeah! but of course we had to update it a little bit.:::['6-10-296']
hey, by the way, quick thinking about catching me.:::['6-10-297']
there's no way you could've done the end......the way you guys did it back then.:::['6-10-298']
what? we could do it.:::['6-10-299']
i don't know. you were a lot bigger... i mean, stronger back then.:::['6-10-300']
i can do it, okay?:::['6-10-301']
come on, let's go! come on.:::['6-10-302']
one, two, three, four......five, six, seven, eight.:::['6-10-303']
i can't do it! ross: ahh!:::['6-10-304']

hey. you're not gonna believe this.:::['6-12-0']
i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy.:::['6-12-1']
they printed it. yeah.:::['6-12-2']
i didn't know they prints jokes.:::['6-12-3']
they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism.:::['6-12-4']
it's not just about the pictures.:::['6-12-5']
it didn't work on mom, it's not gonna work on us.:::['6-12-6']

uh, oh, oh. no, you didn't. i did.:::['6-12-13']
uh, uh, oh. yes, i did. i told dan and he said it was the funniest joke he'd ever heard.:::['6-12-14']

monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?:::['6-12-18']
no. seriously?:::['6-12-19']
you tell a lot of jokes.:::['6-12-20']
look, it's my joke.:::['6-12-21']
but if it makes you feel any better, they don't print the name.:::['6-12-22']
so it doesn't really matter who gets credit.:::['6-12-23']
yeah, i guess.:::['6-12-24', '1-13-308', '3-20-192']
hey, guys. joey, playboy printed my joke!:::['6-12-25']
no, it's mine! it's my joke. call them! they'll tell you!:::['6-12-26']

did your cable go out? no. no, that's vh1.:::['6-12-38']
i gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today......it's a lot of noise to me.:::['6-12-39']
why is your cable out?:::['6-12-40']
uh... oh, because i haven't really paid the bill. heh, heh.:::['6-12-41']
if you need money, would you please let me loan you some money?:::['6-12-42']
no, chandler. forget about it, okay?:::['6-12-43']
i know things have been tight since janine moved out. god, was she hot.:::['6-12-44']

i want to look too!:::['6-12-54']
yikes!:::['6-12-55']
do you think these pictures are trying to tell a story?:::['6-12-56']
sure. like in the case of this young woman......she has lost her clothes.:::['6-12-57']
so she rides naked on the horse, she's crying out, "where are they? where are they?":::['6-12-58']
she's not gonna find them, lying in the grass like that.:::['6-12-59']
phoebe: oh. yeah.:::['6-12-60']
remember the days when you'd go out to the barn......lift up your shirt and bend over?:::['6-12-61']
rachel: yeah.:::['6-12-62', '10-10-25', '5-1-307', '5-16-71', '4-18-256']
you see, now, i would date this girl.:::['6-12-63']
she's cute, she's outdoorsy.:::['6-12-64']
and she knows how to build a fire. that'll come in handy.:::['6-12-65']
i got a question.:::['6-12-66']
if you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?:::['6-12-67']
i don't know. me neither.:::['6-12-68']
rachel.:::['6-12-69', '6-18-46', '6-2-290', '6-2-314', '8-8-234', '10-17-532']
i don't know.:::['6-12-71', '6-25-152', '6-25-230', '6-7-98', '6-3-49', '6-3-232', '6-1-29', '1-22-88', '1-9-152', '1-20-343', '1-24-154', '1-24-202', '1-24-290', '1-13-79', '1-13-112', '8-1-139', '8-12-234', '9-9-127', '7-19-44', '7-2-152', '7-15-62', '7-13-102', '7-12-38', '7-12-214', '10-7-278', '10-3-261', '10-11-335', '10-14-350', '10-17-66', '2-8-144', '2-8-157', '2-6-41', '2-6-133', '2-5-141', '5-9-168', '5-9-254', '5-7-252', '5-1-77', '5-12-7', '5-12-9', '4-19-187', '4-19-211', '4-19-273', '4-23-216', '4-7-190', '3-18-228', '3-8-161', '3-8-193', '3-8-243', '3-25-277', '3-21-133', '3-21-352', '3-20-194', '3-17-306']
you know, you forget how many great songs heart had.:::['6-12-73']
chandler: yeah.:::['6-12-74']
"barracuda" was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard.:::['6-12-75']
so you heard it, you repeated it......so that must mean you wrote it.:::['6-12-76']
oh, you guys with this joke. well, i gotta say......i know i cracked up,but i'm not even sure i got it.:::['6-12-77']
you didn't get it?:::['6-12-79', '2-16-258']
the doctor is a monkey.:::['6-12-80']
and monkeys can't write out prescriptions.:::['6-12-81']
you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.:::['6-12-82']
your joke?:::['6-12-83']
well, i think the hef would disagree.:::['6-12-84']
which is why he sent me a check......for $100.:::['6-12-85']
so you stole my joke and you stole my money?:::['6-12-86']
i was gonna stick it in the atm.:::['6-12-87']
but now i think i'll show the sexy teller......that i am a published writer.:::['6-12-88']
well, she'll know that you stole the joke.:::['6-12-89']
you gonna follow me down there?:::['6-12-90']

uh, gunther?:::['6-12-95']
i can't pay for this now, because i'm not working.:::['6-12-96']
i've had to cut down on some luxuries like......paying for stuff, so...:::['6-12-97']
well, if you want, you can work here.:::['6-12-98']
uh, i don't know.:::['6-12-99']
it's just...:::['6-12-100', '8-7-167', '5-9-288']
see, i was a regular on a soap opera, you know?:::['6-12-101']
and to go from that to this, it's just...:::['6-12-102']
and plus, i'd have to wait on all my friends.:::['6-12-103']
okay. but the money's good.:::['6-12-104']
plus, you get to stare at rachel as much as you want.:::['6-12-105']
flexible hours.:::['6-12-107']
maybe i could be a waiter.:::['6-12-108']
could i use the phone?:::['6-12-109']
she picked rachel.:::['6-12-110']
she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. she picked rachel.:::['6-12-111']
he took my joke. he just took it.:::['6-12-112']
this is wrong. you know what else is wrong?:::['6-12-113']

picking rachel. that's right.:::['6-12-120']
did you hear something?:::['6-12-121']
maybe it's the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.:::['6-12-122']
it's coming from the living room.:::['6-12-123']
i finished my book.:::['6-12-124']

why would you do that?:::['6-12-133', '6-21-6', '9-11-284']
why didn't you pick me?:::['6-12-134']
fine.:::['6-12-135', '1-12-141', '1-12-148', '1-12-175', '8-3-111', '8-7-188', '8-13-157', '9-12-121', '7-6-144', '7-7-21', '10-2-292', '5-22-232', '5-9-217', '5-10-268', '4-10-274', '4-6-71', '3-16-261']
the reason i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you......is just, you know, you're......high maintenance.:::['6-12-136']
let's go to lunch.:::['6-12-137', '7-24-104']
that is completely untrue.:::['6-12-138', '6-7-200']
you think i'm high maintenance? prove it.:::['6-12-139']
you write out a list, and we'll go through it point by point.:::['6-12-140']
no, you're right, you're easygoing.:::['6-12-141']
you're just not as easygoing as rachel. she's just more......flexible and mellow. that's all.:::['6-12-142']
well, people are different.:::['6-12-143']
yeah, rachel will do whatever you want. you can just walk all over her.:::['6-12-144']
what? are you saying, that i'm a pushover? i'm not a pushover.:::['6-12-145']
oh, okay. you're not a pushover.:::['6-12-146']
you think i'm a pushover. well, watch this.:::['6-12-147']
you're not invited to lunch!:::['6-12-148']
what do you think? i think that's pretty strong.:::['6-12-149']
come on, monica, let's go to lunch.:::['6-12-150']
pssh.:::['6-12-151']
you start working on that list.:::['6-12-152']
i cannot believe her. i know. where do you want to eat?:::['6-12-153']
oh... oh, i love that japanese place. i'm sick of japanese. not going there.:::['6-12-154']
wherever you want to go is cool. all right.:::['6-12-155']
oh, hey, gunther......check this out.:::['6-12-156']
yeah. man, that chandler cracks me up.:::['6-12-157']
hey, ross, you want anything to drink? i'm heading up there.:::['6-12-158']
yeah. i'll take a coffee. thanks. sure.:::['6-12-159']
coffee? no.:::['6-12-160']
coffee? i'm going up there.:::['6-12-161']
rachel: no. no, thank you.:::['6-12-162']
you need anything? i'm heading up there.:::['6-12-163']
i'd love ice water.:::['6-12-164']
you got it.:::['6-12-165', '7-8-316', '10-11-60', '2-14-46', '3-18-212']
joey, what are you doing?:::['6-12-166', '5-1-96']
just being friendly.:::['6-12-167']
joey, you're not supposed to go back there.:::['6-12-168']
no, it's okay. right, gunther?:::['6-12-169']
don't wink at me.:::['6-12-170']
and put on your apron.:::['6-12-171']
okay. heh, heh.:::['6-12-172']
i don't see you asking other paying customers to put on aprons.:::['6-12-173']
joey, do you work here? no.:::['6-12-174']
waiter. yeah!:::['6-12-175']
joey, what's going on? why didn't you tell us you work here?:::['6-12-176']
it's kind of embarrassing. i mean, i was an actor, now i'm a waiter.:::['6-12-178']
it's supposed to go in the other direction.:::['6-12-179']
so's your apron. you're wearing it like a cape.:::['6-12-180']
i mean, the job's easy and the money's good, you know?:::['6-12-181']
i guess if i'm hanging out here, i might as well get paid for it. right?:::['6-12-182']
i just feel kind of weird serving you guys, you know?:::['6-12-183']
monica: it'll be great.:::['6-12-184']
come on, i did it and it was fine.:::['6-12-185']
why would it be weird?:::['6-12-186']
hey, joey? can i get some coffee?:::['6-12-187']
okay. it doesn't seem that weird.:::['6-12-188']
seriously, i asked before. you still haven't gotten it.:::['6-12-189']
see, now it's weird again.:::['6-12-190']
i think it's great. you're gonna make a lot of money. here's your first tip.:::['6-12-191']
don't eat yellow snow. ha, ha, ha.:::['6-12-192']
2: 15, coffeehouse.:::['6-12-193']
this is great. finally, i have someone i can pass my wisdom to.:::['6-12-194']
let me tell you some things i learned working at the coffeehouse.:::['6-12-195']
first, the customer is always right.:::['6-12-196']
a smile goes a long way.:::['6-12-197']
and if anyone is ever rude to you, sneeze muffin.:::['6-12-198']
thanks, rach.:::['6-12-199', '1-12-164']
hey, look, you guys are just terrific, you know?:::['6-12-200']
how about clearing out so i can get some new customers, huh?:::['6-12-201']
it's all about turnover.:::['6-12-202']
seriously, can i get my coffee?:::['6-12-204']
i'm sorry, ross. i'll get it right now.:::['6-12-205']
and since you wait, i'll toss in a free muffin.:::['6-12-206']
phoebe, we'd like to talk to you.:::['6-12-207']
so, maybe i am a little high maintenance.:::['6-12-209']
and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover.:::['6-12-210']
but you know what we decided you are?:::['6-12-211']
we are sorry to tell you this, but you, phoebe, are flaky.:::['6-12-212']
ha!:::['6-12-213', '8-9-186', '9-19-273', '9-4-69', '9-4-76', '7-10-120', '3-18-17']
that's true, i am flaky.:::['6-12-214']
so, what, you're just okay with being flaky?:::['6-12-215']
yeah, totally.:::['6-12-216']
then i'm okay with being high maintenance.:::['6-12-217']
yeah. and i am okay with being a pushover.:::['6-12-218']
that's great. good for you guys.:::['6-12-219']
i am not high maintenance! i am not a pushover!:::['6-12-220']
who said you were? both: you did!:::['6-12-221']
i'm flaky. i'll say anything.:::['6-12-222']
joey: hey, gunther.:::['6-12-223']
can you cover for me? i got an audition.:::['6-12-224']
no, i'm leaving to get my hair dyed.:::['6-12-225']
really? i like your natural color.:::['6-12-226']
it's a great part. check it out. i'm the lead guy's best friend.:::['6-12-227']
i wait for him in this bar and save his seat. listen.:::['6-12-228']
"i'm sorry, that seat's saved.":::['6-12-229']
that's the whole part? okay, maybe he's not his best friend, but...:::['6-12-230']
okay, i'll see you in an hour.:::['6-12-231']
oh, man.:::['6-12-232', '6-22-15', '6-6-289', '6-7-121', '9-3-305', '7-20-268', '10-12-86', '5-18-167', '5-18-312', '4-8-271', '4-9-86', '4-12-61', '3-14-110']
i could totally get that part. "i'm sorry, this seat is taken.":::['6-12-233']
excuse me. no, i didn't mean you.:::['6-12-234']
but you believed me, huh?:::['6-12-235']
i believed you were saving this seat for someone.:::['6-12-236']
so you'd hire me, right?:::['6-12-237']
for what?:::['6-12-238']
exactly! all right, everybody listen up!:::['6-12-239']
the coffeehouse will be closed for about an hour.:::['6-12-240']
customers: what?:::['6-12-241']
it's for the kids.:::['6-12-242']
yeah, to keep the kids off drugs.:::['6-12-243']
yeah. it's a very important issue in this month's playboy.:::['6-12-244']
i'm sure you all read about it.:::['6-12-245']
it's my joke. it's my joke.:::['6-12-246']
both: it's my joke.:::['6-12-247']
i don't think we're gonna settle this.:::['6-12-248']
no. let's have monica decide. yeah.:::['6-12-249']
hey, mon! mon, get out here!:::['6-12-250']
ross: monica? chandler: okay.:::['6-12-251']
you have to help us decide whose joke this is.:::['6-12-252']
why do i have to?:::['6-12-253', '4-7-235']
you're the only one that can be fair. yeah.:::['6-12-254']
i can't be. you're my boyfriend.:::['6-12-255']
but i'm your brother. we're family.:::['6-12-256']
that's the most important thing in the world.:::['6-12-257']
don't try to sway her.:::['6-12-258']
i'm your only chance to have a baby.:::['6-12-259']
okay, let's go. all right.:::['6-12-260']
we'll each tell you how we came up with the joke......then you decide which one of us:::['6-12-261']
is telling the truth. me.:::['6-12-262']
chandler, you go first.:::['6-12-263']
i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.:::['6-12-264']
did i meet him at christmas? can i finish my story?:::['6-12-265']
do you want me to pick you?:::['6-12-266']
see, i would never snap at you like that.:::['6-12-267']
two babies.:::['6-12-268']
continue. chandler: okay.:::['6-12-269']
steve said he had to go to the doctor. and his doctor's name is dr. mompey.:::['6-12-270']
i said, "dr. monkey?" and that is how the whole dr. monkey thing came up.:::['6-12-271']
okay, look, i study evolution.:::['6-12-273']
remember? evolution.:::['6-12-274']
monkey into man.:::['6-12-275']
plus, i'm a doctor. and......i had a monkey.:::['6-12-276']
i'm dr. monkey!:::['6-12-277']
i'm not arguing with that. monica: all right.:::['6-12-278']
i've heard enough. i've made my decision.:::['6-12-279']
chandler: oh! ross: okay, so what...? do tell.:::['6-12-280']
you are both idiots.:::['6-12-281']
the joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women.:::['6-12-282']
and doctors. and monkeys.:::['6-12-283']
you shouldn't argue over who gets credit.:::['6-12-284']
you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world.:::['6-12-285']
now, let it go.:::['6-12-286']
the joke sucks.:::['6-12-287']
it's your joke. it is not.:::['6-12-288']
oh, my god, chandler, there you are. hi.:::['6-12-289']
hey, it's phoebe and rachel.:::['6-12-290']
why don't you tell them......what you were telling me earlier about me:::['6-12-291']
not being high maintenance.:::['6-12-292']
monica is a self-sufficient, together lady.:::['6-12-293']
being with her has been like being on a vacation.:::['6-12-294']
and what may be perceived as high maintenance......is merely attention to detail......and......generosity of spirit.:::['6-12-295']
wow. you know what? that is the best fake speech i think i've ever heard.:::['6-12-296']
really? i've heard better.:::['6-12-297']
wait, he came up with that himself. tell them, chandler.:::['6-12-298']
i'm out of words. should i say it again?:::['6-12-299']
look, i am not high maintenance!:::['6-12-300']
i am not. chandler!:::['6-12-301']
you're high maintenance.:::['6-12-302']
you are on my list!:::['6-12-303']
look, i'm sorry, but you're not...:::['6-12-304']
you're not easygoing, but you're passionate.:::['6-12-305']
and that's good.:::['6-12-306']
and when you get upset about little things, i think i'm pretty good......at making you feel better about that.:::['6-12-307']
that's good too. they say you're high maintenance......but it's okay, because i like......maintaining you.:::['6-12-308']
i didn't even tell him to say that.:::['6-12-309']
monica: aw. chandler: okay.:::['6-12-310']
all right, you're off my list. i'm off the list.:::['6-12-311']
it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend.:::['6-12-313']
because i have the best boyfriend.:::['6-12-314']
you know, suddenly i find you very attractive.:::['6-12-315']
chandler: how'd the audition go?:::['6-12-316']
oh, not good. no.:::['6-12-317']
i didn't get the part. and i lost my job here, so...:::['6-12-318']
wow, that is a bad audition.:::['6-12-319']
well, how did you lose your job here?:::['6-12-320']
i had the audition......but gunther said i had to stay:::['6-12-321']
so he could get his hair dyed.:::['6-12-322']
so i went anyway, and he fired me.:::['6-12-323']
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand......and left you in charge:::['6-12-324']
when you've been here two days?:::['6-12-325']
that's not right.:::['6-12-326', '5-20-311']
what are you gonna do?:::['6-12-327', '6-1-109', '2-13-273', '5-4-109']
joey, you can't let him get away with that.:::['6-12-328']
i won't let him get away with that. i'm gonna say something to him...:::['6-12-329']
i really shouldn't say anything. no, i should say something to him!:::['6-12-330']
gunther? i want you to give joey his job back.:::['6-12-331']
that is really not fair that you have to fire him... okay.:::['6-12-332']
what? he can have his job back.:::['6-12-333']
that's right, he can have his job back.:::['6-12-334']
glad we got that all straightened out.:::['6-12-335']
rachel: there you go, joey.:::['6-12-336']
got your job back. that's great. thanks, rach.:::['6-12-337']
pretty nice, huh? now who's a pushover?:::['6-12-338']
rach, you're in my seat. i'm sorry.:::['6-12-339']
hey, i never got to hear who you'd pick to be your girlfriend.:::['6-12-340']
i'd pick you, phoebe. yeah, definitely you, pheebs.:::['6-12-341']
yeah, i kind of thought.:::['6-12-342']
it would totally be you.:::['6-12-343']
a question: if you had to pick one of the other two to go out with......who would you pick?:::['6-12-345']
no way. i'm not answering.:::['6-12-346']
no way, i'm not answering that.:::['6-12-348']
okay, rach, that's muffin and espresso, 4.50.:::['6-13-0']
ross, double latte, 2.75. chandler, coffee and a scone, 4.25.:::['6-13-1']
and, pheebs, herbal tea, 1.25.:::['6-13-2']
so all together that's 12.75.:::['6-13-3']
this coming from the man who couldn't split our $80 phone bill in half.:::['6-13-4']
hi. hi.:::['6-13-5', '6-13-288', '6-18-303', '6-19-266', '6-3-147', '6-3-340', '8-3-113', '8-3-117', '8-3-205', '8-2-28', '8-1-168', '8-11-96', '8-10-197', '8-15-69', '8-15-106', '8-17-75', '8-8-129', '9-7-65', '9-9-51', '9-9-297', '9-8-37', '9-13-78', '7-24-165', '7-9-95', '7-6-277', '7-7-23', '7-5-238', '7-12-259', '10-15-125', '5-20-194', '5-9-209', '5-3-0', '5-3-224', '5-1-101', '5-11-115', '5-17-11', '4-12-290', '4-15-256', '4-17-39', '4-5-59', '3-25-251', '3-19-5', '3-19-91', '3-2-16', '3-13-8', '3-11-96', '3-11-133', '3-1-126', '3-5-300']
how much do i owe?:::['6-13-6']
oh, that's on the house, courtesy of joey tribbiani.:::['6-13-7']
oh. great. well, tell him thanks.:::['6-13-8']
and since joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?:::['6-13-9']
well, he's not used to women being so forward......but i could check with him.:::['6-13-10']
he says it's okay.:::['6-13-11']
great. thanks. bye-bye.:::['6-13-12']
hey, joey, how come our stuff isn't free?:::['6-13-13']
it will be when you look like that in a tight skirt.:::['6-13-14']
this is great. i'm getting more dates than ever.:::['6-13-15']
wait, you're only giving away free stuff to the pretty girls?:::['6-13-16']
joey, that is so gross.:::['6-13-17']
hmm. how about a scone on the house, baby?:::['6-13-18']
i'm pretty.:::['6-13-19']
hey, does anyone have any gum? oh, i do.:::['6-13-20']

oh, you know what?:::['6-13-22', '10-16-209']

i know it's in here somewhere. you know what? i'm good. i'm good.:::['6-13-25']
what are you doing here? shouldn't you be at work?:::['6-13-27']
they said i can't work if i'm sick.:::['6-13-28']
i'm so sorry that you're sick. i'm not sick.:::['6-13-30']
i don't get sick.:::['6-13-31']
getting sick is for weaklings. it's for pansies.:::['6-13-32']
honey, no one thinks that you're a pansy.:::['6-13-33']
but we do think that you need a tissue.:::['6-13-34']
i have not been sick in over three years.:::['6-13-35']
i'm gonna grab you some tissue. i don't need a tissue. i'm fine.:::['6-13-36']
when you put a d at the end of "fine," you're not fine.:::['6-13-37']
i'm fine.:::['6-13-38', '1-4-107', '1-4-350', '9-2-254', '7-7-49', '10-2-30', '10-2-32', '5-8-291', '5-9-241', '3-1-318']
you know, it's a really hard word to say.:::['6-13-39']
chandler: yes? hi. is rachel here? i'm her sister.:::['6-13-40']
oh, my god, jill. oh, my god, rachel.:::['6-13-41']

daddy cut me off. never mind, i got it.:::['6-13-51']
and you know what i said to him?:::['6-13-52']
i said, "i'm gonna hire a lawyer, sue you and take all your money......and then i'm gonna cut you off.":::['6-13-53']
what did he say? he said he wouldn't pay for my lawyer.:::['6-13-54']
then he told me to come and learn the value of money......from the one daughter he's proud of.:::['6-13-56']
did you hear that? my dad's proud of me. my dad's proud of me. ha, ha.:::['6-13-58']
rach? oh, yeah, sorry.:::['6-13-59']
hey, honey, so, what did you do that made dad cut you off?:::['6-13-60']
okay, i bought a boat. you bought a boat?:::['6-13-61']
yeah, but it wasn't for me, it was for a friend.:::['6-13-62']
boy, did we make friends with the wrong sister.:::['6-13-63']
jill, i think this is the best thing that could've ever happened to you.:::['6-13-64']
you've needed to get out on your own anyway.:::['6-13-65']
and you know, when i did it, at first i was scared......but then look at me now.:::['6-13-66']
i am the only daughter that dad is proud of.:::['6-13-67']
okay, well, this is what you're gonna do. you're gonna get a job.:::['6-13-68']
you're gonna get an apartment. and i'll help you.:::['6-13-69']
you can stay with us. right? she can stay with us?:::['6-13-70']
of course, yeah. oh, that's so great.:::['6-13-71']
okay, i'm really gonna do this. i don't know how to thank you guys.:::['6-13-72']
aw. i like cars.:::['6-13-73']
you all finished here? yes.:::['6-13-74']
okay, here are the tips for this morning. joey: mm.:::['6-13-76']
jen gets 50, 50 for me, and joey owes $8.:::['6-13-77']
what? for all the free food you gave away.:::['6-13-78']
well, if it's free food, how come you're charging me for it?:::['6-13-79']
we don't give anything away unless it's someone's birthday.:::['6-13-80']
oh. what if they came in third in a modeling contest?:::['6-13-81']
no. oh. sorry.:::['6-13-82']
i just had the hardest day. some of these are so heavy.:::['6-13-83']
jill, how did you pay for all this? i thought your dad took your credit card.:::['6-13-84']
oh, please, i memorized those numbers when i was 15.:::['6-13-85']
but look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff i got.:::['6-13-86']
this is my "please hire me" sweater.:::['6-13-87']
and these are my "don't you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.:::['6-13-88']
i don't think charging clothes to your dad qualifies as making it on your own.:::['6-13-89']
oh, mr. scientist has to get all technical.:::['6-13-90']
i don't think rachel's gonna think it's a good idea.:::['6-13-91']
so who made her queen of the world? i would love that job.:::['6-13-92']
hey. what's going on? hey.:::['6-13-93']
jill.:::['6-13-94']
did you shop?:::['6-13-95']
they did.:::['6-13-97']
yeah, we went shopping. yeah, we went shopping. yeah.:::['6-13-98']
you went shopping?:::['6-13-99']
then you came in here and paraded it right under jill's nose......when you know she's trying to quit.:::['6-13-100']
wow. you guys, that's terrible.:::['6-13-101']
sorry, jill. sorry, jill.:::['6-13-102']
so, what did you get? oh, well, all right. i got... thank you.:::['6-13-104']
i got, um, this, you know, "i want a job" sweater.:::['6-13-105']
and then i got, uh... these are apartment pants.:::['6-13-107']
apartment pants?:::['6-13-108']
yeah, you've never heard of them?:::['6-13-109']
no, of course. of course i've heard of them.:::['6-13-110']
ross, what did you get? huh?:::['6-13-111']
i got this...:::['6-13-112']
this.:::['6-13-113']
a pashmina? yeah.:::['6-13-114']
oh, i love these babies.:::['6-13-115']
really? ross: mm-hm.:::['6-13-116']
ross, what's a pashmina?:::['6-13-117']
it's a rug.:::['6-13-118']
jill?:::['6-13-119']
i'm sorry, rachel.:::['6-13-120']
oh, come on, you really think that's gonna work on me?:::['6-13-121']
i invented that.:::['6-13-122']
oh, right. but i am sorry.:::['6-13-123']
all right, it's okay. one little setback is okay.:::['6-13-124']
but don't let it happen again, all right? okay.:::['6-13-125']
now, since daddy paid for all this stuff, i should take it all away.:::['6-13-126']
but i'm just gonna take the pashmina.:::['6-13-127']
and the pants.:::['6-13-128']
you know what? i'm just gonna take it all, because that way, you'll learn the lesson.:::['6-13-129']
alrighty.:::['6-13-130']
i'm gonna run a couple of errands, and i will see you at dinner.:::['6-13-131']
she took all my stuff.:::['6-13-132']
yeah. everything but the little blue one.:::['6-13-133']
that's the best one.:::['6-13-134']
oh, my god. thank you so much. oh. well, hey.:::['6-13-135']
oh, my gosh, that was so lame. like a pashmina could be a rug.:::['6-13-136']
oh, yeah? well, how about you with the::::['6-13-137']
shut up. i wasn't like that at all.:::['6-13-138']
what about what i said, you know, about the apartment pants?:::['6-13-139']
how dumb was i?:::['6-13-140']
were you this cute in high school?:::['6-13-141']
no, you stop. no, you stop.:::['6-13-142']
you stop.:::['6-13-143']
okay, why don't i sit here and then you'll both stop it?:::['6-13-144']
okay, so, what do you wanna do? let's do something crazy.:::['6-13-145']
i know, let's rest and drink lots of fluids.:::['6-13-146']
okay, i'll rest.:::['6-13-147']
but, you know, if i'm going to bed, then you're coming with me.:::['6-13-148']
see, that would be impossible to resist if you weren't all drippy here.:::['6-13-149']
are you saying that you don't wanna get with this?:::['6-13-150']
yeah, i don't think you should say that even when you're healthy.:::['6-13-151']
oh. come on.:::['6-13-152']
don't take this personally, okay?:::['6-13-153']
it's just that i just can't have sex with a sick person.:::['6-13-154']
i'm with you, chandler.:::['6-13-155']
i can't have sex with a sick person either. that's disgusting.:::['6-13-156']
but i'm not sick. let me prove it to you.:::['6-13-157']
we are two healthy people in the prime of life.:::['6-13-158']
see, that's the thing. i would like to stay in......the prime of life.:::['6-13-159']
hey. what's up?:::['6-13-161', '7-17-188', '10-1-4']
um, i think there's something you should maybe know.:::['6-13-162']
it better not be about the apartment pants......because i just pitched the idea to:::['6-13-163']
my boss at ralph lauren, and she loved it.:::['6-13-164']
no, no. it's just, i was, um...:::['6-13-165']
i was with ross and jill after you left......and i'm pretty sure:::['6-13-166']
i saw a little spark between them.:::['6-13-167']
what? yeah, i mean, it's probably nothing.:::['6-13-168']
but i just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.:::['6-13-169']
with ross and jill? yeah.:::['6-13-170']
with ross and my sister?:::['6-13-171']
with my sister jill and my ex-boyfriend ross?:::['6-13-173']
oh, there is no way. okay, then.:::['6-13-175']
oh, my god. i cannot believe that.:::['6-13-176']
i don't really like it when ross goes out with anyone, but my sister?:::['6-13-177']
isn't that like incest or something?:::['6-13-178']
oh, my god, and they're gonna have sex. oh, no. what if he marries her too?:::['6-13-179']
oh, this is just terrible. this is just terrible.:::['6-13-180']
and i can't stop it. i don't own ross, you know?:::['6-13-181']
and jill, she should be able to do whatever it is she wants to do.:::['6-13-182']
oh, my god, i can't believe ross is marrying my little sister.:::['6-13-183']
this is just...:::['6-13-184']
oh, my god, this is just the worst thing that could've ever happened to me.:::['6-13-185']
but great news about the apartment pants, huh?:::['6-13-186']
that'll be 3.85.:::['6-13-187']
what do you mean? yesterday you said i was too pretty to pay.:::['6-13-188']
it's just i can't, because my manager said that i...:::['6-13-189']
happy birthday to you:::['6-13-190', '6-13-191', '6-13-194', '6-13-247', '9-5-335', '9-5-336', '9-5-340', '2-16-247', '2-16-249']

oh, hey. uh...:::['6-13-198']
you know, i just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.:::['6-13-199']
oh. no. but i just walked past three sales and i didn't go in.:::['6-13-200']
how strong am i? oh.:::['6-13-201']

hey, you know who doesn't have to job-hunt?:::['6-13-203']
ross. he works at the university. yeah?:::['6-13-204']
oh, so you know that? you guys talked? so you get along? so you're gonna go out?:::['6-13-205']
me go out with ross? no. god, no. what would make you think that?:::['6-13-206']
it's just phoebe......said she, you know, thought she saw:::['6-13-207']
something between you guys.:::['6-13-208']
no. i mean, he's nice. rachel: yeah.:::['6-13-209']
he's the kind of guy you're friends with but not the kind of guy you date.:::['6-13-210']
i mean, he's the kind of guy you date, because you did, but me?:::['6-13-211']
hmm, not so much.:::['6-13-212']
oh, not so much? what do you mean?:::['6-13-213']
i mean, is there something wrong with ross?:::['6-13-214']
oh, no, no, no. he's just...:::['6-13-215']
i don't know. you know, he's just a little bookish.:::['6-13-216']
are you saying he's a geek? you think so too?:::['6-13-217']
no. no. ross is not a geek.:::['6-13-218']
fine. then let's just say he's not my type.:::['6-13-219']
what, handsome is not your type?:::['6-13-220']
smart, kind, good kisser? what, those things aren't on your list?:::['6-13-221']
ross is a great guy. you would be lucky to be with him.:::['6-13-222']
well, okay, if it means that much to you, i'll ask him out.:::['6-13-223']
oh, no, no, no. that's not what i meant. i was just...:::['6-13-224']
you know what, rachel? you're right. you know, he has been really nice to me.:::['6-13-225']
yeah, but he's not your type.:::['6-13-226']
but maybe that's a good thing.:::['6-13-227']
you know, i'm doing all these different things.:::['6-13-228']
maybe i should just try dating a geek too.:::['6-13-229']
yeah, but you don't, you know... you don't wanna try too much too fast.:::['6-13-230']
i mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl......who tried too much too fast,don't you?:::['6-13-231']
she died, jill.:::['6-13-233']
monica: chandler.:::['6-13-234', '3-17-172']

oh, so not really "never." heh.:::['6-13-260']
i have to say, you are a much bigger person than i am.:::['6-13-261']

so you wanna go, uh......mix it up?:::['6-13-282']
not now, i'm sick. oh, come on, you big faker.:::['6-13-283']

well, that was before all the vaporizing action.:::['6-13-285']
okay, if you really wanna have sex. okay.:::['6-13-286']
worked like a charm.:::['6-13-287']

and i bet you thought it would be weird. but it's not.:::['6-13-301']
so, well, i'll, um...:::['6-13-303']
i'll have her home by midnight. ha, ha.:::['6-13-304']
why aren't you home yet?:::['6-13-305']
monica: is someone there?:::['6-13-306']
oh, yeah, it's me. sorry.:::['6-13-307']
chandler: what are you doing here?:::['6-13-308']
uh, i'm just looking out your window at the view.:::['6-13-309']
what are you guys doing?:::['6-13-310', '9-7-210']
chandler: we got some vaporub in some places.:::['6-13-311']
oh. he brought her back to his apartment.:::['6-13-312']
who?:::['6-13-313', '6-18-157', '1-22-200', '1-18-33', '1-18-35', '9-23-554', '9-20-307', '2-24-2', '5-1-50', '4-7-263', '3-12-49']
is that your sister?:::['6-13-314']
ugh. she is a slut.:::['6-13-315']
god. ross is on a date with your sister. how weird is that?:::['6-13-316']
oh, my god, look, he's taking off her clothes.:::['6-13-317']
he's taking off her coat.:::['6-13-318']
rachel: oh, this is just terrible.:::['6-13-319']
oh, no, it's not. it was the first date. i'm sure that nothing is gonna...:::['6-13-320']
hoo-hoo. he's gonna get some.:::['6-13-321']
of the glare......from the streetlight:::['6-13-322']
out of his apartment.:::['6-13-323']
you know, so, um, he's closed the drapes there......so he can have a nice pleasant:::['6-13-324']
conversation with your little sister.:::['6-13-325']
well, i'm off to bed.:::['6-13-326']
hi, you guys. hey.:::['6-22-0']
well, it's just... it's one of these situations that i just hate.:::['6-22-2']
you know, a massage client gave me three tickets......to the helmut peltz exhibit:::['6-22-3']
at the morgan chase museum.:::['6-22-4']
now you're thinking you gotta sleep with him.:::['6-22-5']
no. no, it's just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us.:::['6-22-6']
i'll give up my ticket. me too.:::['6-22-7']
okay. that's so generous.:::['6-22-8']
and i think ross is generous too.:::['6-22-9']
great. okay. then it's just us girls.:::['6-22-10']
great. yeah.:::['6-22-11']
so, what is the exhibit?:::['6-22-12']
it's mostly just photographs......of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed:::['6-22-13']
with video games and free sandwiches.:::['6-22-14']
hi. group: hi. hi there.:::['6-22-16']
hey, ross, listen.:::['6-22-17', '1-12-16']
chandler got you out of going to the lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.:::['6-22-18']
thanks? but i have plans. uh, elizabeth and i are going out of town.:::['6-22-19']
oh, that's great. yeah.:::['6-22-20', '10-1-240']
think about all the money that you're gonna make.:::['6-22-21']
why? what?:::['6-22-22']
well, her father pays you for babysitting, right?:::['6-22-23']
uh-oh. ha, ha.:::['6-22-24']
no, no. that's funny. but maybe it's time to move on.:::['6-22-25']
you know, let it go. stop it.:::['6-22-26']
besides, rachel's going out with elizabeth's father.:::['6-22-27']
so, uh, he's much older than she is.:::['6-22-28']
looks like i'm not the only one interested in fossils. huh?:::['6-22-29']
ross, all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.:::['6-22-30']
uh, well, rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothings in his ear. huh?:::['6-22-32']
ross? oh, come on, that's funny, you know?:::['6-22-33']
because he's got, like, a hearing aid, you know?:::['6-22-34']
because he's all old.:::['6-22-35']
one second.:::['6-22-36', '3-19-256']
okay, look, ross.:::['6-22-37']
just so you know, since lizzie likes you so much......i accept the fact:::['6-22-38']
that you're going out with her.:::['6-22-39']
really? okay, that's great.:::['6-22-40']
yeah. but then i changed my mind.:::['6-22-41']
i'm funny like that.:::['6-22-42']
so i've told lizzie and now i'm telling you.:::['6-22-43']
i don't want you seeing my daughter anymore.:::['6-22-44']
all right, look. i realize it upsets you.:::['6-22-45']
yes, it does.:::['6-22-46']
but elizabeth and i are both adults......and so i don't think there's really:::['6-22-47']
anything you can do about it.:::['6-22-48']
i'll tell the university about your relationship and have you fired.:::['6-22-49']
oh, a man with a plan.:::['6-22-50']
this is so exciting. you get your picture back up on the wall of fame.:::['6-22-51']
i know. it was so cool when it was up there before.:::['6-22-52']
me and jim belushi would just be cracking up about something.:::['6-22-53']
then i get fired off days of our lives and he takes me down.:::['6-22-54']
now he's just laughing at me.:::['6-22-55']
look at him. that smug belushi bastard.:::['6-22-56']
oh. okay. maybe when they put your picture back up......they could put you next to matt lauer.:::['6-22-57']
look at him just smiling at me. hee-hee.:::['6-22-58']
yeah, i know. we'd be great together.:::['6-22-59']
hey. so i'm back. who are you?:::['6-22-60']
joey tribbiani.:::['6-22-61', '6-21-164', '6-4-140', '2-24-214']
from the wall?:::['6-22-62']
okay, maybe this will jog your memory, huh?:::['6-22-63']
okay, anyway.:::['6-22-65']
i'm ready to go back up on the wall. i'm the star of a new tv show.:::['6-22-66']
show me in the tv book. oh, well, it's not on tv yet.:::['6-22-67']
well, then it's not on the wall yet.:::['6-22-68']
okay, fine. i will bring you a tape. huh?:::['6-22-69']
so, um, now, do you have any of matt lauer's clothes here?:::['6-22-70']
maybe just ones that haven't been cleaned yet?:::['6-22-71']
god.:::['6-22-72', '1-12-227', '8-22-26', '9-11-290', '10-17-402', '2-24-314']
i love museums.:::['6-22-73']
soaking up all the culture. yeah.:::['6-22-74']
where do you want to start? ooh, the gift shop.:::['6-22-75']
hey, and then lunch. oh, wait, yes, but i can't eat too much.:::['6-22-77']
paul's taking me out to dinner tonight. he said he has a big surprise planned.:::['6-22-78']
ow, wow. what do you think? maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?:::['6-22-79']
what? no, why?:::['6-22-80']
no reason. that would just be a really big surprise, right?:::['6-22-81']
you could put the aisle over here and then have the wedding ceremony here.:::['6-22-82']
i didn't know you could get married here.:::['6-22-83']
this would be a beautiful place to get married.:::['6-22-84']
yeah, but i wouldn't put the aisle there. and i'd never have the ceremony there.:::['6-22-85']
you'd have the ceremony under this big, beautiful arch.:::['6-22-86']
may i help you?:::['6-22-87', '1-13-208', '8-17-159', '2-19-339']
oh, sorry. didn't mean to interrupt. it's a beautiful space.:::['6-22-88']
do you do a lot of weddings here? yes, we're very popular.:::['6-22-89']
there's a two-year waiting list. sorry.:::['6-22-90']
monica, you should totally put your name down for this place.:::['6-22-91']
what? are you crazy?:::['6-22-92']
i'm not getting married. i'm not even engaged.:::['6-22-93']
yeah, but there's a two-year wait. what if you get engaged in two years?:::['6-22-94']
then you've gotta wait another two years for this place?:::['6-22-95']
that's four years. chandler's not gonna wait that long.:::['6-22-96']
he's gonna find somebody else, you know?:::['6-22-97']
someone who put their name on the list. mm-hm.:::['6-22-98']
yeah. honey, it can't hurt to put your name down.:::['6-22-99']
if in two years you're not engaged, you just don't use it.:::['6-22-100']
well, i guess there is no harm in putting my name down.:::['6-22-101']
i'm gonna do it too. me too.:::['6-22-102']
really? who would you marry?:::['6-22-103']
i don't know. i don't have anyone right now, you know?:::['6-22-104']
oh, pheebs.:::['6-22-105', '1-16-320']
don't feel too sorry for me. at least my boyfriend isn't gay.:::['6-22-106']
phoebe, that's not... don't even get me started on yours.:::['6-22-107']
so, did you watch the tape of my show? i did.:::['6-22-109']
all right. let's get me back up there. no. you don't go up on the wall.:::['6-22-110']
what? but you saw the show. yes. it was very offensive to my people.:::['6-22-111']
dry cleaners?:::['6-22-112']
russians. it showed them as terrorists and villains.:::['6-22-113']
okay, okay. look, you got harrison ford up there.:::['6-22-114']
that's right. mr. ford is a very good customer.:::['6-22-115']
he brings us a lot of clothes. you bring us nothing.:::['6-22-116']
okay, well, that may be true.:::['6-22-117']
but in air force one, okay, the russians were terrorists and evil.:::['6-22-118']
and plus, he kills a bunch of them. that's offensive to russians.:::['6-22-119']
i've never seen it. oh, you should. it's great.:::['6-22-120']
this place is really beautiful.:::['6-22-121']
yeah. i've been coming here since i was a kid. this used to be my grandma's.:::['6-22-122']
wow. the only thing i got from my grandmother was her eyes. heh.:::['6-22-123']
i mean, not her actual eyeballs.:::['6-22-124']
but people say that my eyes look...:::['6-22-125']
do you want to make out? sure. ha, ha.:::['6-22-126']
are you okay?:::['6-22-127', '6-21-143', '1-16-160', '1-7-52', '1-12-217', '8-1-140', '8-24-114', '7-7-55', '10-15-155', '2-12-115', '5-24-235', '5-9-240', '5-14-78']
what's wrong? uh...:::['6-22-128']
yeah, i was just thinking about your father.:::['6-22-129']
well, whatever works for you. no.:::['6-22-130']
no, no. uh, he just really freaked me out before.:::['6-22-131']
well, so we have to hide our relationship from one more person.:::['6-22-133']
big deal. besides, we've had fun hiding it.:::['6-22-134']
hey. yeah.:::['6-22-136']
um, you brought protection, right?:::['6-22-137']
why? are there, like, bears or something?:::['6-22-138']
no. oh, uh...:::['6-22-139']
oh, protection, yeah. no. that i forgot.:::['6-22-140']
ha, ha. i'll just run to the store and get some.:::['6-22-141']
no. hey, hey. i'm the guy. i'll get it.:::['6-22-142']

oh, it's cool. i was gonna fire you anyway. great.:::['6-22-335']
can you help me pick an engagement ring for monica?:::['6-23-0']
i can't figure this out. it's so hard.:::['6-23-1']
should i get her a tiffany cut, or a princess cut or a...:::['6-23-2']
ow! paper cut!:::['6-23-3']
have you told anyone else?:::['6-23-4']
no, i don't want to tell anybody. i don't want monica to find out.:::['6-23-5']
you told me.:::['6-23-6']
well, that's because i trust you, and we're best friends......and you walked in on me:::['6-23-7']
while i was looking at ring brochures.:::['6-23-8']
well, once again, not knocking pays off.:::['6-23-9']
i only wish you hadn't been on the toilet. me too.:::['6-23-10']
joey: hey. both: hey.:::['6-23-11']
chandler, wanna go to the coffeehouse? oh, all right.:::['6-23-12']
oh, perfect. we were just gonna see if you wanted to go.:::['6-23-13']
oh, well, we don't, because we got the other place.:::['6-23-14']
how rude.:::['6-23-15']
oh, i'm sorry. you want a bite?:::['6-23-16']
so how are things going with paul?:::['6-23-17']
good. huh.:::['6-23-18']
although, you know, he's a private guy. mm-hm.:::['6-23-19']
you know, i wish i could get him to open up a bit. share some feelings.:::['6-23-20']
that's easy. you just have to think of him as a jar of pickles that won't open.:::['6-23-21']
so, what are you saying?:::['6-23-22', '2-18-222']
i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?:::['6-23-23']
no, that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.:::['6-23-24']
paul: hi. hi.:::['6-23-25']
paul: how are you? watch this.:::['6-23-26']
hey, paul. hi, phoebe.:::['6-23-27']
so how are things going with you?:::['6-23-28']
can't complain.:::['6-23-29']
hey! hi.:::['6-23-30']
great to... ross, good to see you too.:::['6-23-31']
good. bye. you take care.:::['6-23-32']
hey, pheebs, what was the deal with you and chandler blowing us off before?:::['6-23-33']
ah, that was so weird, huh?:::['6-23-34']
phoebe, why did you do it?:::['6-23-35']
i didn't do it. it was chandler.:::['6-23-36']
he's... he's mad at you.:::['6-23-37']
what? why? oh, please. i think you know why.:::['6-23-38']
i can't think of anything.:::['6-23-39']
come on, ross. you're a paleontologist. dig a little deeper.:::['6-23-40']
wait a minute, is it because joey and i didn't invite him to that knicks game......a couple weeks ago?:::['6-23-41']
do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?:::['6-23-42']
i guess it could. well, then i think that's it.:::['6-23-43']
well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up.:::['6-23-44']
i wish he'd just tell me the truth.:::['6-23-45']
well, if that's what you want......then you should run him under hot water:::['6-23-46']
and bang his head against the table.:::['6-23-47']
honey, i made a reservation at china garden. is that okay?:::['6-23-48']
yeah, that's great.:::['6-23-49']
but first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. tell me about your day.:::['6-23-50']
it was fine.:::['6-23-51']
hey, what are you thinking? what are you thinking right now?:::['6-23-53']
that you are looking really fine in that dress.:::['6-23-54']
yeah, that's great, paul. but, you know...:::['6-23-55']
i want to know what... wow, those are really great.:::['6-23-56']
i just want to know......what is behind this strong,silent exterior?:::['6-23-57']
you know, they say that still waters run deep......and i want to swim in yours.:::['6-23-58']
are you talking about having sex?:::['6-23-59']
no, paul.:::['6-23-60']
i don't know anything about you.:::['6-23-61']
you know, like your childhood. tell me about your childhood.:::['6-23-62']
normal.:::['6-23-63']
okay, well, then how about puberty? come on. that's always a painful time.:::['6-23-64']
you know, your friends invite you to a slumber party......and stick your hand in warm water......while you're sleeping:::['6-23-65']
so that you pee in your sleeping bag.:::['6-23-66']
no, that never happened to me.:::['6-23-67']
well, you're lucky you never met that bitch, sharon majeski.:::['6-23-68']
the rest of your life, you know. any regrets?:::['6-23-70']
all right, paul. i'm not asking for a lot here.:::['6-23-72']
just give me something. anything.:::['6-23-73']
when i was 6 years old... mm-hm.:::['6-23-75']
...i wanted a big wheel.:::['6-23-76']
and instead, my parents got me this little......plastic chicken:::['6-23-77']
that you hop around on.:::['6-23-78']
it was embarrassing. kids made fun of me.:::['6-23-79']
that was a pretty tough year.:::['6-23-80']
that's great. see? heh.:::['6-23-81']
i already feel like i know you a little better. thank you.:::['6-23-82']
okay, come on. now we can go eat. let's go.:::['6-23-83']
it was horrible.:::['6-23-84']
they called me "chicken boy.":::['6-23-85']
in fifth grade, i got in a fight. well, it wasn't really a fight.:::['6-23-86']
richard danville bit me on the nose.:::['6-23-87']
i fell down, still have a little scar right here. you can see it.:::['6-23-88']
yeah, yeah. i see the scar.:::['6-23-89']
listen, paul, i think this is really great that, you know, you've shared your feelings.:::['6-23-90']
it's really... it's beautiful.:::['6-23-91']
but, um, what do you say we go share some food?:::['6-23-92']
no, i couldn't eat now.:::['6-23-93']
what are you talking about? you love their kung pao chicken.:::['6-23-94']
chicken?:::['6-23-95', '7-21-123', '5-2-12']
chicken boy! i'm sorry. i didn't mean to do that.:::['6-23-96']
well, this is the nine millionth ring store we've been to......and i can't find the perfect ring.:::['6-23-97']
ugly ring, ugly ring, ugly ring...:::['6-23-98']
it's a beautiful selection.:::['6-23-99']
okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring.:::['6-23-100']
maybe you do something different, you know?:::['6-23-101']
maybe you get her an engagement bracelet. or an engagement tiara.:::['6-23-102']
ooh! an engagement revolutionary war musket.:::['6-23-103']
you know, i'm so glad i picked you to help me with this.:::['6-23-104']
huh? uh-huh.:::['6-23-105']
can't you imagine getting down on one knee......and handing her this gorgeous:::['6-23-106']
piece of weaponry?:::['6-23-107']
yeah, i'm gonna stick with the ring.:::['6-23-108']
oh, this one's nice. i like it this one.:::['6-23-109']
sir? kind sir, can i see this one?:::['6-23-110']
wait a minute. this is the reason you brought me, okay?:::['6-23-111']
i know how to haggle. so let me handle this from here on out.:::['6-23-112']
yes, i would like to see that ring, please. or not. whatever.:::['6-23-114']
this ring is from the 1920s.:::['6-23-115']
it's a one-and-a-half karat diamond with sapphires on either side.:::['6-23-116']
sir, could i ask you to, um?:::['6-23-117']
could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?:::['6-23-118']
okay. chandler: okay.:::['6-23-119']
will you marry me?:::['6-23-120', '6-24-47', '1-16-297', '7-21-98', '7-21-265', '5-15-241']
oh, my god, that's it. that's the ring.:::['6-23-121']
how much is it? chandler, i will handle this.:::['6-23-122']
how much is it?:::['6-23-123']
eight thousand six hundred.:::['6-23-124']
we will give you $10.:::['6-23-125']
are you interested in this ring? yes. yes.:::['6-23-126']
but i can only pay $8000.:::['6-23-127']
okay. i can let it go for 8. we stand firm at $10.:::['6-23-128']
how would you like to pay? uh, credit card.:::['6-23-129']
oh, no. no, no, but i lent my credit card to joey.:::['6-23-130']
okay, i'll go get it. you guard the ring. phoebe: okay.:::['6-23-131']
listen, i'm sorry about before.:::['6-23-132']
do you have anything here for $10?:::['6-23-133']
uh, yes. i have these two rather beautiful......five-dollar bills.:::['6-23-134']
i'll give you $1 for them.:::['6-23-135']
hey, remember how chandler and phoebe blew us off yesterday?:::['6-23-136']
remember, you were eating pizza? yeah.:::['6-23-138']
well, apparently chandler's angry at us......for not getting him a ticket:::['6-23-139']
to that knicks game a couple weeks ago.:::['6-23-140']
what, we were supposed to just get him a ticket?:::['6-23-141']
that guy is always mooching off of us. yeah.:::['6-23-142']
anyway, i still think we should try to patch things up, you know?:::['6-23-143']
like, maybe we could get him tickets to another knicks game and invite him.:::['6-23-144']
wow, that's a great idea. and i still have his credit card.:::['6-23-145']
here you go.:::['6-23-146', '1-12-220', '9-6-41', '7-3-319', '7-10-129', '10-8-295', '2-6-35', '2-4-253']
hey, hey. i got this one. here you go.:::['6-23-147']
you know, i gotta tell you, sometimes i just don't get chandler.:::['6-23-148']
you know, me and him do stuff all the time without you......and you don't get all upset.:::['6-23-149']
all the time? all the time.:::['6-23-150']
oh, my god! oh, my god!:::['6-23-151']
still crying? like a little girl.:::['6-23-152']
i know, i know, i know. this is all my fault.:::['6-23-153']
i wanted him to open up.:::['6-23-154']
but god, i didn't know that i was gonna unleash......this weepy, clingy, moist monster.:::['6-23-155']
you know, i only know of two sure-fire ways to shut a man up.:::['6-23-156']
and one of them is sex.:::['6-23-157']
what's the other? i don't know.:::['6-23-158']
i never had to use the other one.:::['6-23-159']
i'm just saying, you know, if we're having sex, he's not talking.:::['6-23-160']
ah, that's right. you're the talker.:::['6-23-161']
anyway, uh, great idea. yeah.:::['6-23-162']
um, i gotta go to the store. i told him that i would buy him some more tissues.:::['6-23-163']
uh, we have some here. no, you don't.:::['6-23-164']
okay. um, i'd also like to try on the tiara.:::['6-23-165']
oh, yeah. okay.:::['6-23-166', '9-2-169']
wow, what do you think? too much?:::['6-23-167']
a tad.:::['6-23-168']
then take the tiara back......and let me hold the musket again.:::['6-23-169']
something's missing.:::['6-23-170']
let me see the ring that my friend picked out.:::['6-23-171']
where's the 1920s princess-cut ring?:::['6-23-172']
i just sold it to that gentleman.:::['6-23-173']
wait, no!:::['6-23-175']
let me out! now!:::['6-23-176']
rachel?:::['6-23-177', '1-1-56', '1-4-78', '8-16-4', '8-16-21', '8-16-22', '9-16-232', '10-14-246', '2-8-261', '2-18-247']
how are you, paul? okay.:::['6-23-179']
chandler......did your dad ever hug you?:::['6-23-180']
no. did he hug you?:::['6-23-181']
it's just that my dad never did.:::['6-23-183']
i miss my dad.:::['6-23-184']
well, you can see my dad in vegas kissing other dads.:::['6-23-185']
hey, chandler? yeah?:::['6-23-186']
would you?:::['6-23-187']
would you hug me?:::['6-23-188']
i'm a little busy here, paul. that's exactly what my dad used to say.:::['6-23-189']
okay. a quick one. come on, hug it out.:::['6-23-190']
there you go.:::['6-23-192', '6-18-294', '1-3-265', '1-15-195', '1-15-341', '1-7-45', '8-1-245', '8-22-94', '9-17-126', '7-8-21', '10-9-54', '2-23-169', '2-21-144', '4-18-135', '3-5-343']
five more seconds... okay.:::['6-23-194']
joey! what? hey, what...?:::['6-23-195']
hi. paul, is it?:::['6-23-196']
do you have my credit card? yeah. it's in my...:::['6-23-197']
in my pocket.:::['6-23-198']
my back pocket. back pocket. thank god.:::['6-23-199']
listen, i got tickets to the knicks tonight. i can't go.:::['6-23-200']
come on, it'll be fun.:::['6-23-201', '8-6-4']
me, you, ross and... paul, probably.:::['6-23-202']
chandler, i found the perfect ring.:::['6-23-203']
oh, that's pretty nice, but i'm gonna go with the one i picked first.:::['6-23-204']
oh, wake up, chandler. the one you picked is gone. it's over.:::['6-23-205']
some guy bought it. i'm sorry. i tried to stop him but they put me in jail.:::['6-23-207']
they put you in jail? the little jail between the doors!:::['6-23-208']
phoebe, i asked you to guard the ring. phoebe: i know. i'm sorry.:::['6-23-209']
but, you know, this ring is better. and monica never even saw the other ring.:::['6-23-210']
yeah. but when he proposed to me with the ring, i got goose bumps.:::['6-23-211']
maybe it was the guy. it was the ring.:::['6-23-212']
hey, so was he excited about the tickets? no. he blew us off.:::['6-23-213']
what? i know.:::['6-23-214']
i can't believe it.:::['6-23-215', '1-11-177', '7-12-270', '5-14-41']
can i tell you something?:::['6-23-216', '6-23-218']
i'm a little mad at him now.:::['6-23-217']
you know what? he didn't want to talk to us about being angry?:::['6-23-220']
well, maybe we don't talk to him at all.:::['6-23-221']
ooh.:::['6-23-222', '6-24-248', '6-2-272', '9-15-142', '9-14-227', '7-15-276', '10-1-171', '10-1-204', '10-10-207', '2-8-91', '2-21-117', '5-23-116', '5-8-280', '5-3-83', '4-8-28', '4-3-222', '3-4-12']
freeze him out. that's right.:::['6-23-223']
i like it. ah? we'll show him.:::['6-23-224']
from now on, it's gonna be joey and ross, best friends.:::['6-23-225']
okay, we're gonna be the new joey and chandler. ha, ha.:::['6-23-226']
hi, i'm back.:::['6-23-227', '6-18-107']
there's more to tell you. i've written it all down.:::['6-23-228']
oh, that's great.:::['6-23-229', '6-2-15', '4-9-54']
no, actually, that's...:::['6-23-230']
that's great. that's really great.:::['6-23-231']
you know, i gotta tell you, writing, all that writing, it gets me, uh...:::['6-23-232']
it gets me kind of hot.:::['6-23-233']
wait, wait. listen to this::::['6-23-234']
know what i wanted to be when i was that age?:::['6-23-235']
a lover?:::['6-23-236']
a surfer. oh, yeah. a surfer?:::['6-23-237']
i wanted to be one with the waves... honey, hold on real quick.:::['6-23-238']
hold on a second. let me just get a little more comfortable here.:::['6-23-239']
this isn't too revealing, is it? no.:::['6-23-241']
whatever happened to that little dude?:::['6-23-242']
so full of dreams.:::['6-23-243']
i don't care about the little dude.:::['6-23-244']
i can't. i cannot listen to any more of this.:::['6-23-245']
the only one who'd listen to this is a mental health professional.:::['6-23-246']
and that's only because they get paid $100 an hour.:::['6-23-247']
do you know how much money i could've made listening to you?:::['6-23-248']
two thousand dollars.:::['6-23-249']
and you know when i figured that out? while you were talking.:::['6-23-250']
i can't believe you're trying to stifle me, when just 14 hours ago......we figured out that that's exactly:::['6-23-251']
what my mother was trying to do to me.:::['6-23-252']
i don't mean... i didn't mean to stifle you.:::['6-23-254']
this is all just a little overwhelming.:::['6-23-255']
oh, rachel.:::['6-23-256']
i didn't mean to overwhelm you.:::['6-23-258']
it's just that when those gates open......it's hard to close them.:::['6-23-259']
but they are closed now. believe me.:::['6-23-260']
i'm so glad. i'm so glad you shared.:::['6-23-261']
and i'm glad that you're done.:::['6-23-262']
so, what do you say we, um...:::['6-23-263']
i'd really like that. mm-hm.:::['6-23-264']
that was so good.:::['6-23-265']
oh, oh, ugh.:::['6-23-266']
hey. i can't believe you talked me into......buying this stupid:::['6-23-267']
gumball-machine-looking ring.:::['6-23-268']
it's not a stupid gumball-machine-looking ring. it's a beautiful ring.:::['6-23-269']
when i looked at the other ring......i could see monica's face:::['6-23-271']
when i gave it to her......and i could see her saying yes.:::['6-23-272']
when i look at this ring, all i see is a ring.:::['6-23-273']
unless i look at it really closely, and then i can see my own eye.:::['6-23-274']
look, this is the most important thing i'm gonna do in my life.:::['6-23-275']
i want to make sure it's perfect.:::['6-23-276']
okay. there may be a way that we could get the other ring back.:::['6-23-277']
because i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was gonna propose.:::['6-23-278']
so maybe we could get him to trade rings or something.:::['6-23-279']
i can't do that.:::['6-23-280', '9-9-223', '7-21-26']
well, you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.:::['6-23-281']
there he is.:::['6-23-282']
okay, and he hasn't proposed yet. she has no ring on her finger.:::['6-23-283']
wow, you're good. after this, we should solve crimes.:::['6-23-284']
yeah. okay. go get him.:::['6-23-285']
excuse me, sir. could you come with me, please? you have a phone call.:::['6-23-287']
who is it? it is your office.:::['6-23-288']
do you know who at my office? john.:::['6-23-289']
oh, john. great.:::['6-23-290']
there he is. hi. hi. okay.:::['6-23-291']
okay, there was a mix-up at the jewelry store.:::['6-23-292']
the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me.:::['6-23-293']
so i'm gonna need to have that back.:::['6-23-294']
but in exchange, i'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring.:::['6-23-295']
wow, i would trade.:::['6-23-296']
it is beautiful, but i'm gonna use this one. now, if you'll excuse me.:::['6-23-297']
no, no. see, this is my fiancée, and her heart was set on that ring.:::['6-23-298']
you don't want to break her heart now, do you?:::['6-23-299']
yeah. do you want to break a dying woman's heart?:::['6-23-300']
you're dying?:::['6-23-301']
yeah, she's dying......of a cough, apparently.:::['6-23-302']
it's my dying wish to have that ring. see, if i'm not buried with that ring......then my spirit will wander:::['6-23-303']
the netherworld...:::['6-23-304']
okay, that's enough, honey.:::['6-23-305']
oh, i don't know.:::['6-23-306', '1-19-37', '5-1-304', '4-23-111', '3-6-106']
let me see the ring. great. okay, here.:::['6-23-307']
all right, i'll do it. thank you. thank you. thank you.:::['6-23-308']
and you are about to marry a wonderful man.:::['6-23-309']
hey, i'm marrying a dead woman.:::['6-23-310']
guys?:::['6-23-311', '6-23-314', '6-23-343', '7-3-142', '7-17-299']
i got something important to tell you.:::['6-23-312']
guys.:::['6-23-313']
i'm gonna ask monica to marry me.:::['6-23-315', '6-23-330']
i think we gotta end the freeze-out.:::['6-23-316']
wait a minute. is this for real?:::['6-23-317']
yeah. check out the ring.:::['6-23-318']
so you two are really serious?:::['6-23-320']
yeah, pretty much.:::['6-23-321']

she walked in while i was looking at ring brochures.:::['6-23-341']
you can understand that, right?:::['6-23-342']
okay, chandler. okay.:::['6-21-0']

"on the 5th, a special someone is going to give you a gift.":::['6-21-2']
oh, well, thank you in advance. mm. ha, ha.:::['6-21-3']
"but the 12th brings a lover's spat.":::['6-21-4']

oh, wait. "on the 19th, a secret crush announces itself.":::['6-21-7']
hey, guys. hey.:::['6-21-8', '8-10-47', '4-20-25']

i've dreamed about this for years.:::['6-21-13']
why have i not been preparing?:::['6-21-14']
no, joey, you're gonna be great.:::['6-21-15']
but i gotta act with a robot. i don't know anything about technology.:::['6-21-16']
i can't even use chandler's computer, except to find porn.:::['6-21-17']
and that's only because it's there when you turn it on.:::['6-21-18']
our lover's spat will start a little early this month.:::['6-21-19']
i'll be waiting.:::['6-21-20']
are you judging them by their covers? because you're really not supposed to.:::['6-21-21']
i'm deciding which one to use. i'm going to start writing another book.:::['6-21-22']
because the last one was such a big seller?:::['6-21-23']
well, if you must know, i have written 14 books.:::['6-21-24']
and as i'm the only one who has read them......i can tell you that:::['6-21-25']
they have all been very well received.:::['6-21-26']

this is the temporary robot, right? no. why?:::['6-21-53']
well, i just thought it was gonna be a really cool robot.:::['6-21-54']
like the terminator, or, uh, when i first saw you.:::['6-21-55']
i spent two years developing this machine. it's absolutely state of the art.:::['6-21-56']
i'm sorry. it doesn't look like it can do anything.:::['6-21-57']
it can do this.:::['6-21-58']
hey... oh, ha, ha.:::['6-21-59']
this is my father, paul stevens. dad, this is ross geller.:::['6-21-60']
it's great to meet you, paul.:::['6-21-61']
i prefer that liz's boyfriends to address me as mr. stevens.:::['6-21-62']
uh, of course. mr. stevens.:::['6-21-63']
good. so, ross......what's your problem?:::['6-21-64']
excuse me?:::['6-21-65', '6-5-297', '1-21-161', '1-17-92', '1-16-84', '1-4-12', '1-4-294', '1-13-69', '8-3-220', '9-22-157', '9-3-110', '9-7-178', '9-4-61', '9-11-74', '9-11-124', '7-17-32', '10-7-146', '10-14-326', '2-22-56', '5-12-250', '4-23-260', '3-21-136']
why can't you get a girlfriend your own age?:::['6-21-66']
heh. it's funny...:::['6-21-67']
um, it's not funny.:::['6-21-68']
i don't like you going out with my daughter, ross.:::['6-21-69']
okay, um, i can see that.:::['6-21-70']
but i think if you give me, um, one chance, i can change your mind.:::['6-21-71']
okay. what?:::['6-21-72', '8-21-265']
okay. i'll give you one chance to change my mind.:::['6-21-73']
you've got one minute.:::['6-21-74']
daddy. fine.:::['6-21-75']
two minutes. go.:::['6-21-76']
a minute and 50 seconds.:::['6-21-77']
okay, um...:::['6-21-78', '8-14-3', '8-18-176', '2-15-203', '5-19-269', '4-9-274', '3-25-150']
i want you to know, i have never done anything like this before.:::['6-21-79']
i mean, i've been in, um, relationships in general.:::['6-21-80']
but i've never done it with a student. i mean, not...:::['6-21-81']
not "it." we haven't done "it.":::['6-21-82']
uh... we, i mean... i mean, we've done stuff...:::['6-21-83']
okay. okay. a joke. a joke. lighten the mood.:::['6-21-84']
um, two guys go into a bar. one of them is irish.:::['6-21-85']
i'm irish. and the irish guy wins the joke.:::['6-21-86']
ross? ross!:::['6-21-87']
how crazy that we would run into you. oh, my god! thank you.:::['6-21-88']
um, uh...:::['6-21-89']
mr. stevens, i'd like you to meet my friends.:::['6-21-90']
this is phoebe, monica, and chandler.:::['6-21-91']
so you're elizabeth's father, huh? i can see now where she gets her......rugged handsomeness.:::['6-21-92']
is there a mrs. stevens?:::['6-21-93']
there's a mr. bing!:::['6-21-94']
no, unfortunately, lizzie's mom passed away shortly after she was born.:::['6-21-95']
i raised her by myself. both: oh...:::['6-21-96']
i get that a lot.:::['6-21-97']
okay, um, why don't we all take a seat, you know? heh.:::['6-21-98']
and, uh, i'll get us all some, uh, coffees.:::['6-21-99']
yeah, why don't you... ahem. uh...:::['6-21-100']
and you guys can talk about whatever you want.:::['6-21-101']
whatever pops into your head.:::['6-21-102']
it is so strange seeing ross here, this time of day......because usually:::['6-21-103']
he's at the children's hospital.:::['6-21-104']
yeah. but not looking for dates.:::['6-21-105']
so, um, monica is ross' sister.:::['6-21-106']
he's a great brother!:::['6-21-107']
i had a sister. oh.:::['6-21-108']
she passed away. all: oh...:::['6-21-109']
you don't have to do that every time.:::['6-21-110']
but, uh, ross is a great guy. i was roommates with him in college.:::['6-21-111']
funny story, heh, ha, ha...:::['6-21-112']
your roommate in college died, didn't he?:::['6-21-113']
a part of him did, yes.:::['6-21-114']
okay! here we are, paul, elizabeth.:::['6-21-115']
i hope you guys were finding something to talk about.:::['6-21-116']
yes. we were just... sorry i'm late.:::['6-21-117']
but i am ready, ready to talk you up. heh.:::['6-21-118']
when does liz's father get here? i'm already here.:::['6-21-119']
oh, ross is so great.:::['6-21-120']
honey, you got the kind with the little girl. you said we'd get the kind with the baby.:::['6-21-121']
you said the baby creeps you out. the little girl creeps me out.:::['6-21-122']
you said the baby. why would the baby creep me out?:::['6-21-123']
why would the little girl creep you out?:::['6-21-124']
i'm sorry. can you please talk a little slower.:::['6-21-125']
this is for your book? it's about relationships.:::['6-21-126']
you know, the traps, the pitfalls, what not to do.:::['6-21-127']
keep going. this stuff's great. what?:::['6-21-128']
excuse me.:::['6-21-129', '6-21-163', '6-24-231', '6-19-134', '1-18-254', '1-17-210', '1-14-115', '1-4-192', '1-13-61', '9-16-133', '7-6-325', '7-10-117', '10-5-134', '10-1-246', '10-11-241', '4-12-170', '3-22-145', '3-2-362']
and how none of it matters when the people really love each other.:::['6-21-130']
and how people will believe anything you tell them as long as it's a compliment.:::['6-21-131']
oh, hi! hi. hi. hi.:::['6-21-132']
i left my keys here somewhere. oh, well, let's look for them.:::['6-21-133']
under here... oh, hey!:::['6-21-134']
hey! are these them?:::['6-21-135']
all right. oh.:::['6-21-137']
here they are. good.:::['6-21-138']
thanks for your help. wait! sorry!:::['6-21-139']
mr. paul? just call me paul.:::['6-21-140']
paul. um, i just wanted you to know that......you know, ross really is a great guy.:::['6-21-141']
maybe you could date him then. it would save me the trouble of killing him.:::['6-21-142']
you just don't look old enough to have a 20-year-old daughter.:::['6-21-144']
well, we were very young when we had her.:::['6-21-145']
ah. we? yeah, it usually takes two people to...:::['6-21-146']
oh, no! yes! of course. i know that.:::['6-21-147']
what i meant was are you still "we" or are you just you?:::['6-21-148']
i'm just me. yeah.:::['6-21-149']
my wife died shortly after lizzie was born.:::['6-21-150']
so you raised her all on your own? yes, i did.:::['6-21-152']
how was your first day? great.:::['6-21-155']
except i got a little attitude from the robot.:::['6-21-156']
damn those robots. they're supposed to be our faithful servants!:::['6-21-157']
it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him.:::['6-21-158']
he doesn't like me. he had c.h.e.e.s.e. knock over the sandwich table......right when i was reaching for one. ugh.:::['6-21-159']
why don't you get him fired?:::['6-21-160']
i may have to. i hate to do it. but i'm the star, you know?:::['6-21-161']
there's a limit to how many sandwiches i can eat off the floor.:::['6-21-162']
joe! i'm glad i found you! i got an audition for you.:::['6-21-165']
joey: wow. the thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.:::['6-21-166']
the actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.:::['6-21-167']
it's the lead in a series.:::['6-21-168']
mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['6-21-169']
i'm the lead in mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['6-21-170']
uh-oh.:::['6-21-171', '1-15-138', '1-11-121', '1-4-151', '9-13-85', '7-22-139', '10-9-314', '2-19-133', '2-20-299', '3-14-66', '3-15-33', '3-16-193']
joey?:::['6-21-172', '6-21-175', '6-20-266', '8-16-254', '8-24-266', '9-20-27', '9-4-255', '9-12-19', '7-7-281', '7-13-77', '10-7-263', '10-1-100', '5-19-218', '5-24-133', '3-14-67']
hi, ross.:::['6-21-173']
i was just getting him to like you.:::['6-21-174']
joey! hey, ross.:::['6-21-176']
ross, joey is not here.:::['6-21-177']
okay, i'll just wait for him in here!:::['6-21-178']
ross, it's okay. you can come out.:::['6-21-179']
yeah, ross. it's okay. it's me......mr. stevens.:::['6-21-180']
oh, i didn't... oh, my gosh. i didn't even see you.:::['6-21-181']
sure you did. you came in, got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.:::['6-21-182']
you were shouting, "joey, joey!":::['6-21-183']
bye, rachel. bye.:::['6-21-184']
i'll call you later. okay. see you!:::['6-21-185']
bye, ross. ah, hoo. ha, ha.:::['6-21-186']
what? what the...? how did...? what?:::['6-21-187']
you know, he lost his keys. so he was looking for them.:::['6-21-188']
in your mouth?:::['6-21-189']
downstairs. and we got to talking......for two hours. i really liked him.:::['6-21-191']
i invited him for a cup of coffee.:::['6-21-192']
you were at the coffee house!:::['6-21-193']
ross, what's the big deal? so i kissed the guy.:::['6-21-194']
he's my girlfriend's father. okay? it's weird!:::['6-21-195']
you dated my sister. that was different!:::['6-21-196']
what? why? this is weird for me!:::['6-21-197']
ross, look. this is good for you, okay?:::['6-21-198']
let's face it. so far the guy's not loving you.:::['6-21-199']
but i can turn that around. i've got the inside track.:::['6-21-200']
we could all go out to dinner. and i could talk you up.:::['6-21-201']
plus the guy is a very, very successful lawyer.:::['6-21-202']
how is that important? oh, it's important.:::['6-21-203']
there's a million guys out there who can play mac......and there's only one robot.:::['6-21-204']
and this one guy who controls it. i didn't know he could get me fired.:::['6-21-205']
what am i gonna do? well, joey.:::['6-21-206']
you're a pretty charming guy.:::['6-21-207']
thanks. but i have a problem to deal with.:::['6-21-208']
no, sweetie. you've got to win over the guy who controls c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['6-21-209']
go back there and kiss some serious robot ass!:::['6-21-210']
that's not a bad idea!:::['6-21-211']
if i have to turn on the charm tomorrow, i'm not wasting any of it on you guys.:::['6-21-212']
oh, actually i got a little bit saved for you, pheebs.:::['6-21-213']
so do you think, uh, joey is more charming than me?:::['6-21-214']
yeah. that's why i'm sleeping with him on the side.:::['6-21-215']
yeah, you wish.:::['6-21-216', '1-10-33']
"you wish." phoebe, stop writing about us.:::['6-21-217']
i'm not writing about you. i'm writing about other people.:::['6-21-218']
who? marsha and chester.:::['6-21-219']
okay, fine. fine. then you know what? i will just write about phyllis.:::['6-21-220']
hmm. chandler: huh.:::['6-21-221']
"phyllis is sitting in the chair." i see what you're doing.:::['6-21-222']
"phyllis sees what i'm doing." oh, ho.:::['6-21-223']
ooh, i have tasted my own medicine and it is bitter.:::['6-21-224']
morning! hey!:::['6-21-225']
how's my favorite genius and his robot buddy?:::['6-21-226']
don't touch him! okay. all right. um...:::['6-21-227']
wayne, level with me. i keep hearing all these rumors that i might get fired.:::['6-21-228']
they even have actors coming in to read for my part.:::['6-21-229']
come on, man. you gotta give me a second chance.:::['6-21-230']
i love this little guy... aah.:::['6-21-231']
okay. that's why you didn't want me to touch him, right? there you go.:::['6-21-232']
stupid! i can't believe this! god.:::['6-21-233']
hey, how are you doing?:::['6-21-234']
so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up.:::['6-21-235']
so ross selflessly offered to take me.:::['6-21-236']
what a nice story. heh.:::['6-21-237']
so ross was in college......and decided to jump at the chance:::['6-21-238']
to take a young girl to her prom.:::['6-21-239']
wow. i definitely did not see that one backfiring.:::['6-21-240']
i'm gonna go to the bathroom. yeah. take your time.:::['6-21-241']
just so you know, i was a freshman and she was a senior. so it wasn't as bad as...:::['6-21-242']
ross, look. i know i've been giving you a lot of jabs.:::['6-21-243']
it's partly because i'm very protective of lizzie......and partly because:::['6-21-244']
they just keep coming to me.:::['6-21-245']
i have to admit that after all the wonderful things lizzie has told me......and the many, many, many:::['6-21-246']
stories that rachel has told me......that, well......you're not......all bad.:::['6-21-247']
"not all bad.":::['6-21-248']
i'm sorry i was so harsh. but you have to understand.:::['6-21-249']
i still look at lizzie like she's a 12-year-old girl.:::['6-21-250']
you know, i know what you mean. i do that, too.:::['6-21-251']
i beg your pardon? no! i don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.:::['6-21-252']
i mean, i have a son who's, um, 6, and i still think of him as a baby.:::['6-21-253']
you have a son? yeah. my ex-wife and i......uh, share custody of ben. and, uh...:::['6-21-254']
just so you know, carol and i are on excellent terms......as i'm sure you are with your wife.:::['6-21-255']
oh! i'm sorry.:::['6-21-256']
it's unbelievable!:::['6-21-257', '8-14-37']
don't worry. i just didn't realize you were married.:::['6-21-258']
oh, we were. but that was just a...:::['6-21-259']
i mean, that was just a big drunken mistake.:::['6-21-260']
you're back.:::['6-21-261']
you two were married?:::['6-21-262']
oh, whoops. i'm sorry. you were talking about emily.:::['6-21-263']
we said we would meet at the coffee house at 6:00.:::['6-21-264']
we said 7:00. we said 6:00!:::['6-21-265']
the only way that i said 6:00......would be if i said the sentence,"let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00.":::['6-21-266']
if i had said 7:00, i would have said something like::::['6-21-267']
"wow, my boyfriend is such a wiseass. 7:00!":::['6-21-268']
hi! oh, my good god!:::['6-21-269']
i know what time you said. what?:::['6-21-270']
well, actually i know what time chester and marsha said.:::['6-21-271']
what time? quite an interesting turn of events.:::['6-21-272']
suddenly it's my book to the rescue, huh? let's see.:::['6-21-273']
ooh. very interesting.:::['6-21-274']
yeah, well this certainly clears things up.:::['6-21-275']
what does it say? i will tell you......as soon as you thank me:::['6-21-276']
for writing my book.:::['6-21-277']
thank you for writing your book. it's a great book......and you are the queen of everything.:::['6-21-278']
thanks. so are you.:::['6-21-279']
i told you i should not wear this color.:::['6-21-280']
"monica... marsha and chester are planning on seeing a movie sunday night.:::['6-21-281']
"marsha thinks they're supposed to meet at 6:00.:::['6-21-282']
chester thinks it's at 7:00.":::['6-21-283']
you knew we would miss the movie? that's right.:::['6-21-284']
instead of telling us, you decided to write it in your stupid book?:::['6-21-285']
"marsha and chester are mad at phyllis.":::['6-21-286']
i can't believe i'm gonna lose this job.:::['6-21-287']
i'm so sorry, man. is there anything i can do?:::['6-21-288']
yeah. help me get this mini-fridge past the security guard.:::['6-21-289']
hey, joey, i want to talk to you.:::['6-21-290']
yeah? i don't want to talk to you, wayne. i hate you. you ruined my life.:::['6-21-291']
oh, chandler, wayne. wayne, chandler. hi. how are you?:::['6-21-292']
joey, i'll get you your job back if you help me out.:::['6-21-293']
why should i help you out?:::['6-21-294']
the reason he just said. what do you need?:::['6-21-295']
i saw you on stage talking to that beautiful woman.:::['6-21-296']
you know, sarah. i wish i could talk to her.:::['6-21-297']
are you in love with her? yeah.:::['6-21-298']
her. all of them. anyone.:::['6-21-299']
yeah. i've been there, my friend.:::['6-21-300']
listen, i guarantee you keep your job......if you can teach me how to talk:::['6-21-301']
to women like you do.:::['6-21-302']
oh, wayne, it's not something you can teach. it's something you're born with...:::['6-21-303']
you can teach it. i can show you right now.:::['6-21-304']
i mean, if you think about it......ross did learn something:::['6-21-305']
from each marriage.:::['6-21-306']
how to make the next one even shorter? oh.:::['6-21-307']
wait a minute. that's not fair.:::['6-21-308']
he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was to emily.:::['6-21-309']
he just didn't tell me.:::['6-21-310']
maybe i have to pee again.:::['6-21-311']
well, this is fun.:::['6-21-312']
so ross......did you kill any of these wives?:::['6-21-313']
you know what? i...:::['6-21-314']
i have had enough of this. i care a great deal about your daughter.:::['6-21-315']
and i have treated her with nothing but respect.:::['6-21-316']
so if you've got a problem with me... are you yelling at me?:::['6-21-317']
god, no.:::['6-21-318']
you know what, daddy? if you don't like ross, that's fine.:::['6-21-319']
it doesn't matter to me. i'm gonna go out with him anyway.:::['6-21-320']
well, if it doesn't matter to her......it doesn't matter to me.:::['6-21-322']
still not yelling.:::['6-21-323']
well, what can i say?:::['6-21-324']
this doesn't make me like you better.:::['6-21-325']
that's okay. i'm not so crazy about myself right now either.:::['6-21-326']
then we agree? yeah, i guess so.:::['6-21-327']
neither of us like ross. i like ross.:::['6-21-328']
oh, heh, kids!:::['6-21-329']
wait. i just thought of another story about how nice ross is.:::['6-21-330']
that's okay, rach. we're not liking ross right now.:::['6-21-331']
oh! well, i got a lot of those, too. uh...:::['6-21-332']
well, it turns out you were right, c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['6-21-333']
that shipment never made it to omaha? you got it.:::['6-21-334']
and the rabbi's beard? 100 percent horse hair.:::['6-21-335']
nice catch, c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['6-21-336']
it's your line, c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['6-21-337']
wayne! wayne!:::['6-21-338']
"we've got three minutes till the reactor blows.:::['6-20-0']
we'll never make it!":::['6-20-1']
"you've got to get out of here! save yourself!":::['6-20-2']
"no, i won't leave you.":::['6-20-3']
"don't worry about me. i'm a robot. i'm just a machine!":::['6-20-4']
"no, you're not. not to me." oh, my god.:::['6-20-5']
what? i am extremely talented.:::['6-20-6']
yeah. you're great. yeah.:::['6-20-7']
okay, let's take it from... no, i was really acting my ass off.:::['6-20-8']
i thought i was pretty good too.:::['6-20-9']
yeah, you're solid. you're just no me.:::['6-20-10']
you know what? i think that's enough for now.:::['6-20-11']
i don't want to be over-rehearsed. ha-ha-ha.:::['6-20-12']
fine. i'll do it without you!:::['6-20-13']
i don't need you or anybody else!:::['6-20-14']
i'm gonna make it on my own!:::['6-20-15']
you'll see! you'll all see!:::['6-20-16']
so, what's this thing you're auditioning for?:::['6-20-17']
it's a new tv show. yeah.:::['6-20-18']
i'm up for the part of mac, machiavelli, or "mac"!:::['6-20-19']
i'm a detective and i solve crimes with the help of my robot partner.:::['6-20-20']
he's a computerized, humanoid......electronically enhanced:::['6-20-21']
secret enforcer.:::['6-20-22']
or, "c.h.e.e.s.e.":::['6-20-23']
so, mac and c.h.e.e.s. e? that's the title!:::['6-20-24']
they really lucked out that the initials spell "cheese.":::['6-20-25']
that is lucky.:::['6-20-26']
huh. so, joey, if you get this, you're gonna be, like......the star of your own tv show.:::['6-20-27']
i mean, you'll be like the "big cheese" or the "big mac." hey, you love those!:::['6-20-28']
don't get your hopes up, because it's probably not gonna happen.:::['6-20-29']
now, why would you say that, joseph?:::['6-20-30']
well, i mean, come on, you guys. my own tv show?:::['6-20-31']
i don't know if i'm good enough. i am. heh.:::['6-20-32']
what are you talking about? you're a terrific actor.:::['6-20-33']
you really think so? how can you even ask that question?:::['6-20-34']
chandler: she's pretty. yeah. and she's really nice too.:::['6-20-35']
she taught me all about, you know, how to work with cameras......and "smell the fart" acting.:::['6-20-36']
i'm sorry, what'd you say? ross: excuse me?:::['6-20-37']
it's like you got so many lines to learn so fast......that sometimes you need a minute:::['6-20-38']
to remember your next one.:::['6-20-39']
so while you're thinking of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense.:::['6-20-40']
you know, like this::::['6-20-41']
rachel: oh. chandler: okay.:::['6-20-42']
here's my scene! here's my scene!:::['6-20-43', '2-11-66']
mrs. wallace? i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.:::['6-20-44']
you sister is suffering from a...:::['6-20-45']
we've done some excellent work here.:::['6-20-46']
and i would have to say, your problem is quite clear.:::['6-20-47']
all you want is a dinkle:::['6-20-48', '1-6-9']
what you envy's a schwang:::['6-20-49', '1-6-10']
a thing through which you can tinkle:::['6-20-50', '1-6-11', '8-19-49']
or play with or simply let hang:::['6-20-51']
i play al pacino's butt.:::['6-20-52', '1-6-179']
all right? he goes into the shower and then, i'm his butt.:::['6-20-53']
oh, my god. come on, you guys.:::['6-20-54']
this is a real movie and al pacino's in it, and that's big!:::['6-20-55']
no, it's terrific. you deserve this after all your years of struggling......you've finally been able:::['6-20-56']
to crack your way into show business.:::['6-20-57']
okay, fine, make jokes. i don't care. this is a big break for me.:::['6-20-58']
no, you're right, it is. yeah.:::['6-20-59']
so, you gonna invite us all to the big opening?:::['6-20-60']
all right, i'm out of here. wish me luck.:::['6-20-61']
we all wish you good luck:::['6-20-62']
yeah, whatever.:::['6-20-63']
it's your turn.:::['6-20-64']
oh, are we playing this?:::['6-20-65']
hey. hey. how did the audition go?:::['6-20-66']
terrible. i messed up every line. i shouldn't even be an actor.:::['6-20-67']
wait. are you doing that thing where you pretend it didn't go well......but it really did go well?:::['6-20-68']
yeah, did i fool you? totally!:::['6-20-69']
so, it did go well? it went amazingly well!:::['6-20-70']
great. that's great.:::['6-20-71']
it's down to me and two other guys. chandler: oh, my god.:::['6-20-72']
i know both of them, and they're really good.:::['6-20-73']
one's from those allergy commercials who's always being chased......by those big flowers.:::['6-20-74']
oh, i love that guy.:::['6-20-75']
oh. what are you doing?:::['6-20-76']
what am i doing?:::['6-20-77']
i'm so nervous, you know? the callback isn't till tomorrow at 5.:::['6-20-78']
i feel like my head's gonna explode.:::['6-20-79']
well, it is overdue.:::['6-20-80']
don't worry, okay? you're gonna be fine.:::['6-20-81']
yeah, but it's so much pressure.:::['6-20-82']
no offense, but what you guys all do is very different.:::['6-20-83']
i don't know if you'd understand.:::['6-20-84']
yeah, none of the rest of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs.:::['6-20-85']
yes, i know what time it is......but i'm looking at the wenis:::['6-20-86']
and i'm not happy.:::['6-20-87']
well, i'm tearing the lettuce.:::['6-20-88']
uh-huh? is it dirty? no, don't worry, i'm gonna wash it.:::['6-20-89']
don't. i like it dirty.:::['6-20-90', '2-14-51']
that's your call.:::['6-20-91', '2-14-52']
so, uh, what are you going to do next?:::['6-20-92', '2-14-53']
well, i thought that i would cut up the tomatoes.:::['6-20-93']
are they firm?:::['6-20-94', '2-14-55']
they're all right.:::['6-20-95']
you sure they haven't gone bad? you sure they're not very, very bad?:::['6-20-96']
no, really. they're okay.:::['6-20-97']
you gonna slice them up real nice?:::['6-20-98', '2-14-59']
ahem. actually, i was gonna do them julienne.:::['6-20-99']
i'm out of here.:::['6-20-100', '1-14-108', '9-3-212']
monica, i'm quitting. i just helped an 81 -year-old woman put on a thong......and she didn't even buy it.:::['6-20-101']
i'm quitting. that's it. i'm talking to my boss right now.:::['6-20-102']
yes, i am. yes, i am.:::['6-20-103']
okay, bye. call me when you get this message.:::['6-20-104', '4-13-84']
well, what happened?:::['6-20-105', '1-12-153', '9-22-281', '5-8-116']
well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until...:::['6-20-106']
phoebe: and all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.:::['6-20-108']
was it? oh, boy scouts could've camped under there.:::['6-20-109']

it was a simple mistake. it could happen to anyone.:::['6-20-111']
now calm down.:::['6-20-113', '5-9-203']
come look in my office. some of it may still be in the trash.:::['6-20-114']
what? well, it was quite large.:::['6-20-115']
i had to throw most of it away.:::['6-20-116']
you threw my sandwich away?:::['6-20-117', '5-9-207']
ross: my sandwich?:::['6-20-118']
my sandwich!:::['6-20-119']
it's just, i want this part so much, you know?:::['6-20-120']
if i don't get this part, i'm never gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.:::['6-20-121']
no, i didn't say that. that doesn't count.:::['6-20-122']
come on, guys. it's not like i moved to europe.:::['6-20-123']
i just moved across the hall.:::['6-20-124']
and we would have you over all the time......if it weren't for monica's allergies.:::['6-20-125']
you're right, i could never lie to you.:::['6-20-126']
she hates you.:::['6-20-127']
should i get that? ha-ha-ha.:::['6-20-128']
hello? uh, no, joey's not here right now.:::['6-20-129']

all her. she hates you.:::['6-20-139']
chandler: ooh, ooh, ooh.:::['6-20-140']
yes! all right.:::['6-20-141']
how cool would it be if you could watch like a real life-size version of this?:::['6-20-142']
i mean, how crazy would that be? as crazy as soccer?:::['6-20-143']
what are you talking about? the audition's not till 5.:::['6-20-145']
well, nobody told me.:::['6-20-146']
who'd you talk to?:::['6-20-147']
never mind.:::['6-20-148', '9-9-323', '5-17-189', '4-2-213', '3-2-81']
you mean you didn't get it from this?:::['6-20-149']
the allergy guy got the part. thanks.:::['6-20-150']
maybe we can fix it, you know?:::['6-20-151']
maybe we can send him some big, big flowers and scare him!:::['6-20-152']
how could you do this to me?:::['6-20-153', '6-25-182', '5-1-36']
this part could've turned my whole career around.:::['6-20-154']
i messed up, okay? i'm sorry. i really messed up.:::['6-20-155']
you don't even live here anymore. why'd you answer my phone?:::['6-20-156']
i have a machine! which i bought for you.:::['6-20-157']
taught you how to use it. you thought it was a copier.:::['6-20-158']
if there was anything i could do, i would do it, okay?:::['6-20-159']
but everybody's allowed one mistake, right?:::['6-20-160']
he could have gotten me a vcr. he could have gotten me golf clubs.:::['6-20-161']
but no, he has to get me the "woman repeller.":::['6-20-162']
the eyesore from the "liberace house of crap!":::['6-20-163']
it's not that bad. easy for you to say.:::['6-20-164']
you don't have to sport a reject from the "mr. t collection.":::['6-20-165']
chandler. chandler.:::['6-20-166', '2-14-135']
who puts on my jewelry! i do! i do!:::['6-20-167']
i pity the fool that...:::['6-20-168']
when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking......and one thing led to another and...:::['6-20-170']
and what? did you sleep with her?:::['6-20-171', '4-7-267']
no! no, i just kissed her. what? that's even worse!:::['6-20-172']
how is that worse? i don't know! but it's the same!:::['6-20-173']
you're right, i have no excuses. i was totally over the line.:::['6-20-174']
"over the line?":::['6-20-175']
you're so far past the line that you can't even see the line!:::['6-20-176']
yeah, the line is a dot to you!:::['6-20-177']
i'm not saying that you should magically forgive me.:::['6-20-178']
but you're not perfect. you've made some errors in judgment too.:::['6-20-179']
name one.:::['6-20-180']
what happened?:::['6-20-181', '9-8-239', '7-4-266', '2-10-341', '5-20-279', '4-9-84', '4-2-230', '3-18-34', '3-20-304']
aw, man! he promised he wouldn't take the chairs!:::['6-20-182']
what the hell happened? how were you locked in?:::['6-20-183']
and where the hell's all of our stuff?:::['6-20-184']
this guy came by to look at the unit......and he said he didn't think:::['6-20-185']
it was big enough to fit a grown man.:::['6-20-186', '4-2-234']
so you got in voluntarily?:::['6-20-187', '4-2-235']
i was trying to make a sale!:::['6-20-188']
oh, man, if i ever run into that guy again, you know what i'm gonna do?:::['6-20-189']
bend over?:::['6-20-190', '4-2-238']
there's lorraine.:::['6-20-191', '1-14-44']
okay, now remember, no trading. you get the pretty one, i get the mess.:::['6-20-192']
hi, joey. joey: hey.:::['6-20-193']
well, well. look what you brought.:::['6-20-194']
and what did you bring?:::['6-20-195', '1-14-51']
she's checking her coat.:::['6-20-196', '1-14-52']
joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands.:::['6-20-197']
will you get me a white zinfandel and a glass of red for janice?:::['6-20-198', '1-14-54']
janice?:::['6-20-199', '1-14-55', '3-1-145']
joey's tailor took advantage of me.:::['6-20-201']
no way. i've been going to the guy for 12 years.:::['6-20-203']
he said he was gonna do my inseam......then he ran his hand up my leg:::['6-20-204']
and then there was definite...:::['6-20-205']
cupping.:::['6-20-207', '2-1-261']
that's how they do pants!:::['6-20-208', '2-1-262']
ross, will you tell him?:::['6-20-209']
isn't that how a tailor measures pants? yes, yes, it is. in prison!:::['6-20-210']
i said name one!:::['6-20-211']
i can't believe i did this. what an idiot. stop beating yourself up.:::['6-20-212']
people make mistakes. these things happen.:::['6-20-213']
there aren't any messages you've forgotten to give me, are there?:::['6-20-214']
apparently, you're not very good at it.:::['6-20-215']
do you think he'll ever forgive me? of course he will.:::['6-20-216']
chandler, the most important thing is that you forgive yourself.:::['6-20-217']
you know what, i kind of have. already?:::['6-20-218']
that was pretty bad, what you did.:::['6-20-219']
you know what? he will forgive you.:::['6-20-220']
i like to bring a pad with me when i go answer the phone, just in case. okay.:::['6-20-221']
you didn't see how mad he was, you know?:::['6-20-222']
i'm sure he will forgive you.:::['6-20-223']
look, we've all been there, you know? you fight, you make up.:::['6-20-224']
that's the way it works.:::['6-20-225']
it took two people to break up this relationship!:::['6-20-226']
yeah! you and that girl from the copy place......which yesterday you took:::['6-20-227']
full responsibility for!:::['6-20-228']
i didn't know what i was taking responsibility for, okay?:::['6-20-229', '4-1-291']
i didn't finish the whole letter.:::['6-20-230', '4-1-292']
what? i fell asleep.:::['6-20-231', '4-1-293']
you fell asleep?:::['6-20-232', '9-2-195', '4-1-294']
it was 5:30 in the morning.:::['6-20-233']
and you had rambled on for 18 pages.:::['6-20-234', '4-1-296']
front and back!:::['6-20-235', '4-1-297']
and by the way? y-o-u, apostrophe r-e means, "you are.":::['6-20-236']
y-o-u-r means "your.":::['6-20-237']
i can't believe i thought of getting back together with you.:::['6-20-238']
we are so over!:::['6-20-239']
fine by me!:::['6-20-240', '4-21-247', '4-1-302']
and just so you know, it's not that common......it doesn't happen to every guy,and it is a big deal!:::['6-20-241']
you had no right to go out with him. that is the most ridiculous...:::['6-20-243']
you sold me out! i did not sell you out!:::['6-20-244']
yes, you did! you absolutely sold me... would you let me talk?:::['6-20-245']
did you just flick me?:::['6-20-246', '2-13-177']
okay, well, you wouldn't let me finish and i was just... ow!:::['6-20-247']

there we go.:::['6-20-258', '2-13-202', '4-14-30']
ha. you know what? if we were in prison, you guys would be like my bitches.:::['6-20-259']
okay, buddy boy, here it is.:::['6-20-260', '3-2-279']
you hide my clothes? i'm wearing everything you own.:::['6-20-261']

i can't believe this, chandler! i'm sorry.:::['6-20-287']

i saw the board, i went to the audition, i got the part!:::['6-20-290']
was that supposed to be funny? i was worried over here.:::['6-20-291']
i'm sorry. at times that fake-out thing is mean.:::['6-20-292']
okay, man. i'm sorry. i did not mean to make you feel bad.:::['6-20-293']
well, that's good.:::['6-20-294']
because you didn't. and i'm incredibly happy for you!:::['6-20-295']

you are gonna be a huge star. i'm gonna hug you.:::['6-20-300']
you hug me. all right.:::['6-20-301']
do we do this too much? i think so.:::['6-20-302']
yeah. get off me. yeah.:::['6-20-303']
"come on, c.h.e.e.s.e., i'm not leaving without you.:::['6-20-304']
try routing your backup power source through your primary cpu.":::['6-20-305']
"i can't! my circuits are fried! they're fried, i tell you!":::['6-20-306']
"well, then i'll just have to carry you.":::['6-20-308']
"that'll be a neat trick......when you're dead!":::['6-20-309']
ross, you don't have to yell.:::['6-20-310']
there was just an explosion, okay? my hearing would be impaired.:::['6-20-311']
i thought you were excellent.:::['6-20-312']
in fact, for a minute there, i was like, "ooh, where did ross go?":::['6-20-313']
thank you. and i have to say that first scene where you meet mac...:::['6-20-314']
yeah. oh, my god. i mean...:::['6-20-315']
i think that's enough for today. thanks for your help.:::['6-20-317']
holding us back. totally.:::['6-20-318']
i just got my teacher evaluations. check out what this one student wrote.:::['6-18-1']
"i loved dr. geller's class. mind-blowing lectures.:::['6-18-2']
dr. geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department.":::['6-18-3']
ah, "hotties of the paleontology department.":::['6-18-4']
there's a big-selling calendar, huh?:::['6-18-5']
who wrote it?:::['6-18-6']
i wish i knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.:::['6-18-7']
do you still have their final exams? yeah.:::['6-18-8']
match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and there's your admirer.:::['6-18-9']
a hot girl's at stake and all of a sudden he's rain man.:::['6-18-10']
hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. why are we so sure that this is a girl?:::['6-18-11']
it's a girl.:::['6-18-12']
anyway, it wouldn't matter, okay?:::['6-18-13']
because i'm a teacher. she's a student. chandler: oh, is that against the rules?:::['6-18-14']
no, but it is frowned upon. i see.:::['6-18-15']
besides, there's a big age difference. think of it like this. when you're 90...:::['6-18-16']
i know, when i'm 90, she'll be 80......and it won't seem:::['6-18-17']
like such a big difference.:::['6-18-18']
no, that's not what i was gonna say at all.:::['6-18-19']
what i was gonna say is when you're 90......you'll still have the memory:::['6-18-20']
of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.:::['6-18-21']
chandler, you know that girl you went to college with who became a movie director?:::['6-18-22']
oh, yeah, dana keystone. she was in my movement class.:::['6-18-23']
what's a movement class?:::['6-18-24']
it's chandler's way of pretending he didn't take mime.:::['6-18-25']
listen, anyway, she's directing the new al pacino movie.:::['6-18-26']
you gotta get me an audition. oh. i haven't talked to her in like 10 years.:::['6-18-27']
oh, no, no, no. please, chandler, i would owe you so much.:::['6-18-28']
you do owe me so much. you owe me 3400...:::['6-18-29']
hey, hey, dude. why you changing the subject? what?:::['6-18-30']
will you make the call or what? okay, i'll try.:::['6-18-31']
joey: all right. thanks, you're the best.:::['6-18-32']
the last day of auditions is thursday, so i gotta get in by thursday.:::['6-18-33']
just remember thursday. thursday. can you remember thursday?:::['6-18-34']
yeah, so tuesday?:::['6-18-35']
thursday. look, if you need help remembering, just think of it like this.:::['6-18-36']
the third day. all right? monday, one day.:::['6-18-37']
tuesday, two day.:::['6-18-38']
wednesday, when, huh, what day? thursday.:::['6-18-39']
the third day, okay?:::['6-18-40']
thank you. okay.:::['6-18-41']
hey, mon, i'm gonna check my messages. you just thought of that in there?:::['6-18-42']
sure, you know, nature called. she wants to see who else did.:::['6-18-43']
you guys, someone is in our apartment. call the cops.:::['6-18-47']
you're on the phone.:::['6-18-48']
oh, my god. what?:::['6-18-49', '9-19-253', '9-7-109', '7-23-281', '7-15-105', '7-15-270', '10-7-64', '5-19-152', '4-2-73']
oh, my god. thank you. that was the fire department.:::['6-18-50']
there was a fire at our place. oh, my god. how bad was it?:::['6-18-51']
he didn't say, but it was a fire. i'm guessing not very good.:::['6-18-52']
come on, we gotta go. phoebe, come on.:::['6-18-53']
what are you smiling about? what is so funny?:::['6-18-54']
the part i wanna audition for is a fireman. this is so meant to be.:::['6-18-55']
wow. looks like you were very generous with your grades this semester.:::['6-18-56']
professor geller? yeah? huh?:::['6-18-57']
i wanted to say how much i enjoyed your class.:::['6-18-58']
oh, thank you. thanks very much. ow.:::['6-18-59']
i'm a little embarrassed about calling you a hottie on my evaluation.:::['6-18-60']
that was you? elizabeth: yeah.:::['6-18-61']
i felt a little weird about it. you're a teacher. i'm a student.:::['6-18-62']
but would you maybe wanna go out with me sometime?:::['6-18-63']
oh, i... heh. i don't think that would be the best idea.:::['6-18-64']
oh, because i was thinking, um, the semester's over.:::['6-18-65']
you're not my teacher anymore. what time?:::['6-18-66']
oh, you know what? forget it. i see you already gave me an a.:::['6-18-67']
gotcha. i'm kidding. ha-ha-ha.:::['6-18-68']
oh. ha-ha-ha. ha-ha-ha.:::['6-18-69']
so seriously, what time?:::['6-18-70']
coming through. oh. coming through. oh. hello. hi.:::['6-18-71']
no, right. coming through.:::['6-18-72']
oh. okay. well, it's not so bad.:::['6-18-73']
most of the damage was contained to the bedrooms.:::['6-18-74']
rachel: oh, my god.:::['6-18-75', '4-16-150']
hey, buddy, you think i could borrow your uniform this thursday?:::['6-18-76']
excuse me? joey. he's working.:::['6-18-77']
you would look good in that.:::['6-18-78']
uh-oh. how bad is it? oh, it's bad, it's really bad.:::['6-18-79']
the only thing that isn't burned is an ax, which i do not remember buying.:::['6-18-80']
how's your room, rach? everything's ruined.:::['6-18-81']
my bed, my clothes. look at my favorite blue sweater.:::['6-18-82']
isn't that mine?:::['6-18-83']
fine. i'm sorry for your loss.:::['6-18-84']
you're not gonna be able to live here for a while.:::['6-18-85']
you ladies have a place to stay? oh. wow.:::['6-18-86']
okay, look, pal......i am not in the mood:::['6-18-87']
to be hit on right now.:::['6-18-88']
but if you give me your number, i will call you some other time.:::['6-18-89']
yes, they can stay with us.:::['6-18-90']
have you figured out what started the fire, mr. fireman?:::['6-18-91']
well, uh, do either of you smoke?:::['6-18-92']
no, not usually.:::['6-18-93']
but yeah, i could use one now. thanks. fireman: no, no.:::['6-18-94']
do you light candles, burn incense? yes, i do all the time. i love them.:::['6-18-95']
oh, my god, i did it. it's me, it's me.:::['6-18-96']
i burned down the house. i burned down the house!:::['6-18-97']
okay, phoebe, calm down. there's no need to place blame. okay?:::['6-18-98']
i warned her about those candles.:::['6-18-99']
it's great to catch up. i can't believe how long it's been.:::['6-18-100']
hey, chandler, is that?:::['6-18-101']
oh, that's great. good for you. so, hey, hey, is it?:::['6-18-102']
okay, so, yeah, maybe we can get together, um...:::['6-18-103']
can you hold on for one second, please?:::['6-18-104']
when you're off the phone, you wanna get a pizza?:::['6-18-106']
yeah, that sounds great. okay, well, we'll do it then. okay, bye.:::['6-18-108']
hey, listen, so when's my audition? i know it's thursday, but what time?:::['6-18-109']
hi. we didn't get to the audition.:::['6-18-110']
i'm gonna take her to coffee and do it then. ah.:::['6-18-111']
wow, so now you're going on a date with this girl?:::['6-18-112']
not a date. i haven't talked to her in 10 years.:::['6-18-113']
you can't call somebody you haven't talked to in 10 years and ask for a favor.:::['6-18-114']
there are rules, you know? you gotta put in some time.:::['6-18-115']
you're right, i'm sorry.:::['6-18-116']
it's not like you're going out with an ex. no, we only went out once.:::['6-18-117']
you dated her?:::['6-18-118']
not once.:::['6-18-119']
great. why don't i just go out with an ex, you know, and do joey a favor?:::['6-18-120']
hey, you wanna do joey a favor? maybe you go out with joey.:::['6-18-121']
oh. that's great. my friend joey's in the movie business.:::['6-18-122']
mm. you know who i ran into from school? howie.:::['6-18-123']
hmm. my friend's name is joey. dana: heh.:::['6-18-124']
apparently, howie's editing now.:::['6-18-125']
yeah, he calls me up and asks me if he can edit my new movie.:::['6-18-126']
heh. can you believe that?:::['6-18-127']
you know, i haven't spoken to him in, what, 10 years......and he asks me for a favor?:::['6-18-128']
yeah, i've always hated that howie.:::['6-18-129']
no "how you doing?" heh.:::['6-18-130']
man, i mean, not even a cup of coffee first.:::['6-18-131']
heh. the nerve, huh? dana: yeah.:::['6-18-132']
refill?:::['6-18-133']
now, this is last-minute, so i want to apologize for the mess.:::['6-18-134']
oh. phoebe: who cares?:::['6-18-135']
it sure didn't look this way when i lived here.:::['6-18-137']
there's one problem, though.:::['6-18-139']
there's only room for one, so i guess one of you will have to stay at joey's.:::['6-18-140']
well, since the fire was kind of my fault, i guess you should get to stay here.:::['6-18-141']
hey, hey, hey, now.:::['6-18-142']
this was no one's fault, pheebs, okay? it was an accident.:::['6-18-143']
it was my fault. you should get the nice room.:::['6-18-144']
okay. whoo!:::['6-18-145']
so, rach, you're the first guest at hotel monica.:::['6-18-146']
hotel monica.:::['6-18-147']
monica: just tell me how you like your eggs.:::['6-18-148']
i thought i'd bring them to you, you know, in bed.:::['6-18-149']
rachel: aw. you've been through so much.:::['6-18-150']
i have.:::['6-18-151']
this right here is where i keep the pizza.:::['6-18-152']
and that's where the napkin is.:::['6-18-153']
what's that smell? i know. i don't...:::['6-18-154']
oh, please, it was such a big class. you never even noticed me.:::['6-18-155']
what? of course i did. you sat next to sleepy sleeperson.:::['6-18-156']
oh. i had trouble remembering everyone's names......so i came up with nicknames.:::['6-18-158']
like the guy on the other side of you was smelly von brown-shirt.:::['6-18-159']
oh, yeah. ha, ha.:::['6-18-160', '2-6-109', '5-7-97']
so, um, did you have a nickname for me? uh, no. no.:::['6-18-161']
yes, you did. what was it?:::['6-18-162']
um, it's...:::['6-18-163']
cutie mcpretty.:::['6-18-164']
listen, i gotta tell you, i'm having a great time.:::['6-18-166']
you know how you said it might be weird, the whole student-teacher thing?:::['6-18-167']
and to be frank, i thought it would be too. but it's not. i mean, it's not at all.:::['6-18-168']
dr. geller. burt.:::['6-18-169']
so did you sleep well last night?:::['6-18-170']
rachel: i did. yeah?:::['6-18-171']
i did. monica was so sweet. she left a little mint on my pillow.:::['6-18-172']
know what joey left on my pillow? rachel: what?:::['6-18-173']
gum.:::['6-18-174']
well, we determined the cause of the fire. yeah, i know. it was my candle, my candle.:::['6-18-175']
no, there was an appliance left on in the bathroom.:::['6-18-176']
it looks like a curling iron.:::['6-18-177']
i don't use a curling iron. well, someone does.:::['6-18-178']
don't look at me, my hair's straight. straight, straight, straight.:::['6-18-179']
it could've been a hair-straightener. oh.:::['6-18-180']
this is where i keep the pizza.:::['6-18-181']
and... hey, where'd the napkin go?:::['6-18-182']
there you go. i wouldn't want my best guest to strain her eyes.:::['6-18-183']
thanks, monica.:::['6-18-184']
does that smell bother you? what, the smell from joey's?:::['6-18-185']
no, i can hardly smell it over here.:::['6-18-186']
well, you let me know if you can. because i can bake a pie to cover it.:::['6-18-187']
i can smell it a little. bake the pie. okay.:::['6-18-188']
oh, yes, one minute, please. it's for you. it's the fire inspector.:::['6-18-190']
oh. hello? yeah, this is phoebe.:::['6-18-191']
out that it wasn't the hair-straightener......that started the fire.:::['6-18-193']
no, no. it was the candles.:::['6-18-194']
yeah. it's very not good leaving candles unattended.:::['6-18-195']
in fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is...:::['6-18-196']
uh, okay, well, i have to go now.:::['6-18-198']
we had such a great time. she's incredible.:::['6-18-199']
i thought the age difference might be a problem, but it wasn't.:::['6-18-200']
it wasn't at all. elizabeth is very mature for her age.:::['6-18-201']
a concept lost on some people.:::['6-18-202']
so it's okay to date a student?:::['6-18-203']
well, not really.:::['6-18-204']
i mean, technically, it's not against the rules or anything.:::['6-18-205']
but it is frowned upon......especially by that professor:::['6-18-206']
we ran into last night.:::['6-18-207']
judgy von holier-than-thou.:::['6-18-208']
just be careful, okay?:::['6-18-209']
you don't wanna get a reputation as professor mcnails-his-students. ha, ha.:::['6-18-210']
yeah. what should i do? well, ross, it seems pretty clear.:::['6-18-211']
i mean, what's more important, what people think or how you feel? huh?:::['6-18-212']
ross, you gotta follow your heart. joey, that is so sweet.:::['6-18-213']
hey. hey, hey. so how'd it go with dana?:::['6-18-214']
any reason i should leave a block of time open, say, thursday?:::['6-18-215']
i couldn't do it. you couldn't do it?:::['6-18-216']
relax, i just need more time. we're going to dinner.:::['6-18-217']
what? you're going out with her again?:::['6-18-218']
going out with who? dana keystone, from college.:::['6-18-219']
oh, yeah. wasn't she, uh, mm?:::['6-18-220']
no, that was dana kaplan.:::['6-18-221']
chandler & ross: oh. joey: ah.:::['6-18-222']
joey, you didn't even know her. yeah, whatever.:::['6-18-223']
great story again.:::['6-18-224']
the yarns that you weave.:::['6-18-225']
ha-ha-ha. woo-hoo!:::['6-18-226']
you know, uh, actually, i should get going.:::['6-18-227']
oh, no, no, no, stay, stay, because you should...:::['6-18-228']
you should stay.:::['6-18-229']
oh, i am really flattered.:::['6-18-231']
but i just... i don't feel that way about you.:::['6-18-232']
oh, no, no, no. that's not... no, no, no. dana: i'm sorry, chandler.:::['6-18-233']
you know, you are such a sweet guy, and i don't wanna hurt you.:::['6-18-234']
oh, i wish there were something i could do to make you feel better.:::['6-18-235']
no, no, no... really?:::['6-18-236']
of course.:::['6-18-237', '6-5-208', '6-7-329', '6-2-348', '7-9-138', '2-12-231']
well, it just hurts so bad, i, uh...:::['6-18-238']
oh, i'm sorry.:::['6-18-239', '4-18-38', '3-11-360']
well, maybe there is one thing you can do. what? anything. anything.:::['6-18-240']
well, i mean, this is just off the top of my head now. um...:::['6-18-241']
ahem. but i have this friend, uh, this actor friend......and he would kill me:::['6-18-242']
if he knew that i was doing this, um......but, um, would it be possible for him:::['6-18-243']
to get an audition for your movie......say, on thursday?:::['6-18-244']
absolutely.:::['6-18-245', '8-13-84', '7-4-320', '10-1-130', '5-18-239', '5-13-239', '3-19-139']
but you'd really feel better about me rejecting you......if your friend can audition:::['6-18-246']
for my movie?:::['6-18-247']
well, the heart wants what it wants. i'll see you later.:::['6-18-248']
hey. how's it going?:::['6-18-249', '5-10-69']
well, not much has changed in the last five minutes.:::['6-18-250']
yes, it has. i made cookies.:::['6-18-251']
that's all right. i'm still full from your homemade potato chips, so...:::['6-18-252']
oh. but you should eat them now because they're hot from the oven.:::['6-18-253']
okay. oh. but not in here.:::['6-18-254']
can't eat them in bed, remember? no crummies.:::['6-18-255']
i'll be out in a second.:::['6-18-257']
what are you doing? this doesn't lock, does it?:::['6-18-259']
oh. joey, sorry. oh. oh, it's all right, don't worry about it.:::['6-18-260']
no, but look. oh, that's gonna leave a stain.:::['6-18-261', '8-19-200']
rach, hey, it's fine. you're at joey's.:::['6-18-262', '8-19-201']

that's right, lydia. elizabeth here is a student.:::['6-18-285']
and we're dating.:::['6-18-286']
and you may frown upon that......but we're not gonna hide it anymore.:::['6-18-287']
you are so fired.:::['6-18-288']
what? they're gonna fire you.:::['6-18-289']
you can't date a student. it's against the rules.:::['6-18-290']
really? it's not just frowned upon?:::['6-18-291']
joey: oh. ah. rachel: ah!:::['6-18-292']
i love it at joey's.:::['6-18-293']
rachel: ooh. thanks. nice.:::['6-18-295']

i don't know if you remember, but my audition was supposed to be thursday.:::['6-18-297']
you got me the audition?:::['6-18-298']
chandler: yeah. oh, let's hug it up.:::['6-18-299']
okay, okay, okay.:::['6-18-300', '1-15-272', '7-22-58', '5-21-298']
what are you gonna do to me if you get the part?:::['6-18-301']
yeah, okay, i need to talk to you. rachel: uh-huh.:::['6-18-304']
now, i know that they said that the hair-straightener started the fire......but i think i'm partly at fault.:::['6-18-305']
you see, i didn't tell you, but, um, i had recently refilled the tissues.:::['6-18-306']
and so, you know, let's face it, that's just kindling.:::['6-18-307']
so i think it's better that i stay at joey's.:::['6-18-308']
no, no, no, phoebe, this was my fault.:::['6-18-309']
besides, you know what? i'm fine here. phoebe: okay.:::['6-18-310']
oh, chandler, monica's looking for you. really?:::['6-18-311']
yeah, she said something about crummies. no, no, no. i was so careful.:::['6-18-312']
okay. you have to switch with me. monica is driving me crazy.:::['6-18-313']
that's right. all the ladies wanna stay at joey's.:::['6-18-314']
no, phoebe, come on, i don't wanna switch.:::['6-18-315']
please. come on, i can throw wet paper towels here.:::['6-18-316']
no, but at monica's, you can eat cookies over the sink.:::['6-18-317']
i know. i'm sorry.:::['6-18-318']
all right, fine.:::['6-18-319', '1-9-169', '4-1-152', '3-20-266']

phoebe: god, what a mess.:::['6-18-321']
wow, it actually is in the handbook.:::['6-18-322']
i can't date you or have a hot plate in my office.:::['6-18-323']
oh, i can't believe we have to stop seeing each other.:::['6-18-324']
for what it's worth, i did appreciate you standing up for me.:::['6-18-325']
that felt really nice.:::['6-18-326']
kind of made me like you even more.:::['6-18-327']
i know, i know. i really like you too. but we can't date.:::['6-18-328']
it's against the rules. it's forbidden.:::['6-18-329']
what? just hearing you describe it......as forbidden, it's really hot.:::['6-18-331']
well, i don't care how hot it is, it's, uh... it's wrong.:::['6-18-334']
stop it. no, no. it's wrong. it's...:::['6-18-335']
it's naughty.:::['6-18-336']
it's......taboo.:::['6-18-337']
shut the book.:::['6-18-338']
hey. let's also get a hot plate. oh.:::['6-18-339']

tonight's the big night. how will you ask her?:::['6-24-3']
it'll be perfect. we'll go to her favorite restaurant.:::['6-24-4']
i'll get her a bottle of the champagne she really loves, therefore knows how expensive it is.:::['6-24-5']
then, when the glasses are full, instead of proposing a toast, i'll propose.:::['6-24-6']
aw. sounds perfect!:::['6-24-7']
you'll mess up. let me do it.:::['6-24-8']
i won't mess up.:::['6-24-9']
if she says no, can i have the ring?:::['6-24-10']
she won't say no. if?:::['6-24-11']
hey, monica.:::['6-24-13', '6-25-82']

we're practically kissing.:::['6-24-17']
anyone free tonight? my boss is hosting a charity event for kids.:::['6-24-19']

we can't go. we're going to dinner. remember?:::['6-24-22']
oh, my god. i'm so sorry. what's the big deal?:::['6-24-23']
i just get mad when rachel doesn't remember where we're going.:::['6-24-24']
where are you going?:::['6-24-25']
how about you guys? open bar?:::['6-24-26']
i think so. i can do that for the kids.:::['6-24-27']

ross, can you come to a charity event tonight?:::['6-24-31']
oh. no, i have plans with elizabeth.:::['6-24-32']
oh. you're already doing your part for the kids.:::['6-24-33']
it's our last night together before she leaves for camp. to be a counselor.:::['6-24-34']
i have a question. all jokes aside. where is this relationship going?:::['6-24-35']
wait a minute. all jokes aside? i didn't agree to that.:::['6-24-36']
do you see this as long-term thing? i don't know.:::['6-24-37']
you are 12 years older than her.:::['6-24-38']
wait a minute. does everyone feel this way?:::['6-24-39']
yeah. yeah, sort of.:::['6-24-40']
uh, wow. uh, i thought you were making jokes. i had no idea.:::['6-24-41']
you guys are wrong. yes, there is a chronological age difference.:::['6-24-42']
but i never notice it, because she is very mature.:::['6-24-43']
it doesn't matter what you guys think. i'm dating elizabeth, not you.:::['6-24-44']
not what she said last night.:::['6-24-45']
see, now he could date her.:::['6-24-46']
hey, you marry me.:::['6-24-48']

i don't have $20,000.:::['6-24-110']

"one nation......under god, indivisible,with liberty and justice for all.":::['6-24-115']
ha, ha. i remembered it. the champagne is here.:::['6-24-116']
are you okay? yes. yes.:::['6-24-117']
i'm good. are you good?:::['6-24-118']
are you perfect?:::['6-24-119']
yeah. i'm okay.:::['6-24-120']
i'm a little cold. can i have your jacket?:::['6-24-121']
oh. yeah.:::['6-24-122', '8-17-133', '5-13-23']
uh, no, you can't have my jacket.:::['6-24-123']
because then i would be cold.:::['6-24-124']
if you thought you'd be cold, you should have brought a jacket.:::['6-24-125']
uh, other than that, are you okay?:::['6-24-126']
are you sure you're okay?:::['6-24-127']
yes. i'm fine.:::['6-24-128']
in fact, i've been fine for a long time now and i think......the reason is you.:::['6-24-129']
that's sweet.:::['6-24-130', '1-13-278', '7-6-81']
okay. um.:::['6-24-131', '6-2-355', '7-1-19', '10-13-226', '5-17-235']
before i met you, i had really little life.:::['6-24-132']
and i couldn't imagine growing old...:::['6-24-133']
i know. but let me say it. oh, my god. richard.:::['6-24-135']
what? i'm chandler.:::['6-24-136']
oh, that's richard.:::['6-24-137']
maybe he won't see us. richard!:::['6-24-138']
monica. chandler. chandler: hey.:::['6-24-139']
i don't know why i did that.:::['6-24-140']
it's good to see you. you too. you let your hair grow.:::['6-24-141']
yeah. oh, that's right, you always wanted me to.:::['6-24-142']
i see your mustache is back.:::['6-24-143']
well, my nose got lonely.:::['6-24-144']
and you don't have a mustache, which is good. ha, ha.:::['6-24-145']
i'm chandler. i make jokes when i'm uncomfortable.:::['6-24-146']
i'm sorry. lisa, monica, chandler. we used to date.:::['6-24-147']
richard! no one's supposed to know about us!:::['6-24-148']
see, i did it again.:::['6-24-149']
chandler, sit down. i'll sit down.:::['6-24-150']
monica: good to see you.:::['6-24-151']
your table is ready, sir.:::['6-24-152']
oh. good to see you guys. yes.:::['6-24-153']
if you prefer, this table's available.:::['6-24-154']
that might be fun.:::['6-24-155']
what were you thinking?:::['6-24-156', '1-20-137', '1-5-277', '9-9-184', '7-5-233']
i didn't know it was an auction.:::['6-24-157']
i figured i'd take a guess.:::['6-24-158']
help a charity. free boat!:::['6-24-159']
why would a charity give away a free boat?:::['6-24-160']
i don't know. charity? oh!:::['6-24-161']
well, just buy the damn boat.:::['6-24-162']
phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?:::['6-24-163']
i'm just helping the kids.:::['6-24-164']
how is you drinking helping the kids?:::['6-24-165']
because the more i drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.:::['6-24-166']
mr. tribbiani. your contribution brings us......a big step closer:::['6-24-167']
to building the youth center.:::['6-24-168']
just out of curiosity, how much is that boat worth?:::['6-24-169']
i think it was valued at 19,000.:::['6-24-170']
hey, i was pretty close.:::['6-24-171']
uh, so, bad news.:::['6-24-172']
um, i can't buy the boat. i don't have any money.:::['6-24-173']
joey! joey, good one!:::['6-24-174']
good! very good!:::['6-24-175']
so, uh, i think i'm gonna take off now. you can't leave, joey!:::['6-24-176']
you agreed to buy that boat. it is a contract.:::['6-24-177']
plus, if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me.:::['6-24-178']
well, what am i gonna do, rach? i don't have that kind of money.:::['6-24-179']
i know. okay, okay, okay, okay.:::['6-24-180']
this is what we'll do.:::['6-24-181']
we'll go to the next highest bidder, and we'll let them buy it.:::['6-24-182']
then you're just gonna pay the difference.:::['6-24-183']
i don't know why the kids need a youth center anyway.:::['6-24-185']
they should just watch tv after school like i did. and i turned out fine.:::['6-24-186']
not great.:::['6-24-187']
so we're hiding in the bathroom...:::['6-24-188']
then i sneak out. but before monica can, her parents come in.:::['6-24-189']
i hid in the shower, next thing you know......they're going at it on the floor.:::['6-24-190']
i got a good one.:::['6-24-192']
i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.:::['6-24-193']
it's so great seeing you guys again. i'd like to make a toast.:::['6-24-194']
uh, as a poet once said, "in the sweetness of friendship......let there be laughter:::['6-24-195']
and sharing of pleasures......for in the dew of little things......the heart finds its morning and is:::['6-24-196']
refreshed.":::['6-24-197']
oh, my god! you guys!:::['6-24-200']
before you say anything, have we got a story for you. guess who we bumped into?:::['6-24-201']
who? richard!:::['6-24-202']
i thought you were going out with elizabeth.:::['6-24-204']
i was. uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.:::['6-24-205']
sometimes grownups have commitments they can't get out of.:::['6-24-206']
maybe she is too young for me.:::['6-24-207']
when i was over there, i felt like i was a babysitter.:::['6-24-208']
i finally see what you were talking about. i don't know what to do.:::['6-24-209']
just weigh the good stuff about the relationship against the bad.:::['6-24-210']
that's what i did when i first started weighing stuff.:::['6-24-211']
okay, um, bad stuff. i'm 12 years older than she is.:::['6-24-212']
if school finds out, you're fired.:::['6-24-213']
she's leaving for three months. for camp.:::['6-24-214']
okay, good stuff. um...:::['6-24-215']
well, she's sweet and pretty and...:::['6-24-216']
the only question you need to ask is, do you see a future?:::['6-24-217']
do you see yourself marrying her?:::['6-24-218']
my god. you did it already. you married her, didn't you?:::['6-24-219']
no, i didn't do that. it's just...:::['6-24-220']
honestly, no, i don't see a big future with her.:::['6-24-221']
okay, i think that's your answer.:::['6-24-222']
i gotta talk to her. i hate this part.:::['6-24-223']
forget elizabeth. if you're not careful......you may not get married:::['6-24-224']
at all this year.:::['6-24-225']
rach, rach.:::['6-24-226']
next highest bidder is at table one. great.:::['6-24-227']
the guy who got the paris trip is at table four.:::['6-24-228']
you care about the guy who won the paris trip?:::['6-24-229']
it's a trip for two.:::['6-24-230']
excuse me. is the person who won the paris trip at this table?:::['6-24-232']
that was me. oh. enchanté.:::['6-24-233']
uh, is there a mr. bowmont at this table?:::['6-24-234']
that's me. ah.:::['6-24-235']
hello. this is your lucky day, mr. bowmont.:::['6-24-236']
the, uh, gentleman daysailer has become available again.:::['6-24-237']
i believe you made a bid of $18,000?:::['6-24-238']
you have to pay that. it's not just a guess.:::['6-24-239']
i was actually relieved, uh, i didn't win the boat.:::['6-24-240']
my wife would've killed me.:::['6-24-241']
are you kidding? she'll love this boat!:::['6-24-242']
what is your wife's name? it's pam.:::['6-24-243']
it's pam. just imagine this. the pam.:::['6-24-244']
i don't think she'd like that.:::['6-24-246']
okay. uh, imagine this: the mr. bowmont.:::['6-24-247']
okay, look. let me paint you a little picture. all right.:::['6-24-250']
you are setting sail up the hudson. you've got the wind in your ha... arms.:::['6-24-251']
you get all that peace and quiet you've always wanted.:::['6-24-252']
you get back to nature. you can go fishing.:::['6-24-253']
you get one of those hats, people call you captain.:::['6-24-254']
and then when you're old, cappy.:::['6-24-255']
what the hell. it's for a good cause. all right!:::['6-24-256']
no way! it's mine! what?:::['6-24-257']
the stuff you said, i want that!:::['6-24-258']
but, joey, you don't have $20,000!:::['6-24-259']
who cares? i'll make payments! i want the mr. bowmont!:::['6-24-260']
oh, my god! you're back!:::['6-24-261']
let me see your hand!:::['6-24-262']
why do you want to see my hand?:::['6-24-263']
i want to see what's in your hand, the trash.:::['6-24-264']
ew, it's all dirty. you should throw this out.:::['6-24-265']
what did you just do? what happened?:::['6-24-267']
richard was there. i couldn't do it. oh, no.:::['6-24-268']
i was gonna do it tomorrow and surprise her. now you've ruined it.:::['6-24-269']
we didn't.:::['6-24-270']
who walks into a room and asks to see a person's hands?:::['6-24-271']
a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor.:::['6-24-272']
glove salesman. good one!:::['6-24-273']
this is terrible. what am i gonna do?:::['6-24-274']
she only suspects something. so just throw her off the track.:::['6-24-275']
i'll make her think, uh, marriage is the last thing on my mind.:::['6-24-276']
yeah. convince her you're scared of commitment.:::['6-24-277']
i can do that. i've had 30 years of practice.:::['6-24-278']
being you is finally gonna pay off!:::['6-24-279']
had to go to the basement......some idiot keeps stuffing:::['6-24-280']
the chute with pizza boxes.:::['6-24-281']
that guy's still doing that?:::['6-24-282']
hey. my god, let me see your hand!:::['6-24-283']
no, you're too late! she already took out the trash!:::['6-24-284']
ross: wow. i have never had such a healthy breakup.:::['6-24-285']
she was such a grownup about it.:::['6-24-286']
she didn't seem too immature for me.:::['6-24-287']
did i just make a huge mistake?:::['6-24-288']
ross? wait!:::['6-24-289']
elizabeth, thank god. i was just thinking about...:::['6-24-290']
you suck!:::['6-24-291']
breakup's still on.:::['6-24-294']
here she comes.:::['6-24-295']
do i look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?:::['6-24-296']
and, also, a little like a french guy.:::['6-24-298']
i never noticed that before.:::['6-24-299']
hey, guys. joey: hey.:::['6-24-300', '10-8-0', '5-21-121']
what are you up to?:::['6-24-301']
just hanging out. talking about, uh, web sites.:::['6-24-302']
ahem. we saw this interesting website about marriage.:::['6-24-304']
how unnecessary it is.:::['6-24-305']
how it's a way for governments to keep tabs on you.:::['6-24-306']
yeah, big brother. ha, ha.:::['6-24-307']
that's a little crazy.:::['6-24-308']
although i am glad you're looking at other things on the internet.:::['6-24-309']
got me thinking, why would anybody want to get married?:::['6-24-310']
why? to celebrate the relationship. to solidify the commitment.:::['6-24-311']
to declare your love for one another to the world.:::['6-24-312']
okay. well, that's good to know.:::['6-24-314']
the mr. bowmont's here!:::['6-24-315']
a customer wants to compliment you. shall i let him in?:::['6-24-316']
sure! i love this part!:::['6-24-317']
come on in. hi.:::['6-24-318']
richard.:::['6-24-319']
i'm not here to compliment the chef.:::['6-24-320']
oh. i hate when people come back to compliment the chef.:::['6-24-321']
like i've nothing better to do.:::['6-24-322']
it was great seeing you the other night.:::['6-24-324']
good to see you too.:::['6-24-325']
come down here to tell me that?:::['6-24-326']
no. came here to tell you something else.:::['6-24-327']
came here to tell you i still love you.:::['6-24-328']
what? what did you... what?:::['6-25-0']
i still love you.:::['6-25-1', '9-4-320']
i know i shouldn't even be here telling you this.:::['6-25-2']
you're with chandler, a guy i really like.:::['6-25-3']
you say he's straight, i'll believe you.:::['6-25-4']
after seeing you, i knew if i didn't tell you i'd always regret it.:::['6-25-5']
letting you go was the stupidest thing i ever did.:::['6-25-6']
you're really not supposed to be back here.:::['6-25-7']
i'm sorry. i know this is the wrong time and the wrong place......but i had to tell you.:::['6-25-8']
i want to spend my life with you and marry you.:::['6-25-9']
i want to have kids with you.:::['6-25-10']
why don't they put chairs back here?:::['6-25-12']
i know this is crazy, but am i too late?:::['6-25-13']
yes, you're too late. where was all this three years ago?:::['6-25-14']
i know. i was an idiot.:::['6-25-15']
and i tried to forget you. i really did.:::['6-25-16']
after we had lunch last year, i spent six months in africa trying to forget.:::['6-25-17']
what were you doing in africa? working with blind kids.:::['6-25-18']
what are you doing to me?:::['6-25-19']
look, i...:::['6-25-20', '6-19-149', '3-16-295']
i'm sorry, but it's not gonna happen.:::['6-25-21']
that's fine. i'll walk away. and i'll never bother you again.:::['6-25-22']
only if you tell me chandler's willing to give you everything i am.:::['6-25-23']
well, he is. i mean......marriage is all he talks about.:::['6-25-24']
my goodness.:::['6-25-25']
in fact, i'm the one making him wait.:::['6-25-26']
you are? yeah.:::['6-25-27']
why? why?:::['6-25-28', '10-3-27', '5-4-209']
because of the government.:::['6-25-29']
isn't it incredible?:::['6-25-30']
monica and chandler are getting married.:::['6-25-31']
i know. they'll be so happy together.:::['6-25-32']
two best friends in love. how often does that happen?:::['6-25-33']
not that often. no.:::['6-25-34']
i'm so happy for them.:::['6-25-35']
me too. so happy for them.:::['6-25-36']
i'm so happy and not at all jealous.:::['6-25-37']
oh, no! god, definitely not jealous. mm-mm.:::['6-25-38']
i'm probably 98 percent happy and maybe 2 percent jealous.:::['6-25-39']
what's 2 percent? that's nothing.:::['6-25-40']
totally.:::['6-25-41', '6-3-161', '10-11-56']
i'm like 90-10. yeah. me too.:::['6-25-42']
hey, have you guys seen chandler?:::['6-25-43']
no. but you know who was looking for you?:::['6-25-44']
tennille.:::['6-25-45']
so that marriage stuff you were saying yesterday?:::['6-25-46']
you don't really believe that. sure, i do.:::['6-25-47']
in fact, i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural.:::['6-25-48']
look at pigs. let's take a second here and look at pigs.:::['6-25-49']
pigs don't mate for life.:::['6-25-50']
a pig can have 100 sexual partners in a lifetime.:::['6-25-51']
and that's just an ordinary pig, not even a pig that's good at sports.:::['6-25-52']
wait a minute.:::['6-25-53', '8-20-162', '9-7-112', '9-4-98', '9-14-310', '7-6-47', '7-6-261', '7-16-82', '10-16-113', '5-5-30', '4-3-81', '3-4-303']
are you telling me you may never want to get married?:::['6-25-54']
never say never, but, probably......yeah, never.:::['6-25-55']
then what are we even doing? what is this?:::['6-25-57']
whoa, whoa, whoa, what is all this pressure?:::['6-25-58']
is this some new strategy?:::['6-25-59']
why don't you put down your copy of the rules, huh, man-trap?:::['6-25-60']
you know what? i gotta go.:::['6-25-61']
it's okay. i got a plan.:::['6-25-62']
we're gonna find love. definitely.:::['6-25-63']
yeah, i'm pretty confident about that.:::['6-25-64']
that's what makes it so easy to be 80 percent happy for monica and chandler.:::['6-25-65']
would be nice to have a guarantee. what do you mean?:::['6-25-66']
some people make deals with a friend.:::['6-25-67']
like if neither of them are married by 40, they marry each other.:::['6-25-68']
you mean a backup? exactly.:::['6-25-69']
yeah, yeah. i've got that.:::['6-25-70']
you do? mm-hm.:::['6-25-71']
who? joey?:::['6-25-72']
joey? are you serious? yeah.:::['6-25-73']
yeah, i locked him in years ago.:::['6-25-74']
wait. so if neither of you are married by 40, you'll marry joey?:::['6-25-75']
yep. we shook on it.:::['6-25-76']
yeah. but believe me, that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.:::['6-25-77']
seriously?:::['6-25-78', '9-8-165', '9-15-165', '10-5-370']
i think his exact words were...:::['6-25-79']
charming.:::['6-25-80']
ah, he's just a backup. yeah.:::['6-25-81']
have you seen rachel? or a mirror?:::['6-25-83']
it's for my boat. cool, huh?:::['6-25-84']
yeah, it's great.:::['6-25-85']
what's the matter? talk to the captain.:::['6-25-86']
just realizing i'm in a dead-end relationship.:::['6-25-87']
chandler's giving you a hard time?:::['6-25-88']
i don't want to get married tomorrow. but i want to believe......we're going somewhere,that i'm not wasting my time.:::['6-25-89']
you know chandler. no, i don't know chandler.:::['6-25-90']
not anymore. it's like something's changed.:::['6-25-91']
maybe you changed.:::['6-25-92']
i didn't change.:::['6-25-93']
maybe that's the problem.:::['6-25-94']
what? chandler is a complex fellow.:::['6-25-95']
one who is unlikely to take a wife.:::['6-25-96']
does he think i'll just wait around for nothing?:::['6-25-97']
face it. chandler is against marriage.:::['6-25-98']
and always will be.:::['6-25-99']
well, there's some people who do want to marry me.:::['6-25-100']
there are? yeah. richard.:::['6-25-101']
richard said he wants to marry you?:::['6-25-102']
and chandler says he hates marriage? that's right.:::['6-25-103']
chandler loves marriage!:::['6-25-104']
you just told me he hates marriage!:::['6-25-105']
that he's a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife!:::['6-25-106']
that he's against marriage and always will be!:::['6-25-107']
you got that from what i said?:::['6-25-108']
rach. hey, you.:::['6-25-109']
hey, come on in. thank you.:::['6-25-110']
i'm so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth.:::['6-25-111']
thanks. yeah, i really thought we'd be able to make it work.:::['6-25-112']
i guess it just wasn't meant to be.:::['6-25-113']
yeah. love.:::['6-25-114']
it's a tricky business, isn't it?:::['6-25-115']
i guess so.:::['6-25-116', '9-1-91', '9-4-294', '10-1-348', '10-17-600', '2-16-360', '5-19-83']
so, what do you say we make a pact?:::['6-25-117']
if you and i are both single by 40, we get married.:::['6-25-118']
i mean, we know each other, we like each other......we've already slept together,so there'll be no surprises there.:::['6-25-119']
no, like, "what's that?":::['6-25-120']
oh, you want me to be your backup. exactly.:::['6-25-121']
oh, yeah. i already have one.:::['6-25-122']
who? phoebe.:::['6-25-123']
but she just said joey is her backup.:::['6-25-125']
oh, i don't think so.:::['6-25-126', '4-19-221', '4-3-187']
i just spoke with her. she said that she and joey made a deal.:::['6-25-127']
that's impossible. we have had a deal for years.:::['6-25-128']
we shook on it.:::['6-25-129']
although, believe me, she wanted to do a lot more than that.:::['6-25-130']
where have you been?:::['6-25-131', '1-21-224']
i was making a coconut phone with the professor.:::['6-25-132']
richard told monica he wants to marry her.:::['6-25-133']
what? i've been looking for you.:::['6-25-134']
stop messing with her!:::['6-25-135']
and i would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!:::['6-25-136']
oh, my god! i know! they suck!:::['6-25-137']
he's not supposed to ask her to marry him! i am!:::['6-25-138']
i know! what...?:::['6-25-139']
you know what i'll do? i'll go over there and kick his ass!:::['6-25-140']
will you help me?:::['6-25-141']
look, us getting our asses kicked is not a solution.:::['6-25-142']
look, just go and find monica. you're right.:::['6-25-144']
i'm gonna get the ring......i'll go find her......and i'll propose!:::['6-25-145']
dude! dude! dude!:::['6-25-146']
that coconut phone might be good for the boat.:::['6-25-147']
hi.:::['6-25-148', '6-4-255', '1-9-123', '1-21-56', '1-21-114', '1-19-51', '1-1-29', '1-16-78', '1-3-159', '1-2-88', '1-2-192', '1-15-44', '1-7-206', '8-3-114', '8-2-58', '8-1-74', '8-5-174', '8-4-241', '8-7-238', '8-13-6', '8-17-107', '9-6-230', '9-4-300', '7-23-124', '7-24-166', '7-8-278', '7-7-259', '7-4-327', '7-15-226', '10-5-229', '10-5-312', '10-12-56', '10-12-187', '2-8-329', '2-10-42', '2-10-142', '2-10-356', '2-9-206', '2-9-262', '2-12-80', '2-17-170', '2-15-54', '2-23-21', '2-6-301', '2-4-141', '2-4-143', '2-21-255', '2-5-96', '2-5-97', '5-20-169', '5-20-268', '5-9-56', '5-9-149', '5-4-76', '5-4-318', '5-5-242', '5-6-193', '5-2-156', '5-3-302', '4-13-139', '4-11-310', '4-14-97', '4-15-170', '4-23-142', '4-1-10', '4-3-143', '3-24-127', '3-25-354', '3-20-104', '3-12-289', '3-2-363', '3-13-259', '3-17-44', '3-7-62', '3-6-119', '3-6-253']
i don't know why i'm here.:::['6-25-149']
i didn't ask.:::['6-25-150']
you want to come in?:::['6-25-151']
i'll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.:::['6-25-154']
chandler is such an idiot!:::['6-25-155']
drink?:::['6-25-156']
scotch on the... rocks with a twist?:::['6-25-157']
i remember.:::['6-25-158']
you still smoking cigars? uh...:::['6-25-159']
no, no. that's art.:::['6-25-160']
if it bothers you, i can put my art out.:::['6-25-161']
no, that's okay.:::['6-25-162', '7-24-263']
so, monica......let me ask you a question.:::['6-25-163']
since we broke up, do you ever......think about me?:::['6-25-164']
actually, i thought about you a couple months ago.:::['6-25-165']
really? yeah, but it's because i......had an eye exam,and i don't like my new eye doctor.:::['6-25-166']
who is it? edward nevsky.:::['6-25-167']
yeah, he's no good.:::['6-25-168']
do you ever think about me in......a non-eye-doctor way?:::['6-25-169']
because getting over you was the hardest thing i've ever had to do.:::['6-25-172']
i never let myself think about you.:::['6-25-173']
phoebe, you picked joey and ross?:::['6-25-175']
you can't have two backups!:::['6-25-176']
of course i can.:::['6-25-177']
it's just good sense to back up your backup.:::['6-25-178']
look, i've already lost chandler. what?:::['6-25-179']
hey, phoebe!:::['6-25-180']
we're both backups?:::['6-25-181']
what are you complaining about? you were both aware of the situation.:::['6-25-183']
i was not! no, we weren't!:::['6-25-184']
this kind of back talk isn't gonna fly when we're married.:::['6-25-185']
you can't have both. pick one.:::['6-25-186']
pick me! no, pick me!:::['6-25-187']
i don't want to end up an old maid.:::['6-25-188']
well, let's see.:::['6-25-189', '8-11-118']
ross is a good father.:::['6-25-190']
but......joey has a boat. this is hard.:::['6-25-191']
this is crazy. i want to switch to rachel.:::['6-25-192']
i want to switch too.:::['6-25-193']
phoebe: no, wait! okay, just wait!:::['6-25-194']
wait, guys. don't make any rash decisions.:::['6-25-195']
remember my promise::::['6-25-196']
if we get married, three times a week.:::['6-25-197']
oh, my god. phoebe...:::['6-25-198']
i'm talking about massages.:::['6-25-199']
i know how to settle this. here's what we'll do.:::['6-25-201']
i'll write "joey"......on one napkin.:::['6-25-202']
and i'm going to write "ross" on the other napkin......and we'll pick one.:::['6-25-203']
that person will be our backup. here we go.:::['6-25-204']
joey: that sounds fair. ross: all right.:::['6-25-205']
good. switching them up.:::['6-25-206']
ooh...:::['6-25-207']
pick one. left.:::['6-25-208']
thank you. you're welcome.:::['6-25-209', '7-24-191', '7-9-308', '7-10-268']
ross. joey.:::['6-25-210']
we should just switch. absolutely.:::['6-25-211']
i miss this apartment.:::['6-25-212']
now, this is a grownup's apartment.:::['6-25-213']
i should be with a grownup, you know? yeah.:::['6-25-214']
you're saying you need to be with someone more mature.:::['6-25-215']
maybe someone with......a license to practice medicine.:::['6-25-216']
or a mustache.:::['6-25-217']
let's face it. i'm not a kid anymore.:::['6-25-218']
i need to be with someone who wants the same things.:::['6-25-219']
coming to my work and telling me you love me, i want that!:::['6-25-220']
talking about pig sex over lunch, i don't want that!:::['6-25-221']
i think that's fair.:::['6-25-222']
fair? please. don't even talk to me about fair.:::['6-25-223']
fair would've been you wanting to marry me then.:::['6-25-224']
or chandler wanting to marry me now.:::['6-25-225']
believe me, nothing about this is fair. nothing.:::['6-25-226']
nothing! nothing! it's okay.:::['6-25-227']
hey. shh.:::['6-25-228', '9-2-304']

she said she had to think things over.:::['6-25-245']
oh, my god. i can't believe this. i thought you were a good guy.:::['6-25-246']
oh, hey. look, nothing happened.:::['6-25-247']
nothing happened? nothing? you didn't tell her you love her?:::['6-25-248']

my girlfriend is thinking things over.:::['6-25-251']
you made my girlfriend think!:::['6-25-252']
well, i'm sorry.:::['6-25-253', '10-9-105', '3-15-268']
what's to think about? i love her.:::['6-25-254']
well, apparently i'm willing to offer her things that you are not.:::['6-25-255']
i'm willing to offer her those things. this was just a plan.:::['6-25-256']
to throw her off so when i offered all these things, she'd be surprised.:::['6-25-257']
if it helps, it worked very well.:::['6-25-258']
it was working till you showed up, you big tree.:::['6-25-259']
this isn't fair.:::['6-25-260', '8-6-204']
you had your chance with her, and you blew it!:::['6-25-261']
this is my chance and i won't blow it......because we are meant for each other.:::['6-25-262']
and this has all just been one stupid mistake!:::['6-25-263']
i was gonna propose tonight.:::['6-25-264']
you were?:::['6-25-265']
yeah, i even......got a ring.:::['6-25-266']

no, i don't have a ring.:::['6-25-268']
you go get her.:::['6-25-269']
and can i give you a piece of advice?:::['6-25-270']
if you do get her......don't let her go.:::['6-25-271']

what? she was crying.:::['6-25-279']
she said you want different things and she needs to think.:::['6-25-280']
why didn't you tell her it was a plan?:::['6-25-281']
i did! i told her everything. she wouldn't believe me.:::['6-25-282']
well, where...?:::['6-25-283']
to her parents'. she said you shouldn't call.:::['6-25-285']
but if i were you, i would.:::['6-25-286']
can't believe i ruined this.:::['6-25-287']
i am so sorry, man.:::['6-25-288']
you wanted it to be a surprise.:::['6-25-289']
chandler......in all my life......i never thought i would be so lucky......as to fall in love with my best...:::['6-25-291']
my best...:::['6-25-292']
there's a reason why girls don't do this! okay, okay, okay.:::['6-25-293']
i'll do it. i thought...:::['6-25-294']
wait, i can do this.:::['6-25-295']
i thought that it mattered......what i said or where i said it.:::['6-25-296']
then i realized......the only thing that matters is that you...:::['6-25-297']
you make me happier than i ever thought i could be.:::['6-25-298', '7-21-94']
and if you let me......i will spend the rest of my life:::['6-25-299']
trying to make you feel the same way.:::['6-25-300', '7-21-96']
monica......will you marry me?:::['6-25-301']

hi, joey. how you doing? great......roomie.:::['6-19-4']
yeah, i guess we are roommates now. i know. now that you bring it up......uh, our fridge is broken.:::['6-19-6']
we have to get a new one.:::['6-19-7']
i checked around and your half is $400. thanks a lot.:::['6-19-8']
i'm not paying for half of that.:::['6-19-9']
i'm only staying here until my apartment gets fixed.:::['6-19-10']
look, rach, my parents bought this fridge just after i was born. okay?:::['6-19-11']
now, i have never had a problem with it. then you show up and it breaks!:::['6-19-12']
what does that tell you?:::['6-19-13', '2-21-125']
that refrigerators don't live as long as people?:::['6-19-14']
all right, you know that the atm only lets you take out 300 at a time......so i'll take a check:::['6-19-15']
for the other 100.:::['6-19-16']
heh. you're joking, right?:::['6-19-17']
of course i'm joking. i don't take checks.:::['6-19-18']

a box of thin mints and some tagalongs.:::['6-19-57']
guys, give him a break. ross, seriously, how's it going with her?:::['6-19-58']
well, it's actually been great.:::['6-19-59']

well, that is great. and seriously, she seems very nice.:::['6-19-61']
i know you guys like to give me a hard time......but it means a lot to me:::['6-19-62']

that's so funny, we found someone too.:::['6-19-71']
that's good. i guess she'll have a choice between my guy and your weirdo.:::['6-19-72']
why would our guy be a weirdo? because that's just your taste.:::['6-19-73']

you don't understand. elizabeth was about to ask me to go on a trip with her.:::['6-19-123']
is that taking it slow? i'm not ready for this, okay?:::['6-19-124']
what do i tell her? tell her the truth. you're not ready.:::['6-19-125']
i could do that.:::['6-19-126', '1-22-39', '1-6-151']
well, what if she gets upset? then you distract her with a barbie doll.:::['6-19-127']
or......you could just, you know, you...:::['6-19-128']
what the hell are you doing?:::['6-19-129', '6-4-178', '7-19-252', '10-10-263']
wha...?:::['6-19-130']

look, i've been having a great time with you.:::['6-19-150']
and i just don't want us to move too fast or put too much pressure on us.:::['6-19-151']
so i'm sorry, i just don't think we should go away together yet.:::['6-19-152']
it's too soon.:::['6-19-153']
uh, ross, i think you misunderstood what i was saying.:::['6-19-154']
i just wanted to tell you that i'm going to florida for a couple weeks.:::['6-19-155']
i think you misunderstood what i was saying.:::['6-19-157']
what i meant was... you are so adorable.:::['6-19-158']
that. let's talk about that.:::['6-19-159']
how did it go with elizabeth? huh? oh, oh.:::['6-19-161']
fine. it was just a misunderstanding. she didn't want me to go with her.:::['6-19-162']
she just wanted to let me know that she's going to florida for spring vacation.:::['6-19-163']
wait, is she going for spring vacation or going for spring break.:::['6-19-164']
what's the difference?:::['6-19-165']
a spring vacation, you're doing nice things with your grandparents.:::['6-19-166']
spring break, you're doing frat guys.:::['6-19-167']
hey, you know what? not all spring breaks are like that.:::['6-19-168']
what did you do on yours? i went to egypt with my dad.:::['6-19-169']
i can see it now. "look, dad, it's the sphinx.":::['6-19-170']
i think elizabeth is a little more serious than, "spring break!":::['6-19-171']
all right? come on, she's taking my class.:::['6-19-172']
and slept with the professor. i'm gonna call her.:::['6-19-173']
hey, you guys, i want you to meet sebastian.:::['6-19-174']

what, i read that.:::['6-19-177']
can i get you a cup of coffee? oh, yes. thank you.:::['6-19-178']
rachel, what the hell is this? what?:::['6-19-179']
you ask us to find you a guy, and then you come in here with a guy of your own.:::['6-19-180']
you found me a guy? yes.:::['6-19-181']
we found you a really cute, funny guy from chandler's work.:::['6-19-182']
yeah, and i found you one, too, who is not a weirdo.:::['6-19-183']
you know what though, guys, i really appreciate that......but i'm just gonna take sebastian:::['6-19-184']
to the charity.:::['6-19-185']
are you sure? because our guy smells incredible.:::['6-19-186']
would you stop it with that already?:::['6-19-187']
here you go. sure. oh, thank you.:::['6-19-188']
so, sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?:::['6-19-189']
uh, no, not really. why? no reason.:::['6-19-190']
it's just i know a single guy who does care about other people.:::['6-19-191']
are you funny?:::['6-19-192']
excuse me? what are you guys doing?:::['6-19-193']
are you funny? tell us a joke!:::['6-19-194']
look, i just wanted to have coffee with rachel.:::['6-19-195']
well, so do a lot of people.:::['6-19-196']
actually, uh, i gotta get going. oh, but you...:::['6-19-197']
give me a call sometime. but you didn't give me your number.:::['6-19-198']
okay, see you later.:::['6-19-199', '7-7-331']
turns out he is kind of funny.:::['6-19-200']
i cannot believe you guys!:::['6-19-201']
he was really nice and he just left because of you!:::['6-19-202']
yeah, but, "sebastian"? what is that, a cat's name?:::['6-19-203']
you know what i noticed, rachel, he scares easy.:::['6-19-204']
now, is that the kind of guy you want to take to a ball?:::['6-19-205']
"sebastian, would you like to dance?":::['6-19-206']
"uh, okay. i gotta go. aah!":::['6-19-207']
all right, guys stop it. rachel, we're very sorry.:::['6-19-208']
that is a very insensitive thing for us to do.:::['6-19-209']
you know what? let us make it up to you. we've two great guys for you.:::['6-19-210']
phoebe: yeah, what have you got to lose?:::['6-19-211']
you might even end up with someone really special. if you pick my guy.:::['6-19-212']
all right. okay. so you will meet our guys?:::['6-19-213']
yes, i'll meet them.:::['6-19-214']
it doesn't matter which one you choose. it's up to you.:::['6-19-215']
our guy is perfect.:::['6-19-216']
or you could go out with the guy phoebe deemed......not good enough to go out with herself.:::['6-19-217']
ugh!:::['6-19-218', '2-19-266']
phoebe, there you are! okay, you broke my fridge.:::['6-19-219']
you owe me 400 bucks.:::['6-19-220']
okay, sure. really?:::['6-19-221']
ooh, technically, you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts......on your last 10 auditions.:::['6-19-222']
call it even?:::['6-19-223']
there you are. so, what did elizabeth say?:::['6-19-225']
well, turns out she is going to daytona for "spring break, woo-hoo.":::['6-19-226']
that means wet t-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girls' bodies......waking up next to people:::['6-19-227']
you don't even know.:::['6-19-228']
man, she is gonna have a great time!:::['6-19-229']

in 1981, you were 13.:::['6-19-232']
so what? i drove down, sold t-shirts. i had a blast.:::['6-19-233']

okay, she can't go.:::['6-19-235']
you can't tell her not to go. you just started dating.:::['6-19-236']
then what am i supposed to do? nothing. just be cool with it.:::['6-19-237']
what if she goes down there and sleeps with a bunch of guys?:::['6-19-238']
well, maybe you don't marry this one.:::['6-19-239']
i'm so glad you're going on this trip.:::['6-19-240']
yeah, i've been working so hard this semester.:::['6-19-241']
i really need to go crazy, you know? blow off some steam.:::['6-19-242']
sure. sure.:::['6-19-243']
look, i don't know if your plans are finalized yet......but i know another great way:::['6-19-244']
to blow off steam.:::['6-19-245']
what? are you into crafts at all?:::['6-19-246']
ross, are you okay? uh, yeah. of course i'm okay.:::['6-19-247']
heh, i'm just being, uh, supportive.:::['6-19-248']
supportive of you and this whole trip......and what... what is, uh...? what's this?:::['6-19-249']
it's a bathing suit? to wear in front of people?:::['6-19-250']
is that supportive? is this?:::['6-19-251']
hey. good, good, good.:::['6-19-252']
monica & chandler: hey. hi.:::['6-19-253']
we're glad you decided to meet our guy. oh.:::['6-19-254']
you're gonna like him so much.:::['6-19-255']
uh, when do you want to meet him? i don't know.:::['6-19-256']
i don't work late tomorrow night. tomorrow night is good.:::['6-19-257']
but why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now. ha-ha-ha.:::['6-19-258']
eldad, come here! rachel: what?:::['6-19-259']
eldad, this is rachel. how are you?:::['6-19-260']
a little blind-sided, but, you know, good.:::['6-19-261']
eldad, sit down. move over. move over now.:::['6-19-262']
there you go. there you are.:::['6-19-263']
okay, we can take a hint! ha-ha-ha.:::['6-19-264']
wait. what are you doing here? this is patrick.:::['6-19-265']
you're too late, because she's already with our guy.:::['6-19-267']
oh, my god, you're right, i am too late. they're sitting on the couch and talking.:::['6-19-268']
rachel? this is patrick. yeah?:::['6-19-270']
oh. hi. patrick: hi.:::['6-19-271']
this is the guy i was telling you about.:::['6-19-272']
believe me, this suit does not do justice to what's underneath it.:::['6-19-273']
but pheebs, i'm just sort of in the middle of something.:::['6-19-275']
oh, okay. that's okay. have a seat.:::['6-19-276']
you can't do that! maybe i should go.:::['6-19-277']
just sit down, we're winning.:::['6-19-278']
okay, you know what? maybe i should go.:::['6-19-279']
monica & phoebe: no, no! chandler: have a seat!:::['6-19-280']
rachel, you haven't touched eldad's hair.:::['6-19-281']
it is the softest hair. touch it. rachel: i'm good.:::['6-19-282']
rachel, patrick is really rich. give her some money.:::['6-19-283']
phoebe, this isn't really worth the free massage.:::['6-19-284']
that's right, patrick. bye-bye.:::['6-19-285']
eldad is much more cooperative and he can dance.:::['6-19-286']
you dance for rachel.:::['6-19-287']
no, don't dance for me, please!:::['6-19-288']
what is the matter with you guys?:::['6-19-289']
yeah, okay, let's talk it out.:::['6-19-290']
am i the only one that this is embarrassing for?:::['6-19-291']
i'm a little embarrassed. shh, shh.:::['6-19-292']
i'll tell you who should be embarrassed. it's you guys. this is ridiculous!:::['6-19-293']
thank you, but i do not need you to get me a date.:::['6-19-294']
then why did she ask us to help... i am still talking!:::['6-19-295']
then you chase away the one guy that i actually liked.:::['6-19-296']
no offense to you guys. really, congratulations on......all the cash.:::['6-19-297']
and you really... wow, you do have very soft hair.:::['6-19-298']
but i'd much rather go to the ball by myself than go through any more of this!:::['6-19-299']
goodbye.:::['6-19-300', '9-11-193', '4-15-304']
now, do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?:::['6-19-301']
yes, papaya extract. thank you.:::['6-19-302']
so, uh, have a great time down there. i will.:::['6-19-303']
did you pack that bathing suit? yeah.:::['6-19-304']
it was pretty funny when i hid it for a while, huh?:::['6-19-305']
anyway. um...:::['6-19-306']
i am worried about that bathing suit.:::['6-19-307']
not because it's revealing, which i'm fine with.:::['6-19-308']
no, i'm concerned about your health.:::['6-19-309']
um, sun exposure.:::['6-19-310']
oh, don't worry, i have plenty of sun block.:::['6-19-311']
it's spf 30. all right.:::['6-19-312']
well, if what's in the bottle is actually 30.:::['6-19-313']
i mean, sometimes you get 30, sometimes it's 4, and i swear......more often than not, it's just milk.:::['6-19-314']
ross, it's gonna be okay.:::['6-19-315']
i'm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys.:::['6-19-316']
i really like you. i like how things are going between us.:::['6-19-317']
i'm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.:::['6-19-319']
okay. cool. heh.:::['6-19-320']
oh, here they are. hey, elizabeth!:::['6-19-321']
bye!:::['6-19-322']
call me!:::['6-19-323']
rachel, we're sorry for pushing those guys on you.:::['6-19-324']
that's all right. i ended up having a really good time.:::['6-19-325']
the charity was a big success, they raised a lot of money and awareness.:::['6-19-326']
so, what was it for, anyway?:::['6-19-327']
i wanna say a disease.:::['6-19-328']
i just got this weird message from ross. he said turn on mtv. i don't know.:::['6-19-330']
oh, my god, look! that's elizabeth! rachel: ha-ha-ha.:::['6-19-331']
oh, oh, professor geller.:::['6-19-332']
ah, to be 13 again.:::['6-19-333']
oh, i cannot believe that you didn't tell me we are still married.:::['6-5-0']
look, i was going to tell you.:::['6-5-1']
when? after the birth of our first secret child?:::['6-5-2']
ross didn't get the annulment. we are still married.:::['6-5-3']
monica: you're kidding? oh, my god.:::['6-5-4']
okay, maybe it wasn't my best decision......but i couldn't face:::['6-5-6']
another failed marriage.:::['6-5-7']
let me just jump in and ask.:::['6-5-8']
at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?:::['6-5-9']
rach, come on. if you think about it, it's actually kind of funny.:::['6-5-10']
okay, maybe it's best not to think about it.:::['6-5-11']
oh, this is inexcusable. i'm shocked to my very core.:::['6-5-12']
phoebe, i told her you already knew.:::['6-5-13']
another lie. you have a sickness.:::['6-5-14']
ross, just for my own peace of mind......you're not married:::['6-5-15']
to any more of us, are you?:::['6-5-16']
oh, hey, someone left their keys.:::['6-5-17']
ooh, to a porsche.:::['6-5-18']
hey, gunther, are these yours? yeah. that's what i drive.:::['6-5-19']
i make 4 bucks an hour. i saved up for 350 years.:::['6-5-20']
uh-uh.:::['6-5-21', '7-13-206']
hey, did anybody lose their keys?:::['6-5-22']
why don't you put them in the lost and found?:::['6-5-23']
there's a lost and found?:::['6-5-24']
my shoe!:::['6-5-25']
you left a shoe here?:::['6-5-26']
well, i didn't realize till i got home.:::['6-5-27']
i wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe.:::['6-5-28']
i'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.:::['6-5-29']
oh, good. when he comes back for his keys, i'll be sure to give him your shoe.:::['6-5-30']
great. thanks.:::['6-5-31', '5-20-33', '3-20-344']
oh, good, good. you guys are here. listen.:::['6-5-32']
how would you like to spend tomorrow......taking care of three:::['6-5-33']
incredibly cute little puppies?:::['6-5-34']
oh, my god. what a fun day. that sounds great.:::['6-5-35']
yeah, all right.:::['6-5-36', '1-3-325', '2-18-328', '2-2-82', '2-21-40', '4-14-304']
okay, well, i'll bring them by tomorrow morning.:::['6-5-37']
okay, and by the way, they're not actually puppies.:::['6-5-38']
they're frank and alice's triplets. okay, see you.:::['6-5-39']
whoa, whoa, whoa. what?:::['6-5-40']
please, please, please? frank and alice......asked me to babysit the triplets.:::['6-5-41']
i'm nervous. i've never done that by myself.:::['6-5-42']
don't worry about it, phoebe. we'll do it.:::['6-5-43']
yeah, i'm gonna pass, because i was kind of iffy when it was puppies.:::['6-5-44']
come on, chandler. come on, it'll give us great practice for when......people with babies come to visit.:::['6-5-45']
man: nice car.:::['6-5-46']
yeah, it's, uh... it's not mine.:::['6-5-47']
i love your car. yeah. it's mine.:::['6-5-48']
i bet it's fast. me too. yeah.:::['6-5-49']
and comfortable.:::['6-5-50']
do you, uh, like leather seats? yeah.:::['6-5-51']
it's got them.:::['6-5-52']
so i still have boxes here.:::['6-5-53']
i still have boxes at ross'.:::['6-5-54']
and i have nowhere to live.:::['6-5-55']
wow, i could so easily freak out right now.:::['6-5-56']
what about me?:::['6-5-57', '2-10-331']
i just found out denise is leaving town for a while. i don't have a roommate.:::['6-5-58']
well, maybe i could be your roommate, pheebs.:::['6-5-59']
maybe you could be my roommate.:::['6-5-60']
well, there's an idea. yeah.:::['6-5-61']
that would be great. oh.:::['6-5-62']
wait, how long is denise gone for? um, she said she'd be back december 26th.:::['6-5-63']
oh! december 26th.:::['6-5-64']
heh, maybe she's santa claus.:::['6-5-65']
oh, look who it is. my husband, the apple of my eye.:::['6-5-66']
okay, i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2......and i picked up all the forms.:::['6-5-67']
i'll take care of everything.:::['6-5-68']
sure, if you say you're gonna take care of everything......i have no reason to doubt you.:::['6-5-69']
give me those forms.:::['6-5-70']
all right, now, i'm gonna do this my way, and i don't wanna hear a peep out of you.:::['6-5-71']
okay, rach, but... ah, you're peeping.:::['6-5-72']
ross, you know what? i just got...:::['6-5-73']
why? why did you do this? look, i told you...:::['6-5-74']
i don't wanna hear "three failed marriages.":::['6-5-75']
look, if you'd had two failed marriages, you'd understand.:::['6-5-76']
well, you know what? thanks to you, i'm halfway there.:::['6-5-77']
oh, i am so mad, ross. i don't think i've ever been this angry.:::['6-5-79']
what about the time i said we were on a break?:::['6-5-80']
i'm doing okay. do you think they're having fun? am i talking too fast?:::['6-5-83']
no. you sound like me.:::['6-5-84']
it's going great. look at chandler with little baby girl chandler.:::['6-5-85']
little baby girl chandler. where have i heard that before? oh, right, coach rubin.:::['6-5-86']
you know what, pheebs?:::['6-5-87', '4-10-214']
when you're done over there, we've got a kind of situation over here too.:::['6-5-88']
uh-uh. no. we are all responsible for our own babies.:::['6-5-89']
see, that's where i think you're wrong. we've been playing them man-to-man.:::['6-5-90']
we should really be playing a zone defense.:::['6-5-91']
what do you mean?:::['6-5-92', '1-20-234', '1-24-98', '1-6-258', '9-16-269', '7-1-299', '10-2-318', '2-10-237', '2-11-95', '2-11-148', '2-9-185', '4-16-254', '4-6-297', '3-12-250']
i just think things will go smoother......if we each have our own zone, you know?:::['6-5-93']
phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.:::['6-5-94']
and, mon, you can be in charge of diapering.:::['6-5-95']
and i can be in charge of looking at how cute they are when they put their hands...:::['6-5-96']
that sounds really great, but you should be in charge of wiping.:::['6-5-97']
okay, i'm a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.:::['6-5-98']
monica: wow, this is so great.:::['6-5-99']
this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.:::['6-5-100']
yeah? well, this is not what i ordered.:::['6-5-101']
hey, guys. group: hey.:::['6-5-102']
hey, babies.:::['6-5-103']
i'm having the best morning.:::['6-5-104']
that, uh, porsche i've got the keys to? still there.:::['6-5-105']
shocking, since you still have the keys.:::['6-5-106']
you should see the treatment i get when i'm with that car.:::['6-5-107']
people are friendly. they wanna talk. and not just about the car.:::['6-5-108']
one guy advised me on my equity investments.:::['6-5-109']
what equity investments?:::['6-5-110']
the ones that got me the porsche. will you keep up?:::['6-5-111']
i figured, if people keep seeing me just standing there......they're gonna start to think:::['6-5-112']
i don't own it.:::['6-5-113']
so i figure i'll wash it, right? monica, you got a bucket and some soap?:::['6-5-114']
oh, yeah. i got soap and sponges and rags......and carnauba wax:::['6-5-115']
and polishing compound.:::['6-5-116']
you don't even have a car.:::['6-5-117']
i know. but one time there was this dirty car parked in front of the building......so i washed it.:::['6-5-118']
and? and six others.:::['6-5-119']
there you are.:::['6-5-120', '1-10-231', '5-1-212']
yeah, she tops out at 130. wow.:::['6-5-121']
and that's just in the city. i get her up to 160 upstate.:::['6-5-122']
really? you got a place upstate?:::['6-5-123']
well, i'll see you later. okay. take it easy.:::['6-5-125']
hey. that's my car.:::['6-5-126']
really? oh, uh...:::['6-5-127']
just give me five more minutes.:::['6-5-128']
well, i found the keys, and now i'm just polishing her up.:::['6-5-130']
but it's my car. yeah, but it's my wax.:::['6-5-131']
listen, i don't come to the city much.:::['6-5-132']
and i don't know if you're crazy or if this is some kind of street theater......but could i have my keys?:::['6-5-133']
sure. yeah. i'll save your parking spot.:::['6-5-134']
i'm not coming back.:::['6-5-135']
why not? i live upstate.:::['6-5-136']
yeah, so did i.:::['6-5-137']
i don't know why i was so nervous about this......and i don't know why frank and alice:::['6-5-138']
are always complaining. this is easy.:::['6-5-139']
yeah, two hours, a lifetime, that's the same.:::['6-5-140']
check it out. check it out. when the babies wake up......they can meet krog.:::['6-5-141']
what are you doing? that thing could put someone's eye out.:::['6-5-142']
he can do more than that. he can destroy the universe.:::['6-5-143']
no, chandler, they could swallow one of those little parts.:::['6-5-144']
and also, look at his smooth area. that's just gonna mess them up.:::['6-5-145']
they're not gonna swallow anything. you're too overprotective.:::['6-5-146']
when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass.:::['6-5-147']
what? glass, sand, whatever.:::['6-5-148']
oh, look at little leslie stretching in her sleep.:::['6-5-149']
oh, it's so cute.:::['6-5-150']
i wonder what age it is when you stop putting both legs behind your head.:::['6-5-151']
oh, i can still do that.:::['6-5-152']
how are you still single?:::['6-5-153']
all right, ahem. i thought about it, and maybe you're right.:::['6-5-154']
maybe krog is not a safe toy.:::['6-5-155']
good. what made you change your mind? i swallowed his sonic blaster gun.:::['6-5-156']
how did that happen?:::['6-5-157', '1-6-126']
well, i was trying to prove that i was right, you know?:::['6-5-158']
and it turns out i was wrong......and now it's lodged in my throat.:::['6-5-159']
damn it, this whole time we were concentrating on the babies......and no one was watching chandler.:::['6-5-160']
okay, you two are asking the court for an annulment?:::['6-5-161']
yes, your honor. and here are our forms, all filled out.:::['6-5-162']
judge: so based on your petition......you are seeking an annulment:::['6-5-163']
on the grounds......that "mr. geller is mentally unstable.":::['6-5-164']
fine. i'm mentally unstable.:::['6-5-165']
and based on the fact that "mr. geller is an intravenous drug user.":::['6-5-166']
what? uh, yes. heroin and crack.:::['6-5-167']
crack isn't even an intravenous drug.:::['6-5-168']
well, you would know.:::['6-5-169']
now, it also says here that you::::['6-5-170']
"lied about your sexual preference before marriage.":::['6-5-171']
oh, come on. ross, please. i found the magazines.:::['6-5-172']
and, finally, that you were "unable to consummate the marriage.":::['6-5-173']
well, that makes sense since you're gay and addicted to heroin.:::['6-5-174']
okay, you know, i'm sorry, this is insane.:::['6-5-175']
i'm not addicted to heroin, i'm not gay, and there is no problem......with my ability:::['6-5-176']
to consummate anything.:::['6-5-177']
look, i'll consummate this marriage right here, right now.:::['6-5-178']
that won't be necessary.:::['6-5-179']
and when we were dating, we consummated like bunnies.:::['6-5-180']
now, if you two were involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.:::['6-5-181']
your honor, rest assured, that relationship ended two years ago.:::['6-5-182']
and can you please strike "consummated like bunnies" from the record.:::['6-5-183']
is there anything in this record that is actually true?:::['6-5-184']
uh, well, yes. we got married in vegas.:::['6-5-185']
and, uh, the names, i think.:::['6-5-186']
well, based on what i've heard......you two certainly don't qualify:::['6-5-187']
for an annulment.:::['6-5-188']
if you don't wanna be together, you'll have to file for divorce.:::['6-5-189']
that's great. you happy now? look what you did with your funny, funny form.:::['6-5-190']
what? me? what about you and your "consummated like bunnies" nonsense?:::['6-5-191']
and what...? what are you typing that for?:::['6-5-192']
she already said we don't get the annulment.:::['6-5-193']
don't type that. what...?:::['6-5-194']
stop typing. hey.:::['6-5-195']
stop typing.:::['6-5-196']
stop typing, "stop typing.":::['6-5-197']
okay, okay, do you see what you're keeping me married to?:::['6-5-198']
you need to get out of my chambers.:::['6-5-199']
all right, lady, here's the deal.:::['6-5-200']
i came here for an annulment, and i'm not leaving here until i get one.:::['6-5-201']
would you like to spend the night in jail? thank you for your time.:::['6-5-202']
that porsche guy took his car back.:::['6-5-203']
but you found the keys to his clothes?:::['6-5-204']
no, i just, uh...:::['6-5-205']
i love the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche.:::['6-5-206']
people would think you own a porsche because of the clothes?:::['6-5-207']
only an idiot would wear this stuff if he didn't have the car.:::['6-5-209']
that is true.:::['6-5-210']
yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.:::['6-5-211']
oh, i've been there.:::['6-5-212']
i am gonna go drive my porsche.:::['6-5-213']
joey, you know you don't actually have one.:::['6-5-214']
come on. what are you doing? i'm in character. will you talk to her?:::['6-5-215']
ah, i think it just moved. it's really poking me.:::['6-5-216']
that's it. we're going to the emergency room.:::['6-5-217']
what? no, you can't leave me here with them. we're babysitting.:::['6-5-218']
the babies are asleep. i'm sure you'll be okay on your own.:::['6-5-219']
but you can't leave me with them. we're a team.:::['6-5-220']
we're playing a zone. they're gonna triple-team me.:::['6-5-221']
he's got something plastic in his throat. we gotta go to the hospital.:::['6-5-222']
but, no, because a doctor won't be able to help him. and it's just gonna, you know......naturally pass through his system:::['6-5-223']
in, like, seven years.:::['6-5-224']
i think that's gum. i'm pretty sure it's gun.:::['6-5-225']
okay, listen, this really hurts. let's go.:::['6-5-226']
but no. a real man wouldn't just run to the hospital.:::['6-5-227']
no. what would krog do?:::['6-5-228']
why isn't that valet back with my porsche?:::['6-5-229']
maybe because you've got the keys?:::['6-5-230']
that was totally your fault. my fault? you threatened the judge.:::['6-5-231']
well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporter's machine.:::['6-5-232']
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing!:::['6-5-233']
hi. how are the gellers?:::['6-5-235']
don't call us that.:::['6-5-236']
the judge wouldn't let us get an annulment. now we gotta get a divorce.:::['6-5-237']
did a porsche throw up on you?:::['6-5-238']
it's "porsche.":::['6-5-240']
me taking care of you is no problem, huh?:::['6-5-241']
you guys feel safe, right?:::['6-5-242']
okay, i'm gonna take that spit bubble as a "yeah, i do.":::['6-5-243']
let's get rid of this dirty diaper, leslie. i'll set you up with a nice clean one.:::['6-5-244']
okay, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to scare you. i just have to clean that up, okay?:::['6-5-245']
because, let's face it, we're at monica's.:::['6-5-246']
i broke it. all right. well, that's just the way things go.:::['6-5-247']
okay. good.:::['6-5-248', '10-17-18']
why are there only two of you?:::['6-5-249']
where's leslie?:::['6-5-250']
well, you can't answer. leslie? where are you, leslie?:::['6-5-251']
leslie, now would be a good time for your first words.:::['6-5-252']
well, look at you.:::['6-5-253']
you are a little bit mischievous. my gosh.:::['6-5-255']
oh, you're a lot mischievous.:::['6-5-256']
well, it'll dry.:::['6-5-257']
okay, you sit with your brother and sister now......who aren't there.:::['6-5-258']
hey. how do you feel?:::['6-5-259']
well, let's just say that krog will be equipped to destroy the universe again......in 12 to 14 hours.:::['6-5-260']
okay, so i totally took care of the babies all by myself.:::['6-5-261']
i fed them, bathed them and put them to bed.:::['6-5-262']
and protected them from a tornado?:::['6-5-263']
i know. the babies are asleep.:::['6-5-265']
phoebe, what happened here?:::['6-5-266']
i did it. i took care of the babies all by myself.:::['6-5-267']
but my apartment. was the setting of phoebe's triumph.:::['6-5-268']
but the mess.:::['6-5-269']
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.:::['6-5-270']
you're right. you're right, i shouldn't freak out.:::['6-5-271']
this is what it's gonna be like when we have babies.:::['6-5-272']
when will that be?:::['6-5-273']
phoebe, would you take a look at this mess?:::['6-5-274']
oh, honey, thank god you're home. i was getting worried.:::['6-5-275']
i picked up the divorce papers.:::['6-5-276']
uh, i've already signed everything. and i put little x's where you need to sign.:::['6-5-277']
oh, little x's. great. that makes up for everything.:::['6-5-278']
you know, you've done a lot of stupid stuff too, okay?:::['6-5-279']
oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one.:::['6-5-280']
okay, how about you flew to london to stop my wedding?:::['6-5-281']
how about you told me you loved me after i was married?:::['6-5-282']
wait a minute, that was different.:::['6-5-283']
i did those things because i was in love with you.:::['6-5-284']
yeah. right.:::['6-5-285']
you're right. that's very different.:::['6-5-286']
so let's just sign the papers.:::['6-5-287']
what? nothing.:::['6-5-288', '8-13-154', '10-5-311']
okay, can we just sign, please?:::['6-5-289']
congratulations.:::['6-5-291', '9-1-126', '7-22-246', '7-24-157', '2-16-340', '2-3-222']
okay, wait, ross. wait a minute. um...:::['6-5-292']
i, uh, kind of have a little confession.:::['6-5-293']
uh, well, you know, this whole marriage thing.:::['6-5-295']
kind of my idea.:::['6-5-296']
remember how we were too drunk to remember anything......the night we were married?:::['6-5-298']
yeah?:::['6-5-299', '1-18-111', '1-17-229', '1-7-183', '8-14-228', '8-17-122', '8-23-18', '9-3-125', '9-9-322', '7-9-62', '7-1-196', '7-12-178', '7-10-282', '2-13-259', '5-5-147', '5-14-154', '4-7-99', '3-8-228', '3-19-288', '3-22-72', '3-23-55', '3-23-287', '3-3-113']
and yeah, i didn't really wanna say anything......but it just kind of kept:::['6-5-300']
coming back to me.:::['6-5-301']
um, remember, we were in the casino......and for some reason, you thought it'd:::['6-5-302']
be funny to eat a lot of grapes.:::['6-5-303']
and i thought it would be funnier if we got married.:::['6-5-304']
so, ahem, as a compromise, we decided first to get married and then......to eat a lot of grapes.:::['6-5-305']
to eat a lot of grapes.:::['6-5-306']
sorry i got us into this whole thing.:::['6-5-308']
so then, i mean, if you think about it......this is all your fault.:::['6-5-309']
yeah, don't push it, though.:::['6-5-310']
i gotta say......i know i divorce a lot of women.:::['6-5-311']
never thought i'd be divorcing you.:::['6-5-312']
i always thought if you and i got married, that would be the one that stuck.:::['6-5-314']
and it wouldn't be a secret......and we wouldn't have our:::['6-5-315']
wedding dinner at pizza hut.:::['6-5-316']
did i even treat?:::['6-5-317']
no, it was on the house. it was a newlywed special.:::['6-5-318']
that may be the most depressing thing i've heard in my life.:::['6-5-319']
well, i should probably get these to my lawyer's office.:::['6-5-320']
hey, thanks, ross, for taking care of all this.:::['6-5-321']
ah, no problem. yeah.:::['6-5-322']
i'm gonna need a copy of those. totally.:::['6-5-323']
hey, hey, hey. careful around my porsche.:::['6-5-325']

married, oh, she'll be happy.:::['6-4-11']
you know? you're just... you're very sad.:::['6-4-12']

wow. what did he say?:::['6-4-30']
uh, remember that paper i had published last year on sediment flow rate?:::['6-4-31']
well, they loved it. well, who wouldn't?:::['6-4-32']
anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer.:::['6-4-34']
i mean, it's temporary, but if they like me, it could lead to a full-time job.:::['6-4-35']
how great would that look on the mailbox, huh? professor geller.:::['6-4-36']
yeah. professor and mrs.:::['6-4-37']

well, ahem.:::['6-4-46']

she told me that i'm gonna die this week......so i'm kind of bummed about that.:::['6-4-48']
what? i know you don't know about readings......but that one is pretty much:::['6-4-49']
the worst one you can get.:::['6-4-50']
phoebe, that's crazy.:::['6-4-51']
i can't believe she'd say that to you?:::['6-4-52']
yeah, honey, you don't believe her, do you?:::['6-4-53']
i don't know. she, you know, said that i'd have triplets......but she also said one of them:::['6-4-54']
would be black.:::['6-4-55']
chandler: oh.:::['6-4-56', '7-14-77', '2-13-229', '5-9-143']
just out of curiosity, did she tell you how you were gonna go?:::['6-4-57']
no, because she didn't tell me i was gonna die till the end of the session.:::['6-4-58']
and i was not gonna waste a whole other hour there.:::['6-4-59']
i mean, i've only got a week left, you know?:::['6-4-60']
i've really gotta start living now.:::['6-4-61']

no, that'd be great.:::['6-4-65']
"there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate.:::['6-4-67']
each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two...":::['6-4-68']
oh, this is it. this is what's gonna kill me.:::['6-4-69']
"...subcategories. the first of these subcategories is...":::['6-4-70']
joey: um, ross? heh.:::['6-4-71']
are there, uh, naked chicks on that piece of paper?:::['6-4-72']
no. why?:::['6-4-73', '1-17-339', '9-23-108', '9-23-516', '7-24-11', '4-20-256']
well, i just never seen a guy stare so hard at paper......that didn't have naked chicks on it.:::['6-4-74']
oh, okay. okay.:::['6-4-75']
"there are three primary theories......concerning sediment flow rate.:::['6-4-76']
each of these theories......can be further subcategorized into...":::['6-4-77']
why don't you open with a joke?:::['6-4-78']
open with a joke? it's a university, not a comedy club.:::['6-4-79']
wait a minute, hold the phone.:::['6-4-80']
you're not talking about chuckles university?:::['6-4-81']
group: come on, we're kidding.:::['6-4-83']
you know what might make it less boring?:::['6-4-84']
some, um... some visual aids.:::['6-4-86']
oh, oh! you know what's a good visual aid?:::['6-4-87']
please don't say naked chicks.:::['6-4-88']
why not?:::['6-4-89', '1-7-109', '8-15-271', '9-12-108', '7-22-152', '7-8-229', '7-7-304', '7-10-33', '10-5-305', '2-16-260', '5-13-143', '4-11-126', '4-16-59', '3-18-229', '3-8-116', '3-13-314']
i don't even know why i bothered to even talk to you guys about it.:::['6-4-90']
you know, i'm just gonna do it on my own, with no naked chicks.:::['6-4-91']
that's the way i did it till i was 19.:::['6-4-92']
any good mail?:::['6-4-94']
yes, you got something from the screen actors guild.:::['6-4-95']
ooh, it's probably a residual check. hey, can you open it? i got...:::['6-4-96']
"benefits lapsed." hmm. that's weird.:::['6-4-97']
i don't remember being in a movie called benefits lapsed.:::['6-4-98']
okay, it's not a check.:::['6-4-99']
they're saying your health insurance expired because......you didn't work enough last year.:::['6-4-100']
let me see that.:::['6-4-101', '7-20-267', '4-11-211']
oh, i can't believe this.:::['6-4-103']
this sucks.:::['6-4-104']
when i had insurance, i could get hit by a bus......or catch on fire, you know?:::['6-4-105']
and it wouldn't matter. now i gotta be careful?:::['6-4-106']
i'm sorry, man. there's never a good time to have to......stop catching on fire.:::['6-4-107']
all right, well......i guess i gotta go get a job.:::['6-4-108']
i'm gonna see my agent.:::['6-4-109']
okay, make sure to look both ways before you cross the street.:::['6-4-110']
before you cross the street.":::['6-4-111']
hey. hey, pheebs, you're still alive.:::['6-4-112']
how are you feeling?:::['6-4-113']
it's so exhausting, waiting for death.:::['6-4-114']
oh, by the way, do you think you...:::['6-4-115']
pheebs, what are you doing?:::['6-4-116']
i was preparing you for... didn't you think i was dead?:::['6-4-117']
did that not come off?:::['6-4-118']
oh, yeah, scared the hell out of me. i thought we'd lost you forever.:::['6-4-119']
pheebs, you wanna lie down? yeah, thanks.:::['6-4-120']
and listen, can you do me a favor?:::['6-4-121']
could you just wake me up in a couple hours.:::['6-4-122']
you know, if you can.:::['6-4-123']
rachel: monica?:::['6-4-124', '2-15-128', '2-15-133']
did you take these back?:::['6-4-125']
no, no. i just liked them so much that i went out and bought some for myself.:::['6-4-126']
oh, yeah, they're really great, aren't they?:::['6-4-127']
i love them. yeah.:::['6-4-128']
nice try.:::['6-4-129', '7-21-65', '5-8-333', '3-9-258']
hello. hey, how'd the lecture go?:::['6-4-130']
it went great.:::['6-4-131']
and i didn't need any jokes or naked chicks either.:::['6-4-132']
oh, that's great. i'm sorry we weren't supportive before.:::['6-4-133']
i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself.:::['6-4-134']
everyone's all, uh, "ross, you have to be funny and sexy.":::['6-4-135']
well, i proved them wrong.:::['6-4-136']
and now i'm gonna pass the news on to joey and chandler.:::['6-4-137']
that you're not funny or sexy? that's right.:::['6-4-138']
hey, estelle, listen... well, well, well.:::['6-4-139']
so you came back, huh?:::['6-4-141']
they think they can do better, but they all......come crawling back to estelle.:::['6-4-142']
what are you talking about?:::['6-4-143', '1-20-308', '9-11-232', '2-2-244', '5-4-56', '5-6-247', '5-3-62', '5-13-176', '5-17-221', '5-14-100', '3-8-250', '3-20-282', '3-23-301', '3-4-346']
i never left you. you've always been my agent.:::['6-4-144']
oh, well, no harm, no foul.:::['6-4-146']
look, estelle, you gotta get me some work. i lost my health insurance.:::['6-4-147']
all right, first thing we gotta do: damage control.:::['6-4-148']
why? well, i think, uh......someone out there......may have been bad-mouthing you:::['6-4-149']
all over town.:::['6-4-150']
the bastard.:::['6-4-151']
so estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow.:::['6-4-153']
and i'll have my health insurance back in no time.:::['6-4-154']
that's great, but shouldn't you be on the toilet right now?:::['6-4-155']
what? what's wrong with you?:::['6-4-156']
well, i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before.:::['6-4-158']
and then i, uh, passed out......and, uh, i haven't been able:::['6-4-159']
to stand up since. ha, ha.:::['6-4-160']
but i don't think it's anything serious.:::['6-4-161']
this sounds like a hernia. you have to... go to the doctor.:::['6-4-162']
no way.:::['6-4-163', '1-7-75', '8-19-126', '3-25-117']
if i'm gonna go to the doctor for anything......it's gonna be for this thing:::['6-4-164']
sticking out of my stomach.:::['6-4-165', '8-19-128']
that's a hernia.:::['6-4-166']
why'd i have to start working out again?:::['6-4-167', '8-19-129']
damn you, 15s.:::['6-4-168']
we're a little early. the lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.:::['6-4-169']
yeah, but we can sneak in and watch. yeah. good.:::['6-4-170']
oh, hey, look. there's some kappa kappa deltas.:::['6-4-171']
i was a kappa. hey, sisters.:::['6-4-172']
wow, we really are bitches.:::['6-4-173']
right. so when rigby got his samples......back from the laboratory......he made a startling discovery.:::['6-4-174']
what he believed to be igneous was, in fact, sedimentary.:::['6-4-175']
imagine his consternation when...:::['6-4-176']
oh, bloody hell.:::['6-4-177']
look, i was nervous.:::['6-4-179']
you guys had me all worried i was gonna be boring.:::['6-4-180']
i got up there and they were all, like, staring at me.:::['6-4-181']
i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out.:::['6-4-182']
yeah, and not a very good one.:::['6-4-183']
will you, please?:::['6-4-184']
dr. geller? kurt rathman.:::['6-4-185']
i'm a professor in the paleontology department here.:::['6-4-186']
do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?:::['6-4-187']
i'm sorry, i've got plans with my sister.:::['6-4-188']
monica geller.:::['6-4-189']
right. will you excuse us for one moment?:::['6-4-190']
you can have an accent, but i can't?:::['6-4-192']
top of the morning to you, laddies.:::['6-4-193']
would you just please stop?:::['6-4-194']
bombay is very, very nice this time of year.:::['6-4-196']
hey, will you grab me a cruller?:::['6-4-197']
sit down.:::['6-4-198']
will you go to the hospital? dude, hernia operations cost, like......a lot probably, okay?:::['6-4-199']
besides, it's getting darker and more painful.:::['6-4-200']
that means it's healing.:::['6-4-201']
look, i will loan you the money.:::['6-4-202']
just go to the hospital and let's just get that thing......pushed back in.:::['6-4-203']
thank you, but it'd take me forever to pay you that money back.:::['6-4-204']
and i don't want that hanging over my head, okay?:::['6-4-205']
besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in......i can get all the free operations i want.:::['6-4-206']
i think i'll probably start with that laser eye surgery.:::['6-4-207']
joey: hey. what's going on?:::['6-4-209']
well, joey's got a bad hernia......but it's nothing a little:::['6-4-210']
laser eye surgery won't fix.:::['6-4-211']
look, i'm telling you, if i put my hand on my stomach right here......it doesn't hurt that bad. ah.:::['6-4-212']
hey, maybe you'll die.:::['6-4-213']
chandler, i'm scared.:::['6-4-214']
phoebe: no, we can go together.:::['6-4-215']
just don't wait too long, though......because i'm out of here:::['6-4-216']
sometime before friday.:::['6-4-217']
but i don't want to die.:::['6-4-218']
no, no. it'll be fun.:::['6-4-219']
we can come back and we can haunt these guys.:::['6-4-220']
give me them. no, they are mine.:::['6-4-221']
you stole them from me. you stole them from me.:::['6-4-222']
give me them.:::['6-4-223']
you just wanna each take one?:::['6-4-224']
yeah, that seems fair. we never use them.:::['6-4-225']
look, i really need some help, okay?:::['6-4-226']
why? why did i have to speak in a british accent?:::['6-4-227']
what do i do?:::['6-4-228', '8-16-131', '3-4-319']
well, why don't you phase it out? yeah, phase the accent out.:::['6-4-229']
people will think that you're adjusting to life in america.:::['6-4-230']
yeah, i mean, come on. no one will even notice.:::['6-4-231']
i mean, they're probably not even listening to you.:::['6-4-232']
they're not listening to me?:::['6-4-233']
of course they're listening to you.:::['6-4-234']
everybody listens to you.:::['6-4-235']
monica, do you really think i should try this phasing-out thing?:::['6-4-236']
i think you look fine.:::['6-4-237']
director: whenever you're ready. okay.:::['6-4-238']
hey, timmy.:::['6-4-239', '6-4-244']
i've got a surprise......for you.:::['6-4-240']
director: hold it. i'm sorry.:::['6-4-241']
the surprise is a new swing set. if you could play it less intense.:::['6-4-242']
oh, yeah. sure, no problem. just hold on one second.:::['6-4-243']
i've got a surprise for you.:::['6-4-245']

pick up a bag today.:::['6-4-248']
that's where you pick up the bag. exactly.:::['6-4-249']
no, the line is, "pick up a bag," so you need to pick up the bag.:::['6-4-250']
or i could just point to it. huh?:::['6-4-251']
blah, blah, blah. purina one. point to a bag today.:::['6-4-252']

she must have read the cards wrong. oh, i'm sorry.:::['6-4-267']
ah, better her than me.:::['6-4-268']
hey, let's bake cookies!:::['6-4-269']

"take good care of your mama, son," that's your cue to cry. got it?:::['6-4-281']
all right, let's do this.:::['6-4-282', '2-21-323']
scene five, take one.:::['6-4-283']
director: and action.:::['6-4-284']

uh, one thing, is it all right with you if i scream......right up until you say, "action"?:::['6-4-296']
sure. okay.:::['6-4-297', '6-3-54', '7-12-96', '10-13-144', '3-21-225']
action! take good care of your mama, son.:::['6-4-298']
cut. aah!:::['6-4-299']
i'm sorry. hey, hey. joe, why don't you lift up your shirt?:::['6-4-300']
take a look at this, kiddo.:::['6-4-301']
we have a crying child! roll the damn cameras!:::['6-4-302']
hello. hello, is ross there?:::['6-4-303']
no, he's not. can i take a message?:::['6-4-304']
yes, this is russell, ross' divorce lawyer.:::['6-4-305']
just tell him that since i haven't heard from him......i assume he's decided:::['6-4-306']
to give the marriage a try.:::['6-4-307']
ross got married again? aah! no.:::['6-4-308']
ross: all right, keep going. we are phasing the accent out.:::['6-4-309']
phasing it out.:::['6-4-310']
"so without retesting their results in the laboratory......the team would never:::['6-4-311']
have identified......the initial errors:::['6-4-312']
in their carbon dating analysis.":::['6-4-313']
were there any questions at this point?:::['6-4-314']
yes. what's happening to your accent?:::['6-4-315']
come again? what's this nonsense?:::['6-4-316']
all right. i'm not english.:::['6-4-317']
i'm from long island.:::['6-4-318']
i was really nervous, and the accent......just, um... just came out.:::['6-4-319']
ha, ha. i'm sorry.:::['6-4-320']
so if we could just get back to the lecture.:::['6-4-321']
um, were there any questions?:::['6-4-322']
about paleontology?:::['6-4-323']
all right, look, i was just trying to make a good first impression.:::['6-4-324']
obviously, i screwed up.:::['6-4-325']
but what you guys think of me is really important......because i'm hoping:::['6-4-326']
to get a permanent job here.:::['6-4-327']
so if you'd just give me another chance to make a good impression...:::['6-4-328']
ross. are you crazy?:::['6-4-329']
i am still your wife? what, were you just never gonna tell me?:::['6-4-330']
what the hell is wrong with you?:::['6-4-331']
ugh, i could just kill you!:::['6-4-332']
well, hello, rachel.:::['6-4-333']
you've really done this before? yeah. yeah, yeah.:::['6-4-334']
you just take a big, big swing, okay?:::['6-4-335']
now, don't hold back.:::['6-4-336']
we're just celebrating that joey got his health insurance back.:::['6-4-339']
oh, all right.:::['6-4-340', '6-2-300', '2-22-311']
okay. aah.:::['6-6-0']
listen, i'm gonna be moving out, so you are gonna be in charge of paying the rent.:::['6-6-1']
right, and when is that due? first of the month.:::['6-6-2']
and that's every month?:::['6-6-3']
no, just the months you actually want to live here.:::['6-6-4']
okay, here's the phone bill.:::['6-6-6']
that's our phone number.:::['6-6-8']
look, i know i kind of sprung this whole me-moving-out-on-you thing.:::['6-6-9']
so why don't i just cover you for a while? no, no. no way.:::['6-6-10']
joey tribbiani does not take charity......anymore.:::['6-6-11']
it's not charity, joe. no, forget it.:::['6-6-12']
okay? i mean, thanks, but i'm done taking money from you.:::['6-6-13']
all right? i can take care of myself. now, what's next? come on.:::['6-6-14']
okay, uh, here's the electric bill.:::['6-6-15']
this is how much we pay for electric? well, yeah.:::['6-6-16']
chandler: so we'll do the rest of the bills later, then?:::['6-6-17']
so is joey gonna have to give up the apartment?:::['6-6-18']
i hope not. i tried to offer him money, but he wouldn't take it.:::['6-6-19']
how much do you think he needs?:::['6-6-20']
i figure $1500 would cover him for a few months, you know......but i have to trick him into:::['6-6-21']
taking it so i don't hurt his pride.:::['6-6-22']
yeah. well, why don't you hire him as an actor?:::['6-6-23']
you could have him dress up and put on little skits whenever you want.:::['6-6-24']
well, that would help the pride thing.:::['6-6-25']
hey. chandler: hey.:::['6-6-26', '6-3-47', '1-21-139', '9-20-46', '10-16-93', '4-10-0', '3-21-77']
wow, you look great. do you wanna move in with me tomorrow?:::['6-6-27']
what do you girls have planned for tonight?:::['6-6-29']
instead of being sad that tonight's my last night with rachel......we thought we'd go out and celebrate::::['6-6-30']
rachel's moving in with phoebe.:::['6-6-31']
and also my birthday. ha, ha. it's not your birthday.:::['6-6-32']
what a mean thing to say.:::['6-6-33']
i would never tell you it was not your birthday.:::['6-6-34']
hey, so you guys have anything planned for the big last night?:::['6-6-36']
well, instead of just hanging out, we figure we'd do nothing.:::['6-6-37']
whoa, whoa, whoa. knicks' season opener tonight.:::['6-6-38']
i thought maybe you guys would come and watch it.:::['6-6-39']
i don't know, ross.:::['6-6-40']
not if you talk about how you gave up basketball......to become a paleontologist.:::['6-6-41']
i did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.:::['6-6-42']
pheebs, i was wondering... you're not dressed yet?:::['6-6-43']
we're supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!:::['6-6-44']
well, and clearly, not a minute sooner.:::['6-6-45']
rachel, you are packed, though, right? i mean, please tell me you're packed.:::['6-6-46']
of course i'm packed. monica, relax.:::['6-6-47']
i wanted to ask phoebe for her opinion on what i should wear.:::['6-6-48']
my god, i cannot get a minute of peace.:::['6-6-49']
monica's just gonna kill you.:::['6-6-51']
what you're wearing is fine for that.:::['6-6-53']
you're not packed!:::['6-6-54']
you're not packed even a little bit.:::['6-6-55']
surprise.:::['6-6-56']
don't get mad, because, look, this is what happened.:::['6-6-57']
so i started packing, and then i realized, "what am i doing?":::['6-6-58']
i am lousy at packing, right?:::['6-6-59']
but you love packing.:::['6-6-60']
so as a gift to you on our last night...:::['6-6-61']
ta-da.:::['6-6-62']
i'll be coordinator.:::['6-6-63']
oh, my god, i'm so sorry. i didn't get you anything.:::['6-6-64']
look, everybody has to help. phoebe, you can help, can't you?:::['6-6-66']
i have plans.:::['6-6-67']
you have plans with us. that's right.:::['6-6-68']
all right. chandler can make boxes, ross can wrap, and joey can lift things.:::['6-6-69']
tell the guys they have to help out. okay.:::['6-6-70']
monica: okay. my god, thank you.:::['6-6-71']
hurry! monica's gonna make you pack. she's got jobs for everyone.:::['6-6-72']
now, it's too late for me, but save yourselves.:::['6-6-73']
monica: okay.:::['6-6-74', '9-5-207', '10-9-203', '3-23-156']
the movers will be here in 11 hours. rachel has not packed.:::['6-6-75']
now, everybody has to help. chandler...:::['6-6-76']
no, i have plans with joey.:::['6-6-77']
i thought you said you were doing nothing. yes, but for the last time.:::['6-6-78']
okay, fine. now, ross...:::['6-6-79']
oh, but i can't do it. why not?:::['6-6-80']
don't you have ben? because i have ben.:::['6-6-81']
it's almost 8:00, it's almost past his bedtime. where is he?:::['6-6-82']
he's at a dinner party.:::['6-6-83']
is he really coming? because i can see into your apartment.:::['6-6-84']
of course he is. uh, what?:::['6-6-85']
you think i'd just use my son as an excuse?:::['6-6-86']
what kind of father do you think i am?:::['6-6-87']
all right. sorry.:::['6-6-88']
i gotta go make a fake ben.:::['6-6-89']
here it is. our last pizzas together as roommates.:::['6-6-90']
i wish i'd known you were gonna do that. i ordered chinese.:::['6-6-91']
oh. oh, that's okay.:::['6-6-92']
hey, actually, in a way it's kind of nice. you know?:::['6-6-93']
our last dinner together. me, bringing the food of my ancestors......you, the food of yours.:::['6-6-94']
say, joe, i had a strange idea for what to do on our last night.:::['6-6-96']
what do you say we play a little, uh, foosball for money?:::['6-6-97']
are you crazy? you haven't beaten me once since my injury-plagued '97 season.:::['6-6-98']
it'd be easier if you'd just give me your money.:::['6-6-99']
yes, it would.:::['6-6-100']
ahem. what do you say to $50?:::['6-6-101']
okay, you're on. okay, let's play.:::['6-6-102']
the big game. italy versus......china, apparently.:::['6-6-103']
oh, look, it's the rollerblades.:::['6-6-104']
you remember when we got these?:::['6-6-106']
oh, i guess you weren't there.:::['6-6-108']
you guys, we said we were gonna have fun.:::['6-6-109']
come on. hey, ha, ha, remember the time?:::['6-6-110']
you don't remember?:::['6-6-111']
sorry, pheebs. i guess i'm just really sad that i'm leaving.:::['6-6-112']
i'm gonna miss you so much.:::['6-6-113']
well, this doesn't have to be so sad though, you know?:::['6-6-114']
instead of thinking about how much you're gonna miss about each other......you should, like, think about:::['6-6-115']
some of the things you're not gonna miss.:::['6-6-116']
i don't think there's anything.:::['6-6-117']
come on, there's gotta be something.:::['6-6-118']
nope. she's perfect.:::['6-6-119']
i have one.:::['6-6-120']
good. great. okay, you can go first.:::['6-6-121']
uh, well, i guess i'm not gonna miss the fact......that you're never allowed:::['6-6-122']
to move the phone pen. ha, ha.:::['6-6-123']
that's a good one. okay, monica, anything?:::['6-6-124']
you know, does rachel move the phone pen?:::['6-6-125']
aw, sometimes. ha, ha.:::['6-6-126']
always, actually.:::['6-6-127']
good. there you go. doesn't everyone feel better?:::['6-6-128']
it's not just the phone pen.:::['6-6-129']
it's just that i never get my messages.:::['6-6-130']
you get your messages.:::['6-6-131']
well, i don't think it counts if you have to read them off your hand......after you've fallen asleep:::['6-6-132']
on the couch.:::['6-6-133']
so you missed a message from who? chandler?:::['6-6-134']
or your mom?:::['6-6-135', '6-6-137']
or chandler?:::['6-6-136']
great, it worked. no one's sad. heh.:::['6-6-138']
yes. ah.:::['6-6-139']
i win again. ha, ha, that's, like, 500 bucks you owe me. woo-hoo!:::['6-6-140']
man. five hundred dollars.:::['6-6-141']
that is a lot of electricity, huh? woo-hoo!:::['6-6-142']
ooh, i gotta buy some food.:::['6-6-143']
okay, okay. give me a chance to win my money back. sudden death......one goal, $1000.:::['6-6-144']
you serious? oh, yes.:::['6-6-145']
get ready to owe me. okay.:::['6-6-147']
okay, here we go. ready?:::['6-6-148']
no, no, no! no, no, no!:::['6-6-149']
no one can beat me.:::['6-6-150']
see, now that's why only the little fake men are supposed to do the kicking.:::['6-6-151']
oh, hi, ross. see, other people call me.:::['6-6-153']
ooh, your brother. score.:::['6-6-154']
thought we'd say hi.:::['6-6-156']
put him on. ben, say hi to aunt monica.:::['6-6-157']
oh, i guess he doesn't feel like talking right now.:::['6-6-158']
uh, he's smiling, though.:::['6-6-159']
okay, talk to you later.:::['6-6-160']
i think it was better when you guys were sad.:::['6-6-161']
hey, oh, remember the rollerblades? oh.:::['6-6-162']
you know what else i'm not gonna miss? "i'm monica.:::['6-6-163']
i wash the toilets 17 times a day, even if people are on it.":::['6-6-164']
"hi, i'm rachel. is my sweater too tight? no?:::['6-6-165']
oh, i'd better wash it and shrink it.":::['6-6-166']
"i'm monica. i don't get phone messages from interesting people. ever.":::['6-6-167']
hey, i call her.:::['6-6-168']
"oh, my god. i love ross. i hate ross. i love ross. i hate ross.":::['6-6-169']
"oh, my god. i can't find a boyfriend.:::['6-6-170']
so i guess i'll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy i find in there.":::['6-6-171']
yeah, we should get a move on if we want to make those dinner reservations.:::['6-6-172']
still broken?:::['6-6-173']
it sucks, man.:::['6-6-174']
your last night here, and i lose the two most important things::::['6-6-175']
the foosball table......and $500.:::['6-6-176']
well, you know, there are other ways you can win back your money.:::['6-6-177']
how about blackjack? ah, not my game.:::['6-6-178']
okay, uh, you know what? we can play a new game.:::['6-6-179']
a new game. it's fun. what's it called?:::['6-6-180']
cups.:::['6-6-181', '5-18-116']
i don't know how to play cups. i'll teach you. it's really easy and fun.:::['6-6-182']
all right. okay, here you go.:::['6-6-183']
i have two queens. what do you have?:::['6-6-184']
a two and a five. whoa, you win. fifty dollars.:::['6-6-185']
really? oh, yeah. okay, let's play again. ready?:::['6-6-186']
ooh!:::['6-6-187', '9-14-102', '9-14-209', '7-22-64', '7-12-52', '10-10-217', '10-9-74', '5-2-333', '4-12-184']
what have you got? a four and a nine.:::['6-6-188']
you're kidding, right?:::['6-6-189']
no. why? well, that's a full cup.:::['6-6-190']
damn, i am good at cups.:::['6-6-191']
i'm not talking to her.:::['6-6-192']
one of you has to take the first step......and it should be you because:::['6-6-193']
she's the one who's leaving.:::['6-6-194']
it's harder for her.:::['6-6-195']
maybe you're right.:::['6-6-196']
but she made fun of my phone pen.:::['6-6-197']
i know. i took it hard too.:::['6-6-198']
listen, rachel, i feel bad about what happened...:::['6-6-199']
what are you doing? i'm unpacking.:::['6-6-200']
what? i'm not moving. is that picture straight?:::['6-6-201']
it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left.:::['6-6-202']
hey, you know what?:::['6-6-203', '5-20-270']
you're the one who wants this big change and move in with chandler.:::['6-6-204']
you should go. why do i have to leave?:::['6-6-205']
because it's my apartment! well, it's mine too. what else you got?:::['6-6-206']
how about: you're moving!:::['6-6-207']
rachel: no, no, no. monica: yes, yes, yes.:::['6-6-208']
okay, monica...:::['6-6-209']
this is ridiculous.:::['6-6-210']
we should be packing you.:::['6-6-211']
phoebe: hey, how you guys doing? rachel: great. monica's moving.:::['6-6-212']
i am not!:::['6-6-213']
oh, really? well, how come all your stuff is in this box?:::['6-6-214']
okay, you guys, you guys, i think i know what's going on here.:::['6-6-215']
okay? you guys? stop!:::['6-6-216']
i know that you're acting mad because you think that will make it easier to leave.:::['6-6-217']
but deep down, you're still really sad. deep, deep down.:::['6-6-218']
no, phoebe, i am mad! well, deep, deep, deep down.:::['6-6-219']
yeah, i'm just mad.:::['6-6-220']
then keep running.:::['6-6-221']
you win.:::['6-6-222']
what did you have? doesn't matter. nothing beats......a three and a six.:::['6-6-223']
that, my friend, is "d cup.":::['6-6-224']
okay, now, how much have you won so far?:::['6-6-225']
wow. seven hundred. not 700 exactly?:::['6-6-226']
yeah. heh. double it.:::['6-6-227']
what? yeah, see, in cups, once you get $700......you have to double it.:::['6-6-228']
really? hey, i didn't make up the rules.:::['6-6-229']
okay, so now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get, uh, one card.:::['6-6-230']
now, that one card could be worth $100, which brings your total to 1500.:::['6-6-231']
ooh. no, no, no.:::['6-6-232']
don't get too excited, because that's not gonna happen unless you get the... no way.:::['6-6-233']
well, this is the last box of your clothes.:::['6-6-234']
i'm just gonna label it "what were you thinking?":::['6-6-235', '10-10-276']
funny, i was just gonna go across the hall and write that on chandler.:::['6-6-236', '10-10-277']
okay, you guys, i don't mean to make things worse, but......i don't wanna live:::['6-6-237', '10-10-278']
with rachel anymore.:::['6-6-238', '10-10-279']
both: what? you're just so mean to each other.:::['6-6-239', '10-10-280']
and i don't wanna end up like that with rachel. i still like you.:::['6-6-240', '10-10-281']
well, phoebe, that's fine because i'm not moving.:::['6-6-241', '10-10-282']
whoa, whoa, whoa. phoebe, you gotta take her.:::['6-6-242', '10-10-283']
you know, i know i said some bad stuff......but rachel does have some qualities:::['6-6-243']
that make her a good roommate.:::['6-6-244', '10-10-285']
oh, really? like what, monica?:::['6-6-245']
you know how she has 147,000 pair of boots?:::['6-6-246']
oh, yeah, good start, mon.:::['6-6-247']
she lets you borrow them. yeah.:::['6-6-248']
and you stretch them out with your big old clown feet.:::['6-6-249']
do you wanna live outside? because it's getting cold.:::['6-6-250']
she gets tons of catalogs......and, um, she'll fold down the pages:::['6-6-251', '10-10-286']
of the things she thinks i'd like.:::['6-6-252', '10-10-287']
what else? uh...:::['6-6-253', '10-10-288']
when i take a shower......she leaves me little notes:::['6-6-254', '10-10-289']
on the mirror.:::['6-6-255', '10-10-290']
yeah, i do. i do do that.:::['6-6-256', '10-10-291']
that's nice. i like having things to read in the bathroom.:::['6-6-257', '10-10-292']
when i fall asleep on the couch after reading......she covers me over with a blanket.:::['6-6-258', '10-10-293']
well, you know, i don't want you to be cold.:::['6-6-259', '10-10-294']
and when i told her i was gonna be moving in with chandler......she was really supportive.:::['6-6-260']
you were so great.:::['6-6-261', '10-10-296']
you made it so easy.:::['6-6-262', '10-10-297']
and now you have to leave.:::['6-6-263', '10-10-298']
and i have to live with a boy!:::['6-6-264', '10-10-299']
it's gonna be fine.:::['6-6-265']
okay, rachel. now i can't wait to live with you.:::['6-6-266']
you know what we should do?:::['6-6-267']
bring monica, and then we can all live there together.:::['6-6-268']
we'll have so much fun!:::['6-6-269']
but, honey, i think she's moving in with chandler.:::['6-6-270']
oh, that's right.:::['6-6-271', '7-13-50', '4-2-44']
you're still set on that?:::['6-6-272']
kind of.:::['6-6-273', '7-4-168']
hello? hey, mon.:::['6-6-275', '5-4-187']
how's the packing going?:::['6-6-276']
ben? he's fine. yeah, he's right... oh, my god.:::['6-6-277']
get your head out of your shirt there, son.:::['6-6-278']
yeah, it's a pumpkin. i'll come pack.:::['6-6-280']
what's wrong? ross and i were helping the girls pack......took a little break.:::['6-6-282']
i lost $1500 to him in cups.:::['6-6-283']
wha...? how did you lose at cups?:::['6-6-284']
the same way you lost.:::['6-6-285']
i started out with the king and the queen. bam. ross gets a two and a three.:::['6-6-286']
then i get a jack and a king. boom. ross gets a four and five.:::['6-6-287']
even ross was getting the cup card, the d cup......the sitting-down bonus. meanwhile,i didn't even get a half cup. nothing.:::['6-6-288']
he never played before either.:::['6-6-290']
you know what i think? i think beginner's luck, very important in cups.:::['6-6-291']
let's just play one more hand. one more hand.:::['6-6-292']
no, no more. i cannot lose another dime. i'm serious this time.:::['6-6-293']
in fact, look. there's... i wanna give you something, okay?:::['6-6-294']
and let me give it to you now before i pawn it for cups money.:::['6-6-295']
now, i want you to have the big, white dog......as a... kind of a thank-you for being:::['6-6-296']
such a great roommate.:::['6-6-297']
i can't take the big, white dog. you love it.:::['6-6-298']
it's "him." not "it.":::['6-6-299']
well, what if i bought it from you, you know?:::['6-6-300']
and then your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price.:::['6-6-301']
say $1500?:::['6-6-302']
wait a second. i see what you're trying to do here.:::['6-6-303']
you're trying to give me money again.:::['6-6-304']
when did i try to give you money?:::['6-6-305']
before, over there with the bills.:::['6-6-306']
you tried to give me charity, i said no, you dropped it.:::['6-6-307']
okay, then we had a nice last night together.:::['6-6-308']
we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money.:::['6-6-309']
now, out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again.:::['6-6-310']
i'm just trying to help you out, okay? i wanna make sure that you're okay.:::['6-6-311']
i will be okay. look, chandler.:::['6-6-312']
you gotta get it out of your head that i can't take care of myself, okay?:::['6-6-313']
look, i'm not gonna miss you helping me out with money.:::['6-6-314']
the only thing i'm gonna miss......is you.:::['6-6-315']
and now the dog.:::['6-6-316']
monica: hey.:::['6-6-317']
call me when you get there, okay? okay.:::['6-6-318']
i'm really gonna miss you.:::['6-6-319', '1-21-304']
oh, i have your key.:::['6-6-320']
here you go. thanks.:::['6-6-321', '10-2-311', '10-14-34', '5-12-293', '3-18-145']
oh, god, this is silly. i'm gonna see you in a couple of hours.:::['6-6-322']
bye, house.:::['6-6-323']
bye-bye. bye.:::['6-6-324']
she really left. i know.:::['6-6-326', '10-10-301']
thank you. no problem, roomie.:::['6-6-327', '10-10-302']
can i ask you a question? sure.:::['6-6-328', '10-10-303']
what the hell is that dog doing here?:::['6-6-329', '10-10-304']
i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money.:::['6-6-330']
and now you want that money back? exactly.:::['6-6-331']
chandler, what kind of idiot do you take me for?:::['6-6-332']
it's not a real game. i made it up.:::['6-6-333']
i'm sorry you lost your money. but i won it fair and square.:::['6-6-334']
at a fake game!:::['6-6-335']
now, if you wanna try to make some of it back......i'd be glad to play you for it.:::['6-6-336']
but i should warn you.:::['6-6-337']
i am very good at cups.:::['6-6-338']
okay, now, i assume the saucer card came up when you played last?:::['6-6-339']
no. hmm.:::['6-6-340']
let's see if it comes up this time.:::['6-6-341']
ready? okay. yeah.:::['6-7-0']
hi. rachel. phoebe's. it's. and.:::['6-7-1']
please. leave.:::['6-7-2']
leave.:::['6-7-3', '1-9-141']
but i just said "leave.":::['6-7-4']
yeah, i know, because you have all the good words.:::['6-7-5']
what do i get? i get "it's, and." oh, i'm sorry, i have "a." forget it.:::['6-7-6']
come on, that's silly. all right. so let's switch.:::['6-7-7']
no, i have all the good words.:::['6-7-8']
okay, fine, fine. we can switch.:::['6-7-9']
hi. everybody.:::['6-7-11']
it's. rachel.:::['6-7-12']
and. phoebe's.:::['6-7-13']
pleas... wait. how did you do that?:::['6-7-14']
oh, you're no ordinary roommate, are you?:::['6-7-16']
phoebe, come on, can we finish this later? i wanna go running before it gets dark.:::['6-7-17']
why don't you come with me? really?:::['6-7-18']
yeah, oh, it'll be fun.:::['6-7-19']
we'll run in the park. it'll be like our first, you know, roommate-bonding thing.:::['6-7-20']
okay, let's go running!:::['6-7-21']
yeah, and there's cute guys there. let's run towards them!:::['6-7-22']
wait just one more second.:::['6-7-24']
hi, it's phoebe and rachel's. please leave a message. thanks!:::['6-7-25']
now, wait a minute. you just took all the words.:::['6-7-26']
uh-huh. you've met your match, rachel green.:::['6-7-27']
so i just finished this fascinating book. hmm.:::['6-7-28']
by the year 2030, there'll be computers......that can carry out the same amount:::['6-7-29']
of functions as an actual human brain.:::['6-7-30']
so, theoretically, you could download......your thoughts and memories:::['6-7-31']
into this computer......and live forever as a machine.:::['6-7-32']
and i just realized i can sleep with my eyes open.:::['6-7-33']
hey. both: hey.:::['6-7-34', '10-7-19', '4-13-32']
honey, it was a great idea, nailing the boxes to the floor.:::['6-7-35']
i didn't nail the boxes to the floor. oh, so you can move them.:::['6-7-36']
yes, and while i'm doing that, ross has a great computer story for you.:::['6-7-38']
hey, everybody. uh, i'd like you to meet janine.:::['6-7-39']
she's gonna be my new roommate.:::['6-7-40']
hi. janine: hi.:::['6-7-41']
and she's gonna live with me!:::['6-7-42']
it's nice to meet you. janine?:::['6-7-43']
lecroix. janine lecroix.:::['6-7-44']
i didn't know that. what a pretty last name.:::['6-7-45']
so, uh, where are you from?:::['6-7-46']
australia. i just moved here a couple of weeks ago.:::['6-7-47']
from the land down under? yeah.:::['6-7-48']
i didn't know that either.:::['6-7-49']
so, what do you do?:::['6-7-50']
i'm a dancer. you're a dancer?:::['6-7-51']
she's a dancer.:::['6-7-52']
well, i think i'll go and unpack. here, let me...:::['6-7-53']
joey? joey: yeah?:::['6-7-54']
did you even interview this woman before you asked her to move in?:::['6-7-55']
of course i did. uh-huh.:::['6-7-56']
what exactly did you ask her?:::['6-7-57']
when can you move in?:::['6-7-58']
thank you for bringing her into our lives.:::['6-7-59']
oh. oh, so you like her too, chandler?:::['6-7-61']
hey, look at all the boxes.:::['6-7-62']
i cannot wait to ask her out.:::['6-7-63']
wait a minute, joey. joey, you can't ask her out.:::['6-7-64']
she's your roommate. it'll be way too complicated.:::['6-7-65']
yeah, man, don't do it.:::['6-7-66']
i mean, if you date her, then i can't date her.:::['6-7-67']
think about it. remember when you were going out with donna and you broke up......remember how horrible it was when:::['6-7-68']
you bumped into her at the supermarket?:::['6-7-69']
oh, god, yeah.:::['6-7-70']
now imagine you live at the supermarket.:::['6-7-71']
no, no. oh. oh.:::['6-7-73']
you're right. i don't want that. i can't date her.:::['6-7-74']
and you'd better watch the flirting too, because in close quarters......it could be trouble.:::['6-7-75']
well, that's gonna be tough, mon.:::['6-7-76']
i mean, it's hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt.:::['6-7-77']
heh. well, you're around me all the time, and you don't flirt.:::['6-7-78']
a little sad about that, sweetie?:::['6-7-79']
i have to tie my shoes, so you go ahead. i'll catch up.:::['6-7-80']
okay. phoebe: okay.:::['6-7-81', '1-3-193', '5-19-80']
come on, that's not running. let's go!:::['6-7-82']
you guys, i'm telling you, when she runs......she looks like a cross:::['6-7-83']
between kermit the frog......and the six million dollar man.:::['6-7-84']
monica had such a crush on him. ha, ha.:::['6-7-85']
she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed.:::['6-7-86']
i used to do that too.:::['6-7-87']
oh, my god. did you also have his album, it's not easy being green?:::['6-7-88']
oh, mon.:::['6-7-89']
so phoebe runs weird, huh?:::['6-7-90']
yeah. and you know what? and i know she's gonna want to run again.:::['6-7-91']
i don't know how to get out of it. i mean, i live with her.:::['6-7-92']
why don't you just be straight with her? tell her the truth.:::['6-7-93']
you're right. you're right. i should just tell her the truth.:::['6-7-94']
hey. ross & monica: hey.:::['6-7-95']
hey, pheebs, monica tripped me. i don't think i can ever run again, ever.:::['6-7-96']
why? why would you do that?:::['6-7-97', '5-9-333']
rachel, i'm sorry that i hurt your ankles.:::['6-7-99']
ankle. we'll see.:::['6-7-100']
chandler: okay. i am officially unpacked.:::['6-7-101']
thanks for helping me, man.:::['6-7-102']
well, i guess joey went home.:::['6-7-104']
oh, and look, there is still one box that i have to unpack.:::['6-7-105']
i got you.:::['6-7-106']
oh, my god, you almost gave me a heart attack.:::['6-7-107']
it was so hard not to laugh, i'll tell you.:::['6-7-108']
hey, the place looks great.:::['6-7-109']
yeah, not bad, right?:::['6-7-110']
you know what? monica's working late, so i'm gonna make this place spotless.:::['6-7-111']
you know what else i'm gonna do?:::['6-7-112']
i'm gonna go downstairs, i'm gonna get her some flowers.:::['6-7-113']
now, who would not want to live with me?:::['6-7-114']
i don't.:::['6-7-115', '1-15-63']
no, i want to live with the super-hot australian dancer.:::['6-7-116']
how's that going, though? are you okay with the not-flirting thing?:::['6-7-117']
yeah, so far. yeah. but it's tough, you know?:::['6-7-118']
i've got all this built-up flirting energy, and i don't know how to get rid of it.:::['6-7-119']
sorry. there's just more room out here.:::['6-7-122']
oh, no, no, you just, uh, reminded me that i have to do my stretches too.:::['6-7-123']
why don't you try to be? aah!:::['6-7-124']
what's wrong? uh, nothing.:::['6-7-125']
i just... i didn't want you to touch me......because i'm all sweaty:::['6-7-126']
from the workout. ha, ha.:::['6-7-127']
i'm gonna hit the shower.:::['6-7-128']
oh, sorry about that stuff hanging in there.:::['6-7-130']
it's just my thongs are too delicate for the dryer.:::['6-7-131']
rachel: aah! phoebe: hi.:::['6-7-132']
oh, yeah, uh-huh, it's me.:::['6-7-133']
i saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.:::['6-7-134']
you lied so you could run by yourself.:::['6-7-135']
no, phoebe, no. i was... no.:::['6-7-136']
i was actually just checking......to see......if i could run. and i can.:::['6-7-137']
please, rachel, i'm not an idiot.:::['6-7-138']
no, wait. phoebe?:::['6-7-139']
wow. couples who live together do start to look alike.:::['6-7-140']
so, mondler...:::['6-7-141']
what, uh...? what are you doing?:::['6-7-143']
what does it look like? i am cleaning.:::['6-7-144']
did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?:::['6-7-145']
authorizat... i don't need that. i'm gonna put everything back.:::['6-7-146']
put it back exactly where you found it?:::['6-7-147']
yes. i'm gonna put it back exactly where i found it.:::['6-7-148']
okay, first of all, that attitude is not helping.:::['6-7-149']
she won't care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place.:::['6-7-150']
hello? did you just meet monica?:::['6-7-151']
she's gonna recognize that i did a nice thing......and appreciate it.:::['6-7-152']
huh. no, actually, this will work out well.:::['6-7-153']
because when you have to move back with joey......joey's hot new roommate:::['6-7-154']
can come live with me.:::['6-7-155']
oh, i see, i see. you're trying to freak me out.:::['6-7-156']
look, chandler, monica is really weird about this kind of stuff, all right?:::['6-7-157']
believe me, i lived with her for 16 years. she's going to freak out.:::['6-7-158']
oh, my god. she's going to sit on you.:::['6-7-159']
no, she is not, okay? i'll prove it to you.:::['6-7-160']
i'm gonna call her right now.:::['6-7-161']
phone's done.:::['6-7-162']
monica: hi. hey, mon. how's it going?:::['6-7-163']
terrible. if i want something done right, i have to do it myself.:::['6-7-164']
other people just wreck stuff.:::['6-7-165']
i really think i might kill someone tonight.:::['6-7-166']
oh, come on, come on, it can't be that bad.:::['6-7-167']
it's worse. the only thing getting me through......is knowing i'm gonna see you soon.:::['6-7-168']
i might get out of here early. no. no, no, no.:::['6-7-169']
no, no, it sounds like they need you there.:::['6-7-170']
you're just hanging out with ross? it's all good. okay, bye, mon.:::['6-7-171']
she's gonna kill me.:::['6-7-172']
the phone was facing the other way.:::['6-7-173']
and that goes back up there.:::['6-7-174']
know what we should do? we should start with the big stuff.:::['6-7-175']
that'll be the easiest. so, uh, let's start with the couch.:::['6-7-176']
i got it.:::['6-7-177', '10-10-211', '5-16-25', '4-8-273', '4-12-175', '4-23-64']
yeah, that doesn't look right.:::['6-7-178']
what are you talking about? the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet.:::['6-7-179']
then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on...:::['6-7-180']
okay, here's what we do.:::['6-7-181']
we just move the couch closer to the coffee table.:::['6-7-182']
but then the back of the couch won't line up with the back of the carpet.:::['6-7-183']
okay, well, here, we'll just, uh, move the coffee table......closer to the couch.:::['6-7-184']
no, whoa, whoa! but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area.:::['6-7-185']
but the coffee table doesn't match the table... ross.:::['6-7-186']
hi. look, what am i gonna do?:::['6-7-187']
i'm not flirting, but still i'm drawing her to me like a moth to a flame.:::['6-7-188']
what the hell's going on over here?:::['6-7-189']
monica's gonna kill you.:::['6-7-190']
look, i need your help, okay?:::['6-7-191']
i have to do something to repel this woman.:::['6-7-192']
wait a minute. wait a minute.:::['6-7-193', '8-13-176']
you guys repel women all the time.:::['6-7-194']
hey, i've been married three times.:::['6-7-195']
no, no, no, i've seen it happen.:::['6-7-196']
you get a rapport going with a woman, but somehow you manage to kill it.:::['6-7-197']
what's your secret?:::['6-7-198']
look, we do not repel women, okay?:::['6-7-199']
oh, yes, we do, my man.:::['6-7-201']
remember back in college when we went to that dance......and you walked right up to that girl:::['6-7-202']
you liked and couldn't stop talking......about the irish potato famine?:::['6-7-203']
yeah, well, what about you? you weren't so hot in college either.:::['6-7-204']
after everything he said, he'd go::::['6-7-205']
yeah, monica doesn't like that either. maybe i should stop doing that.:::['6-7-206']
you know what? girls don't like it when i start talking about science.:::['6-7-207']
that's not specific to girls.:::['6-7-208']
this is great. this is great. what else?:::['6-7-209']
they don't like you correcting their grammar.:::['6-7-210']
and they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.:::['6-7-211']
you know, they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you.:::['6-7-212']
man, i am so lucky i have monica. i'm never gonna find love again.:::['6-7-213']
phoebe, can i talk to you for a second? sure.:::['6-7-215']
okay. um, i...:::['6-7-216']
phoebe, look, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry, okay?:::['6-7-217']
i handled the situation horribly.:::['6-7-218']
and i should not have lied to you.:::['6-7-219']
so what should you have done?:::['6-7-220']
well, i should have told you the truth.:::['6-7-221']
uh-huh. which is?:::['6-7-222']
well, you know, the reason that i didn't want to go running with you is......because, um......well, you know, the way that you run:::['6-7-223']
is just a little...:::['6-7-224']
so? well, it's embarrassing.:::['6-7-225']
people were looking at us like we were crazy.:::['6-7-226']
why do you care? because they're people.:::['6-7-227']
but people that you don't know and will never see again.:::['6-7-228']
yes, but still they are people......with eyes.:::['6-7-229']
well, i didn't get embarrassed running next to miss::::['6-7-230']
choo, choo, choo, choo.:::['6-7-231']
but, oh, okay.:::['6-7-232']
no, no, i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.:::['6-7-233']
yeah, okay. you're uptight.:::['6-7-234']
what? i am not uptight. whoa.:::['6-7-235']
listen, i am not uptight, man.:::['6-7-236']
that's okay, rachel. i'm not judging you. that's just who you are.:::['6-7-237']
me, i'm more free, you know? i run like i did when i was a kid......because that's the only way it's fun,you know?:::['6-7-238']
i mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs would fall off......you know, like, when you were:::['6-7-239']
running towards the swings......or running away from satan?:::['6-7-240']
the neighbor's dog.:::['6-7-241']
okay, is this lamp in the right place?:::['6-7-242']
who cares? i repel women.:::['6-7-243']
no, no, no! you can't come in here.:::['6-7-244']
ross is naked!:::['6-7-245']
monica: what? what?:::['6-7-246']
i couldn't say that i was naked, because she's allowed to see me naked.:::['6-7-247']
why does anyone have to be naked?:::['6-7-248']
monica: why is ross naked?:::['6-7-249']
i had to show chandler something.:::['6-7-250']
monica: naked?:::['6-7-251']
yeah, i uh...:::['6-7-252']
i guess i have, a, uh...:::['6-7-253']
a guy problem.:::['6-7-254']
monica: is it the same thing that chandler had?:::['6-7-255']
look, just come back later.:::['6-7-256']
we'll get everything squared away, and you can come back later.:::['6-7-257']
monica: okay. hey, listen.:::['6-7-258']
there's still some of chandler's medicine left under the sink in the bathroom.:::['6-7-259']
dude, what'd you have?:::['6-7-262']
look, we have no time, okay? we must focus.:::['6-7-263']
we've got to get everything back into its original place.:::['6-7-264']
the photo album.:::['6-7-265']
there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album.:::['6-7-266']
we just go through it and match everything to the pictures.:::['6-7-267']
that's perfect. that's brilliant. yeah.:::['6-7-268']
so really, what did you have?:::['6-7-269']
hey, joey. i've got some beer for you.:::['6-7-270']
uh, don't you mean "for whom"?:::['6-7-271']
listen, i was gonna order some pizza. you wanna share one?:::['6-7-273']
pizza? it's not like i never had that before.:::['6-7-274']
is there something wrong?:::['6-7-275']
all right, all right.:::['6-7-276', '1-23-278']
let's just get this out in the open, okay?:::['6-7-277']
you're hot.:::['6-7-278']
i'm lovable.:::['6-7-279']
clearly, there's a vibe going on between us.:::['6-7-280']
but we're roommates......and it's a huge mistake for us:::['6-7-281']
to continue down this road.:::['6-7-282']
joey... no, no, no. i'm telling you.:::['6-7-283']
imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you'll understand.:::['6-7-284']
okay? so the question is, what do we do?:::['6-7-285']
well, i don't think there is anything to do.:::['6-7-286']
i mean, i think you're really sweet.:::['6-7-287']
but i'm just not interested in you like that.:::['6-7-288']
no, i mean...:::['6-7-290', '1-24-213']
you're a really nice guy, and i'm happy to be your roommate and your friend.:::['6-7-291']
i'm just, you know, i just......don't feel that way about you.:::['6-7-292']
i see what happened. ha, ha.:::['6-7-294']
it's because i was trying to repel you.:::['6-7-295']
right? believe me, you'd feel a lot different if i turned it on.:::['6-7-296']
i don't think so. oh, i do.:::['6-7-297', '8-19-288']
oh, dear god.:::['6-7-301', '8-21-13', '9-5-18', '2-24-259']
choo, choo, choo.:::['6-7-302']
rachel: hey! phoebe: hi!:::['6-7-303']
i'm so sorry. you're right. this feels great.:::['6-7-304']
see? and you don't care if people are staring.:::['6-7-305']
it's just for a second, because then you're gone.:::['6-7-306']
it's amazing, pheebs. i feel so free and so graceful.:::['6-7-307']
ha! hey, look out for the horse.:::['6-7-309']
sorry.:::['6-7-310', '1-22-194', '1-19-216', '1-16-124', '1-3-100', '1-3-104', '1-15-9', '1-10-62', '1-12-11', '8-18-96', '8-8-146', '9-11-228', '9-13-99', '9-14-151', '10-17-397', '2-10-258', '2-15-137', '2-15-306', '2-18-139', '2-23-112', '2-23-289', '2-6-206', '5-7-143', '5-13-20', '4-1-250', '3-18-28', '3-21-201', '3-3-57', '3-4-301']
is it okay for me to come in now?:::['6-7-311']
why is everything different? bye.:::['6-7-313']
i don't see anything different......other than the fact that the room got:::['6-7-314']
so much brighter when you came into it.:::['6-7-315']
well, the end table is wrong, the couch looks bizarre......and don't even get me started:::['6-7-316']
on the refrigerator magnets.:::['6-7-317']
okay, look, don't be mad, okay?:::['6-7-318']
but after i unpacked the boxes, i wanted to do something nice for you......so i cleaned the apartment.:::['6-7-319']
so i moved everything around, and then i forgot......where it went back. and i'm sorry,i'm very sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry.:::['6-7-320']
that's okay.:::['6-7-321', '1-14-94', '2-1-285', '5-23-28', '3-19-224', '3-16-26']
chandler, are you afraid of me or something?:::['6-7-322']
do you want me to be afraid of you?:::['6-7-323']
my gosh, chandler, what you did is a wonderful thing......and i really appreciate it.:::['6-7-325']
i know i have this thing where i want everything in the perfect place.:::['6-7-326']
but i'd never expect you to worry about that.:::['6-7-327']
oh, you're the best.:::['6-7-330']
you come here to me.:::['6-7-331']
hold on, okay? first things first.:::['6-7-332']
okay. now...:::['6-7-333']
did ross sit anywhere while he was naked?:::['6-7-334']
so it said that by the year 2030......there will be computers carrying:::['6-7-335']
out the same number of functions......as an actual human brain.:::['6-7-336']
so theoretically, you could download your thoughts......and your memories:::['6-7-337']
into this computer...:::['6-7-338']
and live forever as a machine.:::['6-7-339']
uh, so, janine, do you know what we're doing right now?:::['6-7-340']
you and i, we're interfacing.:::['6-7-341']
yeah. i gotta go.:::['6-7-342']
hey. hey, check it out. this is unbelievable.:::['6-3-0']
joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes.:::['6-3-1', '8-19-89']
are you trying to kill me?:::['6-3-2']
pheebs, i wanna ask you something. uh-huh, what?:::['6-3-3']
um, well, since i'm moving out and you're so beautiful......how about i move in with you?:::['6-3-4']
well, that would be great, but then what do we do about denise?:::['6-3-5']
who's denise? my roommate.:::['6-3-6']
you have a roommate? yes, denise. denise.:::['6-3-7']
hey, what is with the secrecy, phoebe? huh?:::['6-3-8']
and what about this denise? she cute?:::['6-3-9']
how can you have a roommate that none of us know about?:::['6-3-10']
maybe because you never listen to anything i say.:::['6-3-11']
i talk about her all the time. denise!:::['6-3-12']
rach, i was thinking, i'm gonna have an extra room over at my place.:::['6-3-13']
oh, that's true. why don't you move in with me?:::['6-3-14']
it'll be great. we can stay up late talking, watch movies.:::['6-3-15']
and you know about naked thursdays, right?:::['6-3-16']
yeah, yeah, i think i'm gonna find my own place.:::['6-3-17']
hey, hey. i thought naked thursdays was just our thing, man.:::['6-3-18']
what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?:::['6-3-20']
oh, that. um, she took it really well.:::['6-3-21']
oh. you didn't tell her, did you? no.:::['6-3-22']
because you're in love with her. i am not in love with her.:::['6-3-23']
she was very upset about having to move out.:::['6-3-24']
so i didn't tell her we were still married, because she'd only get more upset.:::['6-3-25']
i comforted her. as a friend.:::['6-3-26']
what do you mean, "comforted her"? it was nothing. i gave her a hug.:::['6-3-27']
aha. a classic sign of love, the hug.:::['6-3-28']
it's also a sign of friendship.:::['6-3-29']
yeah, not in your case, lovey loverson.:::['6-3-30']
it was a hug.:::['6-3-31']
just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?:::['6-3-32']
smell her hair? well, what if i did?:::['6-3-33']
ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out the top of her head.:::['6-3-34']
that's why women are shorter.:::['6-3-35']
so that men will fall in love when they hug them.:::['6-3-36']
come on, ross, you're a scientist.:::['6-3-37']
i was hugging her as a friend, okay?:::['6-3-38']
it's not my fault her hair got in my face.:::['6-3-39']
she's got a lot of it, and it smells all, uh......you know, coconutty.:::['6-3-40']
what? oh. it doesn't mean i have feelings for rachel.:::['6-3-41']
maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts.:::['6-3-42']
okay, whatever you say. but just be careful. rachel's not in the same place you are.:::['6-3-43']
okay, if the place you're referring to is being in love......then she is in the same place as me,because i am not in that place.:::['6-3-44']
okay, i didn't understand that.:::['6-3-45']
but maybe that's because you were speaking the secret language of love.:::['6-3-46']
dude, some guy just called for you. who was it?:::['6-3-48']
how about "thanks for taking the message"? jeez.:::['6-3-50']
hey, listen.:::['6-3-51']
when you move in, rachel's room's gonna be empty.:::['6-3-52']
you wanna talk about what we wanna do with it?:::['6-3-53']
i think we should have a beautiful guest room......with a mahogany sleigh bed:::['6-3-55']
and bedside tables with flowers on them.:::['6-3-56']
then we could have a rolltop desk with comment cards......so people can tell us:::['6-3-57']
how much they love staying here.:::['6-3-58']
whatever, you know, i really haven't thought about it that much.:::['6-3-59']
well, i like that idea, obviously. ha, ha.:::['6-3-60']
but i was thinking maybe it could be a game room, you know?:::['6-3-61']
i mean, you can buy old arcade games......like "space invaders":::['6-3-62']
and "asteroids" for $200.:::['6-3-63']
the real ones. the big, big, big ones.:::['6-3-64']
okay, so you mean "no" as in, "gee, chandler, what an interesting idea.:::['6-3-66']
let's discuss it before we reject it completely.":::['6-3-67']
oh. i'm sorry. of course.:::['6-3-68']
yes. interesting idea, um, talk about it, but no.:::['6-3-69']
so that's it?:::['6-3-70']
well, i just don't think that arcade games go in the beautiful guest room.:::['6-3-71']
the guest room's gonna be filled with antiques.:::['6-3-72']
which is why "asteroids" is perfect. it's the oldest game.:::['6-3-73']
what do you have against the guest room?:::['6-3-74']
i don't have anything against the guest room.:::['6-3-75']
especially since everybody that we know lives about 30 seconds away.:::['6-3-76']
are you mocking me?:::['6-3-77']
no, i'm not mocking you or your beautiful guest room.:::['6-3-78']
joey: what's up?:::['6-3-79']
nothing. monica and i had a stupid fight.:::['6-3-80']
but you're still moving in together, right? because my ad came out today.:::['6-3-81']
"wanted: female roommate, nonsmoker, nonugly.":::['6-3-82', '6-3-97']
nice. ah?:::['6-3-83']
i figured after living with you......it'd be an interesting change:::['6-3-84']
to have a female roommate.:::['6-3-85']
you know? someone i could learn from. someone who's different than me.:::['6-3-86']
and what's more different than me, a guy who's not 19......than, say, a girl who is 19?:::['6-3-87']
ah? ha, ha.:::['6-3-88']
not just a hat rack, my friend.:::['6-3-89']
pheebs, i have to ask you... shh. i'm swamped right now.:::['6-3-90']
you're just staring into space.:::['6-3-91']
um, i'm trying to move that pencil.:::['6-3-92']
this one? it worked!:::['6-3-93']
pheebs, this whole apartment thing is a nightmare.:::['6-3-94']
every place that i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak.:::['6-3-95']
look at this.:::['6-3-96', '1-15-232', '7-13-290', '2-3-169']
it's just there's nothing. this city is full. phoebe: wait, no, look at this.:::['6-3-98']
"two-bedroom, two-bath. must be nonsmoker.:::['6-3-99']
satan worshipers okay.":::['6-3-100']
oh. yeah, but it's on the ground floor.:::['6-3-101']
hey. rachel: hey.:::['6-3-102', '7-10-16', '5-2-123', '5-16-285']
rach, are you still looking for a place? yeah, why?:::['6-3-103']
okay, there's this guy warren from the museum......and he's going on a dig:::['6-3-104']
for like two years.:::['6-3-105']
and he's got this great place he needs to sublet.:::['6-3-106']
so you interested?:::['6-3-107']
that sounds great. i'd love to live at warren's. i love warren.:::['6-3-108']
thank you. oh, don't thank me.:::['6-3-109']
you wanna thank someone, thank the volcano......that erupted thousands of years ago......killing but perfectly preserving:::['6-3-110']
an entire civilization.:::['6-3-111']
here's warren's number.:::['6-3-112']
oh, this is great. i am gonna call him right now.:::['6-3-113']
oh, okay. oh. rachel: thank you. ha, ha.:::['6-3-114']
okay, you go call him.:::['6-3-115']
i saw it.:::['6-3-116']
i don't know what you're talking about.:::['6-3-117', '7-6-133', '10-11-255']
i'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit.:::['6-3-118']
you know, that you love her again. you relove her.:::['6-3-119']
look, i do not relove her.:::['6-3-120']
i can't believe you won't just admit it.:::['6-3-121']
okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.:::['6-3-122']
look, we're just friends now, okay? why would i do anything stupid?:::['6-3-123']
ugh. well, the apartment is already subletted.:::['6-3-124']
i mean, this is just hopeless. i'm never gonna find anything.:::['6-3-125']
you can live with me.:::['6-3-126']
rachel: oh, my god, are you serious? uh-huh.:::['6-3-129']
i would love to live with you, ross. that's great. thank you.:::['6-3-130']
i'm just glad i could, you know, help you out.:::['6-3-131']
wow, i'm so happy for you guys. this is so, so not stupid.:::['6-3-132']
ross, ross, you have no idea what this means to me.:::['6-3-133']
i mean, i was gonna be homeless. you've just saved me. you're my hero.:::['6-3-134']
hero? i don't know. well, all right.:::['6-3-135']
oh. i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has.:::['6-3-136']
aw. mwah. oh, please.:::['6-3-137']
you're gonna say things now, aren't you?:::['6-3-138']
no. no, i won't.:::['6-3-139']
but i should tell you this.:::['6-3-140']
this exact same thing happened to my roommate, denise.:::['6-3-141']
she moved in with a guy......who was secretly married to her:::['6-3-142']
and said he didn't love her but really did.:::['6-3-143']
it just blew up.:::['6-3-144']
and that's how she ended up living with me.:::['6-3-145']
okay, that's a lie.:::['6-3-146']
hi. listen, i'm sorry about before. i don't need to have a game room.:::['6-3-148']
when i was a kid, i only played those games because i couldn't get girls.:::['6-3-149']
now i can get...:::['6-3-150']
now i have you.:::['6-3-151']
no, not that i think that i have you......or think of you as property:::['6-3-152']
in any sort of way.:::['6-3-153']
i see women... stop it, chandler.:::['6-3-154']
i'm sorry too.:::['6-3-155', '9-23-569', '9-21-361', '10-6-342']
really? yeah. oh, yes.:::['6-3-156']
listen, we don't have to make that a guest room.:::['6-3-158']
we can think of something together. that's a great idea.:::['6-3-159']
we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.:::['6-3-160']
we don't have to come up with this now. oh, good.:::['6-3-162']
why don't we think about changes that we can make in the living room?:::['6-3-163']
changes?:::['6-3-164']
yeah, i mean, we're gonna have to move some furniture to make room for my chair.:::['6-3-165']
you're gonna bring the barcalounger over here?:::['6-3-166']
is that a problem? well...:::['6-3-167']
it's just that they're a set and they should probably stay together.:::['6-3-168']
oh, that's cool. then i'll just bring them both over.:::['6-3-169']
see, now you're taking them away from their home.:::['6-3-170']
okay, i get it. so i get nothing. nothing here is mine. everything is yours.:::['6-3-171']
i'll get up in the morning, put on your clothes, and head off to work.:::['6-3-172']
yeah. yeah, you know what? that's it. that's it.:::['6-3-173']
everything will be mine. nothing will be yours.:::['6-3-174']
oh, come on. i'm talking about the barcalounger.:::['6-3-175']
it doesn't match. where is it gonna go?:::['6-3-176']
in the game room.:::['6-3-177']
look, it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly.:::['6-3-178']
that's fine. i won't bring over the chairs. i won't bring anything over.:::['6-3-179']
i wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance over here at grandma's place!:::['6-3-180']
everything on your application looks really good.:::['6-3-181']
oh, just one last question.:::['6-3-182']
are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time partying?:::['6-3-183']
oh, don't worry. i'm not really a party girl.:::['6-3-184']
now, don't just be blurting stuff out.:::['6-3-186']
i want you to really think about your answers.:::['6-3-187']
you can call off the roommate search. hi. i'll be living here.:::['6-3-188']
oh, don't listen to him.:::['6-3-189']
he's just some guy who wants the apartment.:::['6-3-190']
but i don't think he's gonna get it.:::['6-3-191']
why did you take the shower curtain down?:::['6-3-192']
that thing was a hazard.:::['6-3-193']
i'm very safety-conscious.:::['6-3-194']
oh, i was just clearing some space for your stuff.:::['6-3-196']
oh, thanks.:::['6-3-197', '7-1-69']
but listen, i was just at monica's......and she and chandler had a big fight:::['6-3-198']
and they're not moving in.:::['6-3-199']
what do you mean, not moving in? they're still moving in, right?:::['6-3-200']
no, no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.:::['6-3-201']
what? over a stupid room?:::['6-3-202']
i feel kind of bad for them......but i'm also psyched:::['6-3-203']
because i don't have to move in here.:::['6-3-204']
oh, no. yeah. no, that part's great.:::['6-3-205']
what's all this about you guys fighting?:::['6-3-206']
is this really over a room?:::['6-3-207']
i mean, that is so silly.:::['6-3-208']
ross, we can handle this. well, apparently not.:::['6-3-209']
and i can't just stand by and watch two people i care about so much......be hurt by something that is so silly.:::['6-3-210']
i mean, enough of the silliness. why don't you tell her to stop being silly?:::['6-3-211']
two very good points.:::['6-3-213']
look, i've known you both a long time.:::['6-3-214']
and i've never seen either of you one-millionth as happy......as you've been since you got together.:::['6-3-215']
do you really wanna throw that all away over a room?:::['6-3-216']
that is so silly.:::['6-3-217']
what's more important, love......or silliness?:::['6-3-218']
well, we are fond of the silliness.:::['6-3-219']
but we also have a soft spot for the love.:::['6-3-220']
love is the best medicine. that's laughter.:::['6-3-221']
why do you do it? i don't know.:::['6-3-222']
now, chandler, you wanna live with monica, right?:::['6-3-223']
yeah, i do.:::['6-3-224', '1-1-201', '7-12-39', '3-18-44', '3-11-200']
and, mon, you wanna live with chandler, don't you?:::['6-3-225']
good. a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york.:::['6-3-227']
so i understand you're looking for a place?:::['6-3-228']
no, no, i'm staying put. oh.:::['6-3-229']
i was going to offer you my apartment.:::['6-3-230']
why? where are you going?:::['6-3-231']
hey, rach. hi.:::['6-3-233']
uh, you're never gonna believe it. monica and chandler are moving in again.:::['6-3-234']
that's great news, right? i mean, for them, right?:::['6-3-235']
oh, wow.:::['6-3-236', '6-2-147', '9-11-34', '10-11-138', '2-9-289', '2-18-210', '4-13-127', '4-13-263', '4-18-17', '3-21-320', '3-13-217', '3-7-258']
but on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.:::['6-3-237']
yeah. you know, about that, um...:::['6-3-238']
ross, ahem, i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything......but don't you think:::['6-3-239']
it's gonna be weird?:::['6-3-240']
why? why? why would it...? why would it be weird?:::['6-3-241']
well, you know, because of us.:::['6-3-242']
because of our history.:::['6-3-243']
no. rachel: no?:::['6-3-244']
no, no.:::['6-3-245', '1-14-129', '1-12-312', '8-1-212', '8-9-163', '7-21-59', '2-8-188', '2-15-251', '2-14-96', '3-14-274']
it would only be weird if we were still in that place.:::['6-3-246']
i mean, are you still in that place?:::['6-3-247']
no, not at all. good. me neither.:::['6-3-248']
so it's not a problem.:::['6-3-249']
we're just two friends who happen to be roommates.:::['6-3-250']
okay, but, ross, eventually, you and i are gonna be dating.:::['6-3-251']
really? we are?:::['6-3-252']
well, yeah. i'm gonna have a boyfriend and you're gonna have a girlfriend.:::['6-3-253']
oh. heh.:::['6-3-254', '8-12-154', '9-7-121']
that'd be great.:::['6-3-255', '3-6-133']
but if you think it's gonna be okay, we'll just work out a system.:::['6-3-256']
it'll be like in college. i'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign::::['6-3-257']
"come back later. i'm getting lucky.":::['6-3-258']
yeah, i didn't think of that.:::['6-3-259']
so are you sure about this whole moving-in thing?:::['6-3-260']
i mean, it's a really big step. and what's the rush?:::['6-3-261']
that's very funny.:::['6-3-262']
he's being silly because he knows we enjoy the silliness.:::['6-3-263']
no, i'm serious, okay? i mean, think about it.:::['6-3-264']
you move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms......next thing you know, you break up.:::['6-3-265']
ross, you were right before. it was just a stupid fight about a room.:::['6-3-266']
okay, there are no stupid fights.:::['6-3-267']
this isn't about the room.:::['6-3-268']
this is about what the room represents.:::['6-3-269']
and unfortunately, this room could destroy you.:::['6-3-270']
yeah, i'm not so worried. yeah, no, me neither.:::['6-3-271']
fine. it's your life.:::['6-3-272']
i just don't wanna see you break up.:::['6-3-273']
which you will do if you move in together.:::['6-3-274']
but if that's what you want, there's nothing i can do.:::['6-3-275']
don't do it!:::['6-3-276']
you still wanna move in together, right? of course.:::['6-3-277']
ross didn't scare you?:::['6-3-278']
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.:::['6-3-279']
come here, i gotta show you something. okay.:::['6-3-280']
oh, my god, someone's killed square man.:::['6-3-281']
this is where the barcalounger could go.:::['6-3-282']
you see, you can see the tv, and still, it's walking distance to the kitchen.:::['6-3-283']
i wanna show you something.:::['6-3-285']
you know those big road signs that say "merge"?:::['6-3-286']
you know? so i was thinking we could get one of those signs......and hang it over our bed.:::['6-3-288']
because that's you and i together.:::['6-3-289']
"merge.":::['6-3-290']
oh, my god, i love that. really?:::['6-3-291']
"no.":::['6-3-292']
i found you in my bed:::['6-3-293']
how'd you wind up there?:::['6-3-294']
you are a mystery:::['6-3-295']
little black curly hair:::['6-3-296', '6-3-298']
little black, little black little black, little black:::['6-3-297']
um...:::['6-3-300', '1-9-8', '1-9-140', '1-8-19', '1-20-286', '1-24-52', '1-1-194', '1-12-189', '1-12-194', '1-12-329', '8-2-146', '8-18-189', '8-24-88', '8-21-12', '8-8-49', '9-21-213', '9-7-164', '9-13-152', '7-7-268', '7-2-30', '7-13-134', '10-1-50', '10-17-454', '2-22-252', '5-3-60', '5-3-66', '5-1-325', '5-13-78', '5-12-312', '4-9-224', '4-12-138', '4-23-252', '3-18-314', '3-9-25', '3-23-195', '3-13-84', '3-13-281']
if you wanna receive e-mails about my upcoming shows......then please give me money:::['6-3-301']
so i can buy a computer.:::['6-3-302']
so, uh... ahem.:::['6-3-303']
where are the other guys?:::['6-3-304']
well, let's see, monica and chandler are occupied.:::['6-3-305']
fighting? no, the other thing.:::['6-3-306']
i really think it's great they worked things out.:::['6-3-307']
yeah, there's no breaking them up, is there?:::['6-3-308']
hey, can i borrow the key to your house so i can make a copy?:::['6-3-309']
now, are you sure?:::['6-3-311']
because once i make a copy, there's no turning back.:::['6-3-312']
yeah, i'm sure.:::['6-3-313', '10-2-352']
now get out of here before i change my mind.:::['6-3-314']
uh, listen, ross.:::['6-3-315']
you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea?:::['6-3-316']
i've been back and forth.:::['6-3-317']
yeah, well, maybe you should go back, okay?:::['6-3-318']
rachel moves in, and before you know it......you're where you don't wanna be,back together.:::['6-3-319']
yeah, i don't think so.:::['6-3-320']
she's already talking about, you know, dating other guys.:::['6-3-321']
that's not gonna work out.:::['6-3-322']
then she's gonna come home all weepy, and you'll be telling her::::['6-3-323']
"oh, that's okay. you'll find someone.":::['6-3-324']
and then, bam, she finds you.:::['6-3-325']
huh. oh, maybe you're right.:::['6-3-326']
i am telling you, ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again.:::['6-3-327']
now, is that what you want?:::['6-3-328']
heh. is that what i want?:::['6-3-329']
here she comes. i'm gonna make your life much easier.:::['6-3-330']
all right, well, the place was closed, so i'll copy it later.:::['6-3-331']
or not.:::['6-3-332', '7-5-77']
uh, rach, why don't you just move in with me?:::['6-3-333']
ahh. oh.:::['6-3-334']
whoa, whoa, joey. no, no, no. it's okay.:::['6-3-335']
look, rach, i know i scared you off with that whole naked-thursdays thing......but we don't have to do that.:::['6-3-336']
well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall.:::['6-3-337']
wait a minute, unless you're thinking about naked wednesdays.:::['6-3-338']
thursday's clearly not good for you. pick a day.:::['6-3-339']
come on in. thanks for coming back.:::['6-3-341']
okay, there have been a lot of people interested in the room.:::['6-3-342']
but i have narrowed it down, and you are one of the finalists.:::['6-3-343']
great. okay, now, before i make my decision......i just wanna make sure:::['6-3-344']
that our personalities match, okay?:::['6-3-345']
so i made up a little test.:::['6-3-346']
now, i'm gonna say a word, and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.:::['6-3-347']
i can do that. okay, here we go.:::['6-3-348']
pillow. fight.:::['6-3-349']
very good.:::['6-3-350', '7-6-179', '7-16-246']
okay. g.:::['6-3-351']
string? excellent.:::['6-3-352']
doggy.:::['6-3-354']
kitten? ooh, sorry.:::['6-3-355']
no, no, no. so close, though. but, you know, okay, bye-bye.:::['6-3-356']
hi. hey.:::['6-2-0', '8-3-259', '8-13-172', '8-17-74', '8-20-0', '9-3-46', '9-2-160', '7-5-191', '7-4-224', '4-16-104', '4-20-115', '4-1-11', '3-18-281', '3-8-27', '3-20-212', '3-14-214', '3-7-86', '3-6-77']
so, uh, did everything go okay with the annulment?:::['6-2-1']
oh, yeah. no problems. it's all taken care of.:::['6-2-2', '6-1-307']
ross, thank you. ah.:::['6-2-3']
you guys want to go see a movie? yeah, why not?:::['6-2-4']
let me get my sweater. ross: okay.:::['6-2-5']
want to hear something weird?:::['6-2-6']
always.:::['6-2-7', '6-1-314']
i didn't get the annulment.:::['6-2-8', '6-1-315']
what? we're still married.:::['6-2-9', '6-1-316']
don't tell rachel. see you later.:::['6-2-10', '6-1-317']
hey, do you have any gum? oh, yeah.:::['6-2-11']
wait! wait! hi. ross, can i just talk to you for just a second?:::['6-2-12']
oh, but we'll be late for the movie.:::['6-2-13']
oh, there's a cab. taxi!:::['6-2-14']
what timing! my god, huh? there you go.:::['6-2-16']
we're gonna walk. it's right at the angelika.:::['6-2-17']
oh, the angelika! go! go!:::['6-2-18']
you didn't get the annulment?:::['6-2-19']
i know. ross!:::['6-2-20']
i tried, but when i got to my lawyer's office, all i heard was::::['6-2-21']
"three divorces! three divorces!":::['6-2-22']
i just don't want my tombstone to read "ross geller: three divorces.":::['6-2-23']
don't worry about that. your tombstone can say whatever you want.:::['6-2-24']
it can say, "ross geller: good at marriage.":::['6-2-25']
you know? mine's gonna say, "phoebe buffay: buried alive.":::['6-2-26']
all i know is, i can't have another failed marriage.:::['6-2-27']
so you're gonna be married to a girl who doesn't even know about it?:::['6-2-28']
woman. sorry.:::['6-2-29']
well, okay, so i don't have it all worked out quite yet.:::['6-2-30']
just don't say anything to rachel. rachel is one of my closest friends.:::['6-2-31']
but being the only one that knows about this makes me feel special. okay.:::['6-2-32']
okay, stop, stop! phoebe?:::['6-2-33']
hey, rach!:::['6-2-34']
what was that?:::['6-2-35', '1-21-176', '10-7-194', '2-21-175', '4-4-205', '4-5-137', '3-12-275']
sorry. mix-up.:::['6-2-36']
how was the movie?:::['6-2-37']
i haven't seen it yet.:::['6-2-38']
you'd better hurry. the angelika! go. go!:::['6-2-39']
when we move in together, can i get a gumball machine?:::['6-2-41']
of course. joey wouldn't let you have one?:::['6-2-42']
no, when it comes to sweets, he's surprisingly strict.:::['6-2-43']
did you tell him you're moving out?:::['6-2-44']
no, i keep trying. and i can get out "joey, i have to...":::['6-2-45']
then i lose my nerve and i finish with "...go to the bathroom.":::['6-2-46']
he may think i'm sick.:::['6-2-47']
i have to tell rachel, but i... we just gotta get it over with.:::['6-2-48']
next time we see them, we'll just tell them. that's it.:::['6-2-49']
that's how it'll work now? you'll just order me around?:::['6-2-50']
pretty much. all right.:::['6-2-51']
hey, monica. hey, man, you feeling better?:::['6-2-52']
monica: joey.:::['6-2-53']
we have something to tell you.:::['6-2-54']
you're pregnant!:::['6-2-56']
no! no?:::['6-2-57']
no. no!:::['6-2-58', '3-10-114']
look, joe, here's the thing. um...:::['6-2-59']
monica and i have decided to live together, here.:::['6-2-60']
so i'm gonna be moving out, man.:::['6-2-61']
oh, uh, hey!:::['6-2-63']
i'm really happy for you guys. congratulations. see you later.:::['6-2-64']
joey! joey! are you okay? yeah.:::['6-2-65']
i gotta go. i've got an acting job.:::['6-2-66']
like you'd believe that.:::['6-2-67']
this sucks!:::['6-2-68', '4-10-247']
i'll be across the hall. and i promise you......the minute monica and i break up,i'm moving right back in.:::['6-2-69']
look, uh, if you're gonna move in with him......i feel it is my responsibility:::['6-2-70']
to tell you the truth about him.:::['6-2-71']
he's a terrible roommate. terrible.:::['6-2-72']
he, uh, forgets to, um...:::['6-2-73']
he always, he always, uh...:::['6-2-74']
who am i kidding? he's the best roommate!:::['6-2-75']
hey, pheebs. have you seen rachel? hey.:::['6-2-76']
no, why? i have some exciting news.:::['6-2-77']
you're pregnant.:::['6-2-78']
chandler and i are moving in together.:::['6-2-80', '6-2-85']
oh, that's good!:::['6-2-81']
but if you were pregnant, what would you name it? hint, phoebe.:::['6-2-82']
what's up? well, um...:::['6-2-84']
oh, my little sister and my best friend......shacking up.:::['6-2-87']
that's great. that's great. mwah.:::['6-2-88']
guys, i'm happy too. okay, come here.:::['6-2-89']
big day, huh? people moving in. people getting annulled.:::['6-2-90']
i gotta go find rachel. but, um...:::['6-2-91']
if you see her, give her some really bad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad.:::['6-2-92']
okay, bye.:::['6-2-93', '6-2-204', '5-20-97', '5-20-121', '4-1-243']
hmm. something bad to tell rachel.:::['6-2-94']
bad news for rachel. what could that be?:::['6-2-95']
can you just lay off, please?:::['6-2-96']
my life is an embarrassment. i should just go live under somebody's stairs.:::['6-2-97']
it's not that big a deal. you'll have been divorced three times.:::['6-2-98']
you'll have a life, you'll date...:::['6-2-99']
no, i won't. i'll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now.:::['6-2-100']
the only guys below me will be four-divorce guy......uh, murderer guy......and geologists.:::['6-2-101']
ross, you're being ridiculous. you are cute and smart and sweet.:::['6-2-102']
that is much more important than three stupid divorces.:::['6-2-103']
have you dated anyone who's been divorced three times?:::['6-2-104']
that's not fair. most guys that have been divorced three times are 60.:::['6-2-105']
nobody cares about this except you.:::['6-2-106']
this embarrassment thing is all in your head.:::['6-2-107']
here, i'll show you. come here. what?:::['6-2-108']
hi. my friend ross is about to be divorced for the third time.:::['6-2-109']
but wouldn't you date him?:::['6-2-110']
and if you wait right here, i'll go get ross.:::['6-2-111']
hey. agh. thought you were rachel.:::['6-2-112']
what gave me away? i gotta tell her.:::['6-2-113']
get it over with. i told ross and phoebe. she's the only one left.:::['6-2-114']
it's official. we're moving in together.:::['6-2-115']
no turning back.:::['6-2-116']
are you scared? are you?:::['6-2-117']
that was my scariest voice. you're brave.:::['6-2-119']
hey. ugh. chandler & monica: hey.:::['6-2-120']
the worst day.:::['6-2-121']
you're finally making progress at work, then your boss calls you racquel.:::['6-2-122']
first four years of my work, they called me...:::['6-2-123']
seriously. i believe you.:::['6-2-124']
it was in the middle of a meeting, so no one wants to correct her.:::['6-2-125']
so everyone's calling me racquel.:::['6-2-126']
by the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me rocky.:::['6-2-127']
well, i still think you're very, very nice and very pretty.:::['6-2-128']
all yours, babe.:::['6-2-130']
have a seat.:::['6-2-132', '10-12-230', '4-6-96']
listen, um, chandler and i......are going to live together.:::['6-2-134']
here.:::['6-2-135', '1-4-227', '8-3-121', '8-24-137', '8-22-204', '7-22-76', '7-5-81', '10-8-264', '5-20-259', '5-6-315', '3-22-90', '3-5-142']
that's so great!:::['6-2-137']
i'm so happy for you guys!:::['6-2-138']
and that was so sweet of you to ask.:::['6-2-140']
the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!:::['6-2-141']
yes, we are.:::['6-2-142', '4-10-312']
chandler, you'll have to watch those long showers you take......because you know:::['6-2-143']
racquel can't be late.:::['6-2-144']
rach. he'll work on that.:::['6-2-145']
oh. aw, this is so exciting!:::['6-2-146']
come and knock on our door:::['6-2-148']
we'll be waiting for you:::['6-2-149']
see? once you know the stories, it's not that bad.:::['6-2-150']
first marriage: wife's hidden sexuality. not my fault.:::['6-2-151']
second marriage: said the wrong name at the altar.:::['6-2-152']
a little my fault.:::['6-2-153']
third marriage: they shouldn't let you get married......when you're drunk:::['6-2-154']
and have writing on your face.:::['6-2-155']
nevada's fault.:::['6-2-156']
so, what do you think, ladies? who wouldn't want to date him?:::['6-2-157']
the divorces don't bother me. i'd date him.:::['6-2-158']
but not while he's still married.:::['6-2-159']
and you, wouldn't you want a date?:::['6-2-160']
i'm not dating at all anymore.:::['6-2-161']
i was only dating guys that were bad for me.:::['6-2-162']
so i decided that until i work that...:::['6-2-163']
good. good. whatever.:::['6-2-164']
what about you, meg?:::['6-2-165']
well, i don't care about the divorces either.:::['6-2-166']
but i wouldn't date him.:::['6-2-167']
it's just that he's obviously still in love with this rachel girl.:::['6-2-168']
she said, "he's obviously still in love with this rachel girl.":::['6-2-170']
this is crazy. i mean, yes, rachel is my good friend.:::['6-2-171']
and i have loved her in the past......but now, she is just my wife.:::['6-2-172']
phoebe, will you help me out here?:::['6-2-173']
well, i thought you loved her when you married her.:::['6-2-174']
we were drunk! i would've married joey with that amount of alcohol.:::['6-2-175']
hey! you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani!:::['6-2-176']
i'm sorry, but you guys are wrong.:::['6-2-177']
i just don't want to be divorced three times.:::['6-2-178']
yes, and now he's using this three-divorces reason......because he wants to stay married:::['6-2-179']
to her because he loves her.:::['6-2-180']
i must say, well done. bravo, meg.:::['6-2-181']
okay, fine. if this is what you think......forget about the whole:::['6-2-182']
three-divorce thing.:::['6-2-183']
i'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled. okay?:::['6-2-184']
she means nothing to me.:::['6-2-185']
noth... nothing!:::['6-2-186']
okay, now i wouldn't date you because you seem a little creepy.:::['6-2-187']
i am so attracted to him right now.:::['6-2-188']
when will we tell rachel what actually will happen?:::['6-2-189']
soon.:::['6-2-190', '5-3-101']
i just couldn't before. you saw how upset joey got.:::['6-2-191']
i couldn't do it. she's my best friend.:::['6-2-192']
joey's my best friend.:::['6-2-193']
i'm not your best friend?:::['6-2-194']
you just said...!:::['6-2-195']
of course, you're my best friend.:::['6-2-197']
would you tell rachel?:::['6-2-198']
all right. at least i'm prepared. okay.:::['6-2-199']
oh, yes. hey!:::['6-2-200']
hey, hey.:::['6-2-201', '8-16-266']
they're not for you. are you upset? i am now.:::['6-2-202']
hey, roomie.:::['6-2-203', '8-20-238']
rach. ahem.:::['6-2-205']
there's something, um, important i have to tell you.:::['6-2-206']
are you pregnant?:::['6-2-207']
no, but i'm throwing this shirt away.:::['6-2-208']
i think there was a little misunderstanding before.:::['6-2-209']
mm-hm. um...:::['6-2-210']
when i said that, uh, chandler and i wanted to live together......we meant alone together.:::['6-2-211']
oh, my god. that's funny. i can't believe i did that.:::['6-2-212']
no, sweetie. you know what? this is my fault.:::['6-2-213']
i wasn't clear.:::['6-2-214']
i'm really sorry.:::['6-2-215']
listen, you take as much time as you need to move out, okay?:::['6-2-216']
there's absolutely no rush.:::['6-2-217']
don't you want a cookie?:::['6-2-219']
do you need a tissue?:::['6-2-222']
where did you get these? i made them.:::['6-2-224']
oh, god, they're so yummy!:::['6-2-225']
it's gonna be weird when i come home and you're not here.:::['6-2-226']
no more joey and chan's.:::['6-2-227']
no more j and c's.:::['6-2-228']
want to go to joey and chandler's? can't. it's not there.:::['6-2-229']
i'll be across the hall. we can still do all the same stuff.:::['6-2-230']
we won't be able in the night and have those long talks......about our feelings and the future.:::['6-2-231']
not once did we do that.:::['6-2-232']
hi. chandler & joey: hey.:::['6-2-233', '4-17-172']
so i told rachel that it's just gonna be the two of us.:::['6-2-234']
oh, yeah? well, how'd she take it?:::['6-2-235']
really well. yeah.:::['6-2-236']
surprisingly well.:::['6-2-237']
she didn't cry. she wasn't angry or sad.:::['6-2-238']
and you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?:::['6-2-239']
all i'm asking for is a little emotion.:::['6-2-240']
is that too much to ask after six years?:::['6-2-241']
what, are rachel and i not as close as you guys?:::['6-2-242']
i mean, did we not have as much fun? don't i deserve a few tears?:::['6-2-243']
when we told joey, he cried his eyes out.:::['6-2-244']
hey! i did not cry my eyes out!:::['6-2-245']
come on, it's like the end of an era.:::['6-2-246']
no more j-man and channy's!:::['6-2-247']
okay, i gotta ask, who calls us that?:::['6-2-248']
you got married again?:::['6-2-249']
so that's your second marriage in two years?:::['6-2-251']
yes. second in two years.:::['6-2-252']
third, overall.:::['6-2-253']
i have been a divorce attorney for 23 years......and never have i had:::['6-2-254']
so much business from one client.:::['6-2-255']
why don't you tell me what happened?:::['6-2-256']
basically, rachel and i were in vegas, and we got drunk.:::['6-2-257']
i'm sorry, is this the same rachel whose name you said......at the altar:::['6-2-258']
in the second marriage?:::['6-2-259']
yes, yes, yes. heh.:::['6-2-260']
but i do not love her.:::['6-2-261']
that's better then.:::['6-2-263']
this was just a drunken mistake, and i need to get it annulled.:::['6-2-264']
i see.:::['6-2-265', '1-6-274', '7-22-249', '10-15-81', '2-12-309', '4-10-171']
have you considered therapy?:::['6-2-266']
i think just the annulment for today.:::['6-2-267']
there are some forms to fill out. easy.:::['6-2-268']
we'll need witnesses who can testify that you were not of sound mind.:::['6-2-269']
no problem. heh.:::['6-2-270']
we'll need you and rachel to testify before a judge.:::['6-2-271']
there's no way to do this without her?:::['6-2-273']
because i kind of already told her it was taken care of.:::['6-2-274']
of course you did.:::['6-2-275']
look, you can't get an annulment unless you and rachel are both there.:::['6-2-276']
what about someone who looks like rachel?:::['6-2-278']
i will think about the therapy.:::['6-2-279']
so, um, i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.:::['6-2-281']
no point in dragging it out.:::['6-2-283']
dragging out the long process of you moving out......and us not living together anymore.:::['6-2-284']
hey, rach. yeah?:::['6-2-286']
what about this? who gets this?:::['6-2-287']
i don't know if i want it because it might be too many memories.:::['6-2-288']
what is that? i don't know.:::['6-2-289']
how about this? i want you to have the big plate.:::['6-2-291']
wow, monica, thanks. i love this plate.:::['6-2-292']
something to remember me by.:::['6-2-293']
mon, you're not dying. i'm just moving out.:::['6-2-294']
we're gonna see each other all the time.:::['6-2-295']
but still, it's a big change.:::['6-2-296']
the end of an era, you might say.:::['6-2-297']
are you okay? you're not blinking.:::['6-2-298']
i'm fine. i was thinking about how it's an end of an era.:::['6-2-299']
but i gotta say, i don't think six years counts as an era.:::['6-2-301']
an era is defined as a significant period of time.:::['6-2-302']
it was significant for me. maybe it wasn't significant to you!:::['6-2-303']
what is the matter with you? what is the matter with you?:::['6-2-304']
why aren't you more upset?:::['6-2-305']
aren't you gonna be sad that we're not living together?:::['6-2-306']
aren't you gonna miss me at all?:::['6-2-307']
monica, all right. but don't get mad at me.:::['6-2-308']
it's just a little hard to believe.:::['6-2-309']
what's hard to believe?:::['6-2-310']
i mean, it's you guys. you do this kind of stuff, you know?:::['6-2-311']
you were gonna get married in vegas, and then you backed out.:::['6-2-312']
i'm not upset because i don't see you going through with it. i'm sorry.:::['6-2-313']
it's going to happen.:::['6-2-315']
chandler is gonna move in here.:::['6-2-316']
but i... no, wait. just let me finish, okay?:::['6-2-317']
this isn't something that we just impulsively decided to do in vegas.:::['6-2-318']
this is something that we both really want.:::['6-2-319']
and it is going to happen.:::['6-2-320']
yeah, sweetie.:::['6-2-323']
you mean, we're not gonna live together anymore?:::['6-2-324']
well...:::['6-2-326', '6-1-279', '1-3-161', '1-2-34', '1-5-240', '8-12-110', '9-19-326', '9-22-303', '9-21-308', '9-2-9', '9-4-290', '9-17-181', '7-21-78', '7-4-173', '7-15-307', '7-13-138', '10-1-216', '10-10-101', '2-13-105', '2-4-112', '2-4-179', '5-19-37', '5-9-337', '5-2-196', '5-12-324', '4-17-198', '4-24-193', '3-6-99']
oh, my god. i'm gonna miss you so much.:::['6-2-327']
i'm gonna miss you.:::['6-2-328', '8-7-172', '4-8-297']
i mean, it's the end of an era!:::['6-2-329']
phoebe: okay, bye. oh, no.:::['6-2-331']
so did you get the annulment?:::['6-2-332']
i couldn't. i knew it. because you love rachel.:::['6-2-333']
it's not that. annulments are more complicated...:::['6-2-334']
complicated because of the love.:::['6-2-335']
i do not love rachel.:::['6-2-336']
i'm telling her about the whole thing......so we can get this marriage:::['6-2-337']
annulled as fast as possible.:::['6-2-338']
would i do that if i loved her?:::['6-2-339']
i've never been more convinced of your love for her.:::['6-2-340']
i do not have feelings for rachel, okay?:::['6-2-341']
oh, what's wrong?:::['6-2-342']
monica and chandler are moving in here......and i have to move out:::['6-2-343']
and everything is changing.:::['6-2-344']
oh, my, come here, come here. it's okay.:::['6-2-345']
aw, everything's gonna be okay.:::['6-2-346']
so ross and rachel got married.:::['6-2-349']
monica and chandler almost got married.:::['6-2-350']
you think you and i should hook up?:::['6-2-351']
oh, we do. ha, ha.:::['6-2-352']
but not just yet.:::['6-2-353']
really? well, when?:::['6-2-354']
ahem, well, first chandler and monica will get married......and be filthy rich, by the way.:::['6-2-356']
but it won't work out. wow.:::['6-2-357']
then i'm gonna marry chandler for the money.:::['6-2-359']
and you'll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids.:::['6-2-360']
but then we ditch those two and we get married.:::['6-2-362']
we'll have chandler's money and rachel's kids.:::['6-2-363']
getting custody will be easy because of rachel's drinking problem.:::['6-2-364']
ooh, ooh, what about ross?:::['6-2-365']
i don't want to go into the whole thing, but, um......we have words and i kill him.:::['6-2-366']
chandler: okay, this is it.:::['6-1-0']
you sure you wanna do this?:::['6-1-1', '5-24-316']
hello, mrs. ross. woo-hoo!:::['6-1-2']
well, hello, mr. rachel.:::['6-1-3']
whoa! oh, my god.:::['6-1-4']
come on, pheebs, hurry! hurry, hurry, hurry.:::['6-1-5']
phoebe: okay! okay!:::['6-1-6']
oh, my god! is everybody getting married?:::['6-1-7']
joey: agh. no running in the chapel.:::['6-1-8']
hey, don't you give me any of your... hey!:::['6-1-9']
hi. hey!:::['6-1-10']
ross and rachel left a message. they're getting married.:::['6-1-12']
isn't that why you guys are here? yes.:::['6-1-13']
why else would we be here? ha-ha-ha.:::['6-1-14']
well, what happened? did we miss it?:::['6-1-15']
we actually missed it.:::['6-1-16']
maybe you wouldn't have if you could run in the chapel!:::['6-1-17']
this is insane.:::['6-1-18']
what's the big deal? it's not like it's a real marriage.:::['6-1-19']
if you marry in vegas, you're only married in vegas.:::['6-1-21']
what? if you marry here, you're married everywhere.:::['6-1-22']
monica: yeah.:::['6-1-24', '1-10-80', '4-14-276']
oh, well.:::['6-1-26', '4-17-272', '4-21-21', '4-21-27', '3-6-305']
why are we in bed together?:::['6-1-28']
do you have any clothes on?:::['6-1-30']
really? no.:::['6-1-32', '3-3-206']
ugh...:::['6-1-33']
but we didn't have......sex, did we?:::['6-1-34']
i don't remember much about last night.:::['6-1-35']
it was such a blur. ha, ha. oh.:::['6-1-36']
i remember laughing. i laughed a lot. uh-huh?:::['6-1-38']
then we didn't have sex.:::['6-1-39']
oh, i mean, we were really drunk.:::['6-1-40']
i'm glad we didn't do anything stupid.:::['6-1-41']
ross: tell me about it.:::['6-1-42']
morning, pheebs. mm.:::['6-1-43']
well, my movie has been officially canceled.:::['6-1-44']
mm. joey, i'm so sorry.:::['6-1-45']
you want my breakfast?:::['6-1-46']
eh, too depressed to eat.:::['6-1-47']
i'll probably eat in, like, five minutes.:::['6-1-48']
so i guess i'll fly home with you. what time is your flight?:::['6-1-49']
what about my cab? i don't need that anymore.:::['6-1-50']
no, you borrowed my cab. you have to drive it back.:::['6-1-51']
i don't wanna drive back by myself. i get lonely.:::['6-1-52']
oh, ooh. how about if you come with me?:::['6-1-53']
i don't know, it's a long trip. that would be great.:::['6-1-54']
we could talk and play games.:::['6-1-55']
this could be our chance to, like, renew our friendship.:::['6-1-56']
are you asking me to have a "frienaissance"?:::['6-1-57']
sure?:::['6-1-58']
heh. all right, although i don't think we need one. i never stopped loving you.:::['6-1-59']
so has anybody talked to dr. and mrs. geller yet?:::['6-1-62']
mm-hm. they left me a message. they'll be here.:::['6-1-63']
where is the waitress? i'm starving.:::['6-1-64']
it's a buffet, man.:::['6-1-65']
here's where i win all my money back!:::['6-1-66']
i gotta talk to you.:::['6-1-67']
monica and i almost got married.:::['6-1-70']
my god!:::['6-1-71', '7-22-47', '7-5-287', '7-12-242', '5-7-157']
that's huge! ha-ha-ha, hey.:::['6-1-72']
wait a minute. why wasn't i invited?:::['6-1-73']
and who was gonna be your best man? don't say ross. do not say ross.:::['6-1-74']
i just don't think that monica and i are ready yet. i love her......but seeing ross and rachel:::['6-1-75']
come out of that chapel......was like a wake-up call that monica:::['6-1-76']
and i are moving so fast, you know.:::['6-1-77']
how do i tell her without crushing her?:::['6-1-78']
tell her she's not marriage material.:::['6-1-80']
girls say it to me all the time.:::['6-1-82']
and if she's anything like me, she's just gonna be relieved.:::['6-1-83']
how do i tell him that it's too soon?:::['6-1-84']
he's gonna think i don't love him anymore.:::['6-1-85']
well, you don't. yes, i do.:::['6-1-86']
good. i was just testing you.:::['6-1-87']
chandler: hey. oh, hi.:::['6-1-88']
we were just talking about bacon.:::['6-1-89']
no, we were talking about tennis.:::['6-1-90']
tennis is more believable.:::['6-1-91']
all: hey.:::['6-1-92', '2-13-318', '5-21-216', '5-1-249']
monica: hi. rachel: thank you.:::['6-1-93']
coffee. heh. mm.:::['6-1-94']
what? are we gonna talk......about what you guys did last night,or?:::['6-1-95']
what do you mean "last night"? nothing, uh, happened last night.:::['6-1-96']
uh-huh. ross invited us all to watch.:::['6-1-97']
rach, we weren't gonna miss our friends marrying.:::['6-1-98']
huh, who got married?:::['6-1-99']
you did?:::['6-1-100', '1-8-22']
what? heh.:::['6-1-101', '2-7-297']
wh...? hello. we didn't get married. no, we didn't. that's ridi...:::['6-1-102']
wait, wait, wait. i remember being in a chapel.:::['6-1-103']
they would not let us get married when we were that drunk.:::['6-1-104']
they let you get married.:::['6-1-105']
most people who marry in vegas are drunk.:::['6-1-106']
heh, i'm drunk right now.:::['6-1-107']
i can't have a mimosa with breakfast? i'm on vacation.:::['6-1-108']
well, i guess we find a divorce lawyer. uh-huh.:::['6-1-110']
well, i think, i think ross already has one.:::['6-1-111']
now, this one's free, right?:::['6-1-112']
because you paid for the first two, third one free.:::['6-1-113']
laugh it up, but the joke's on you......because we don't need to get divorced.:::['6-1-114']
we're just gonna get an annulment. joey: an annulment?:::['6-1-115']
ross, i don't think surgery is the answer here.:::['6-1-116']
oh, that's your thing!:::['6-1-117']
your thing, that you're the guy who gets divorced.:::['6-1-119']
oh, yeah.:::['6-1-120', '1-2-3', '9-18-313', '9-13-63', '9-13-360', '10-12-377', '10-13-296', '10-9-353', '2-8-291', '2-10-178', '2-9-276', '2-18-242', '2-23-77', '2-21-38', '5-24-129', '5-24-134', '5-20-61', '5-20-262', '5-9-274', '5-5-87', '5-7-191', '5-7-256', '5-14-225', '4-13-286', '4-11-212', '4-20-21', '4-23-145', '3-12-271']
no, no, that's not "my thing.":::['6-1-121']
i do not love getting divorced.:::['6-1-122']
yes, you do. this is your third divorce.:::['6-1-123']
you love divorce so much, you're probably gonna marry it......and then it won't work out, so you're:::['6-1-124']
gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy.:::['6-1-125']
ha-ha-ha.:::['6-1-126', '7-18-291', '5-12-259', '3-18-55', '3-25-33']
i'm so drunk.:::['6-1-127']
so, what should we do? i don't know.:::['6-1-128']
i know i love you.:::['6-1-129']
i know i love you. heh.:::['6-1-130']
where are we on the whole "going back......to where they have the marriages":::['6-1-131']
thing? i love you.:::['6-1-132']
that's a good question.:::['6-1-133']
last night we let the dice decide.:::['6-1-134']
we should leave it up to fate again. i love you!:::['6-1-135']
we don't get married unless there's a sign.:::['6-1-136']
okay? so say, uh...:::['6-1-137']
you roll another eight, then there's a sign that we should get married.:::['6-1-138']
all right. eight we get married......but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10,11, 12, we don't get married.:::['6-1-139']
sounds great. okay.:::['6-1-140']
dealer: hey, we got a shooter.:::['6-1-141']
money, please.:::['6-1-142']
ready? ready.:::['6-1-143']
come on, eight.:::['6-1-144']
yes, yes, eight.:::['6-1-145']
dealer: eight, easy eight.:::['6-1-146']
wow, i can't believe i rolled an eight. that was so unlikely.:::['6-1-147']
well, let's get married. i guess. aah.:::['6-1-148']
that wasn't hard. last night i rolled a hard eight.:::['6-1-149']
it was the wrong kind of eight. no wedding! damn it!:::['6-1-150']
agh! aah! unh, i wanted it so bad!:::['6-1-151']
wanna go pack? yeah.:::['6-1-152']
we're doing the right thing, right? oh, of course we are.:::['6-1-153']
heh, we left it up to fate.:::['6-1-154']
if we were supposed to get married, there would be a sign.:::['6-1-155']
okay, you have 19 questions left. use them wisely.:::['6-1-156']
come on, joey. you can't win if you don't ask any......questions!:::['6-1-157']
aah! aah.:::['6-1-158']
what? you promised me a fun road trip.:::['6-1-159']
we've been on the road for 6 hours, and you've been asleep for 5 and a half.:::['6-1-160']
we are switching, and you are going to drive back.:::['6-1-161']
that will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper.:::['6-1-162']
all right. all right.:::['6-1-163', '9-9-247', '5-19-141']
yeah. and until then, you are going to sing to me.:::['6-1-164']
because the radio's broken, and you are selfish, but you have a nice voice.:::['6-1-165']
really? sing!:::['6-1-166']
i wanna rock 'n' roll all night:::['6-1-167']
joey: man, this is a long drive.:::['6-1-168']
are my eyes open?:::['6-1-169']
morning. aah!:::['6-1-171']
hey. hey, hubby. heh.:::['6-1-172']
yeah. actually, um, i wanted to talk to you......about that whole annulment thing.:::['6-1-173']
uh-huh?:::['6-1-174', '1-18-257']
yeah, i'm not gonna do that.:::['6-1-175']
okay. heh.:::['6-1-176', '9-9-66', '7-5-142', '2-7-191', '4-24-251']
so we'll just stay married.:::['6-1-177']
yes, exactly.:::['6-1-178']
and i will make everyone call me mrs. geller.:::['6-1-179']
wow, this is so amazing.:::['6-1-180']
i, uh, really thought i'd have to talk you into this more.:::['6-1-181']
ha, ha. now i'm scared because i don't actually think you're kidding.:::['6-1-182']
i'm not kidding.:::['6-1-183', '5-18-236', '5-18-258']
look, i... i... heh.:::['6-1-184']
i can't have three failed marriages.:::['6-1-185']
i can't, okay?:::['6-1-186']
i am not gonna be that guy.:::['6-1-187']
so, what, we just stay married forever?:::['6-1-188']
okay, how...?:::['6-1-189']
how is this going to affect you, really?:::['6-1-190']
i mean, you fill some form out once in a while......instead of checking the box "miss,":::['6-1-191']
you check the box that says, "mrs.":::['6-1-192']
it's right next to it.:::['6-1-193']
okay. i'm sorry, you're right. you know what?:::['6-1-194']
we can stay married......because i thought that the boxes:::['6-1-195']
were far away from each other.:::['6-1-196']
all right. look, just......please take a moment here......and think about what:::['6-1-197']
you're asking of me. okay?:::['6-1-198']
i am asking you to do me a favor.:::['6-1-199']
you are asking me to be your wife.:::['6-1-200']
and, as my wife, i think you should grant me this favor.:::['6-1-201']
that kid kicked me really hard.:::['6-1-202']
well, you did pull his hair.:::['6-1-203']
he took my snack. i'm not getting into this again.:::['6-1-204']
all right, you know what? hurts really bad.:::['6-1-205']
well, i told you not to walk. here.:::['6-1-206']
there. there. okay.:::['6-1-207']
this doesn't mean anything, does it? no.:::['6-1-208']
how could you pick up a hitchhiker?:::['6-1-209']
he could be a rape... he could be a rapist or a killer or something.:::['6-1-210']
don't you think i asked him that before he got in?:::['6-1-211']
i'm not talking to you. you go back to sleep.:::['6-1-212']
and, you, are you a rapist? no.:::['6-1-213']
do you like car games?:::['6-1-214']

make you wanna stay married.:::['6-1-221']
we register......and you get to keep all the presents.:::['6-1-223']
no, ross, come on. no, listen.:::['6-1-224']
i've thought about how to tell you this, and, um, the bottom line, ross......is we cannot stay married.:::['6-1-225']
i don't know if that's true... oh, but it is.:::['6-1-226']
ahem. okay. you know what this is?:::['6-1-227']
this is a difference of opinion.:::['6-1-228']
when that happens in a marriage... oh, ross, come on!:::['6-1-229']
this is not a marriage! this is the world's worst hangover!:::['6-1-230']
ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, i will.:::['6-1-231']
all right. all right, i'll do it.:::['6-1-232']
hey, hey, um......uh, is there any such thing:::['6-1-234']
as an annulment shower?:::['6-1-235']
there's the train station, where i get off.:::['6-1-236']
well, i have your address and phone number.:::['6-1-237']
and i have your name and the fact that you're a drifter.:::['6-1-238']

pheebs, look, i am so sorry.:::['6-1-250']
i promised you a fun road trip with your friend......and i didn't deliver, okay?:::['6-1-251']
now i know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship.:::['6-1-252']
so i will strive to stay awake for as long as i know you.:::['6-1-253']
you can still sleep at night and stuff.:::['6-1-254']
so can we play 20 questions now?:::['6-1-256']
i got a good one. i thought about it since kansas.:::['6-1-257']

that is incredible!:::['6-1-262']
you are the master!:::['6-1-263']
aah! bug!:::['6-1-264']

jeez, relax, it's not like we're mar... aah, agh.:::['6-1-276']
you know, i was thinking, what if i, uh......unpack here?:::['6-1-277']
all your stuff would be here.:::['6-1-278']
what if all my stuff was here?:::['6-1-280']
then you'd be going back and forth all the time.:::['6-1-281', '7-21-80']
doesn't make any sense.:::['6-1-282', '7-21-81']
what if we live together, and you understand what i'm saying?:::['6-1-284', '7-21-83']
live together?:::['6-1-285']
there've been no signs for that.:::['6-1-286']

it still doesn't work.:::['6-1-322']
i'm not finished. oh.:::['6-1-323']

monica: tell him. please tell him. - tell him.:::['1-22-0']
shut up. - tell me what?:::['1-22-1']
monica: you won't even look at him. - oh, come on, tell me.:::['1-22-2']
i could use another reason why women won't look at me.:::['1-22-3']
all right, all right, all right.:::['1-22-4', '3-11-17']
last night, i had a dream......that, um, you and i were, uh...:::['1-22-5']
doing it on this table.:::['1-22-6']
wow. - excellent dream score.:::['1-22-7']
why...? why would you dream that?:::['1-22-8']
more importantly, was i any good?:::['1-22-9']
well, you were pretty damned good. ha, ha.:::['1-22-10']
interesting, because in my dreams, i'm surprisingly inadequate.:::['1-22-11']
well, last night, you seemed to know your way around the table.:::['1-22-12']
i love it when we share.:::['1-22-13']
chandler: you okay there?:::['1-22-14']
i can't believe you two had sex in her dream.:::['1-22-15']
i'm sorry. it was a one-time thing.:::['1-22-16']
i was very drunk, and it was someone else's subconscious.:::['1-22-17']
friends s01e22: the one with the ick factor:::['1-22-18']
hello, rachel. - ugh.:::['1-22-19']

ooh. oh, give me. can you see me operating a drill press?:::['1-22-21']
i don't know. what are you wearing?:::['1-22-22']
pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?:::['1-22-23']
just for some short-term work.:::['1-22-24']
you know, till i get back some of my massage clients.:::['1-22-25']
pirates again?:::['1-22-26']
no. nothing like that.:::['1-22-27']
i'm just such a dummy.:::['1-22-28']

it's a whole big boob story.:::['1-22-36']
i could be a secretary.:::['1-22-37']
well, i don't know if it's your kind of thing......because, uh, it involves a lot of being normal......ahem, for a large portion of the day.:::['1-22-38']
what are you playing with? - it's my new beeper.:::['1-22-40']
why the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?:::['1-22-41']
is it, like, for dinosaur emergencies? "help, come quick! they're still extinct!":::['1-22-42']
no, it's for when carol goes into labor. she can get me wherever i am.:::['1-22-43']
all she has to do is dial 55-jimbo.:::['1-22-44']
a cool phone number and a possible name for the kid.:::['1-22-45']
i'll see you guys later. - off to see young ethan?:::['1-22-46']

yeah. ha, ha.:::['1-22-60', '9-7-314', '3-18-69', '3-12-333']

look, he's a great guy, and i love being with him, but, you know......things happen when they happen.:::['1-22-89']
you don't plan these things.:::['1-22-90']
oh. so did you shave your legs? - yeah.:::['1-22-91']
would you let it go, ross? it was just a dream.:::['1-22-93']
it doesn't mean...:::['1-22-94']
oh, oh, oh. oh, this is it. oh, my god. it's baby time. baby time.:::['1-22-95']

me. - ah.:::['1-22-112']
i didn't tell anybody that i knew you. - why not?:::['1-22-113']
well, because, you know.:::['1-22-114']
they don't like you.:::['1-22-115']
what? - i thought you knew that.:::['1-22-116']
nah-uh.:::['1-22-117']
who doesn't like me? - everyone.:::['1-22-118']
except for, um...:::['1-22-119']
no. everyone.:::['1-22-120']
what are you talking about? - don't feel bad.:::['1-22-121']
you know, they used to like you a lot.:::['1-22-122']
but then you got promoted, and now you're all, like, mr. boss-man.:::['1-22-123']
you know, mr. bing. mr. bing. boss-man bing.:::['1-22-124']
i can't believe it. - yeah, yeah. they even do you.:::['1-22-125']

"my scone!":::['1-22-132']
ross, joey & phoebe: "my scone!":::['1-22-133']
okay, i don't sound like that. that is so not true.:::['1-22-134']
that is so not... that is so not... that...:::['1-22-135']
oh, shut up.:::['1-22-136']
ha, ha. you did not.:::['1-22-137']
i am telling you, up until i was 9......i thought gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happened.:::['1-22-138']
ha, ha. how is that possible? - think about it. it's always on the news.:::['1-22-139']
"a man is being held up at gunpoint.":::['1-22-140']
"tourists are being terrorized at gunpoint.":::['1-22-141']
and i just kept thinking, "why do people continue to go there?":::['1-22-142']
oh, ah.:::['1-22-143', '7-2-71']
i should go. - okay.:::['1-22-144']
unless... - what?:::['1-22-146']
uh, unless you wanna stay over.:::['1-22-147']
i mean, i'm going to. so...:::['1-22-148']
yeah, i'd really like that.:::['1-22-149']
uh, before we get into any staying-over stuff......there's something you should know.:::['1-22-150']
okay. is this like "i have an early class tomorrow"......or "i'm secretly married to a goat"?:::['1-22-151']
well, it's somewhere in between.:::['1-22-152']
you see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, i'm not, uh...:::['1-22-153']
well, i mean, i haven't ever, um...:::['1-22-154']
ethan? - yeah?:::['1-22-155']
are you a virgin?:::['1-22-156']
well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days......then yes, i am.:::['1-22-157']
i, uh... i've kind of been waiting for the right person.:::['1-22-158']
really? - yeah.:::['1-22-159', '1-8-303', '1-17-187', '1-5-284', '2-12-203']
you do know i was talking about you, right?:::['1-22-160']
you keep saying that.:::['1-22-162']
you know, you read about it. you see it in the movies.:::['1-22-163']
even when you practice it at home, man, oh, man......it is nothing like that.:::['1-22-164']
listen, listen.:::['1-22-166']
um, you told me something that was really difficult for you.:::['1-22-167']
and, um, well, i figure if you can be honest, then i can too.:::['1-22-168']
oh, god, don't tell me i did it wrong. - no.:::['1-22-169']
no, no, no. - oh.:::['1-22-170']
nothing wrong about that. - oh. ha, ha.:::['1-22-171']
um, okay. here goes.:::['1-22-172']
i'm not 22.:::['1-22-173']
i'm 25.:::['1-22-174']
and 13 months.:::['1-22-175']
but i figure, you know, that shouldn't change anything.:::['1-22-177']
i mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are?:::['1-22-178']
listen, um......as long as we're telling stuff, uh......i have another one for you.:::['1-22-179']
i'm a little younger than i said.:::['1-22-180']
you're not a senior?:::['1-22-181']
oh, i'm a senior.:::['1-22-182']
in high school.:::['1-22-183']

oh, god. i just had sex with someone who wasn't alive during the bicentennial.:::['1-22-186']
i just had sex.:::['1-22-187']
ethan, focus. how could you not tell me?:::['1-22-188']
you never told me how old you were. - that's different.:::['1-22-189']
my lie didn't make one of us a felon in 48 states.:::['1-22-190']
what were you thinking? - i wasn't thinking. i was busy falling...:::['1-22-191']
don't say it. ...in love with you.:::['1-22-192']
well, fall out of it.:::['1-22-195']
you know, you shouldn't even be here. it's a school night.:::['1-22-196']
oh, god. oh, god.:::['1-22-197', '1-2-67']

well, why not? was i doing something particularly saucy?:::['1-22-206']

no. - you sure?:::['1-22-212']
nobody, uh, handing out mints or anything?:::['1-22-213']
no, it was just the three of us.:::['1-22-214']
so tell me, was it like you and chandler and then you and me......or you and me and chandler?:::['1-22-216']
you know what? - what?:::['1-22-217', '1-24-298', '2-17-315']
there were times......when it wasn't even me.:::['1-22-218']

ross: hey, mon. rachel: mon.:::['1-22-220']

all: mon!:::['1-22-223']
what? - ethan called again.:::['1-22-224']
you're not seeing him anymore? - no.:::['1-22-226']
you know, sometimes just things don't work out.:::['1-22-227']
and this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym?:::['1-22-228']
i didn't say any... i did not say anything, i swear.:::['1-22-229']
he stopped by.:::['1-22-230']
joey: next time you talk to him......could you ask him which one the strongest power ranger is?:::['1-22-231']
oh, my life is just so amusing. heh, heh. can we drop it now?:::['1-22-232']
sorry. sorry.:::['1-22-233', '9-8-305', '5-5-102', '4-24-277']
it's morphing time.:::['1-22-234']
stegosaurus! - tyrannosaurus!:::['1-22-235']
ooh. oh, i gotta go.:::['1-22-236']
whoa. ooh, head rush. oh.:::['1-22-237']

cool. ha, ha.:::['1-22-239']
where you going?:::['1-22-240', '2-8-184', '4-17-140']
oh, i got a birthday party with some work people.:::['1-22-241']
work people?:::['1-22-242']
nobody told me. - no, i know.:::['1-22-243']
that's part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you extravaganza.:::['1-22-244']
know what? i don't get this. a month ago, these people were my friends.:::['1-22-245']
just because i'm in charge, doesn't mean i'm a different person.:::['1-22-246']
well, then you should come tonight, just hang out with them.:::['1-22-247']
let them see what a great guy you still are.:::['1-22-248']
you think i should? - i really do, yeah.:::['1-22-249']
okay. okay. phoebe: okay.:::['1-22-250']
oh, but, um, could we not go together?:::['1-22-251']
i don't wanna be the geek who invited the boss, you know?:::['1-22-252']
chandler: i think last night was great.:::['1-22-253']
you know, the karaoke thing? tracy and i doing "ebony and lvory"?:::['1-22-254']
mm-hm. - ha, ha.:::['1-22-255']
you were great. but they still made fun of you.:::['1-22-256']
what? - now you're more like mr. caring-boss.:::['1-22-257']
mr. "i'm-one-of-you"-boss.:::['1-22-258']
mr. "i-wanna-be-your-buddy"- boss-man-bing.:::['1-22-259']
then i don't get it.:::['1-22-260']
well, you know what, chandler? i think you just gotta face it.:::['1-22-261']
you're, like, the guy in the big office, you know?:::['1-22-262']
you're the one that hires them and fires them.:::['1-22-263']
they still say you're a great boss. - they do?:::['1-22-264']
but they're not your friends anymore.:::['1-22-266']
but i just want to... - no, but you can't.:::['1-22-267']
but i just want... - ah-ah.:::['1-22-268']
aren't you gonna...?:::['1-22-269']
oh, carol and i have a new system.:::['1-22-270']
if she punches in "911," it means she's having a baby.:::['1-22-271']
otherwise, i just ignore it. - what about andre?:::['1-22-272']
this morning he got a call from what i think was our cousin nathan.:::['1-22-273']
and frankly, it was a little more than i needed to know.:::['1-22-274']
that was gonna be my opener.:::['1-22-276']
hey, did you guys check out those new hand dryers in the bathroom?:::['1-22-277']
i thought that was just a rumor. rachel: true story.:::['1-22-278']
all right, look, i gotta tell you something.:::['1-22-279']
i'm not 17.:::['1-22-280']
i only said that so you'd think i was cute and vulnerable.:::['1-22-281']
i'm actually 30.:::['1-22-282']
i have a wife. i have a job. i'm your congressman.:::['1-22-283']
monica, this is ridiculous. we are great together.:::['1-22-284']
we can talk, we make each other laugh. and the sex. oh, man.:::['1-22-285']
okay, i have no frame of reference, but i thought that was great.:::['1-22-286']
it was. - then what's the problem?:::['1-22-287']
ethan, it's, um...:::['1-22-288']
it's icky.:::['1-22-289']
icky?:::['1-22-290']
you're actually gonna throw this away because it's icky?:::['1-22-291']
look, this isn't easy for me either.:::['1-22-292']
i wish things were different.:::['1-22-293']
if you were a few years older or i was a few years younger......or we lived in biblical times......i could really... - no, don't say it.:::['1-22-294']
love you.:::['1-22-295', '8-14-62']
are your hands still wet? - they're moist.:::['1-22-296']
yeah, right? ahem. - let's dry them again.:::['1-22-297']
or, like, "could these margaritas be any stronger?":::['1-22-298']
hey, chandler. - hello, mr. bing.:::['1-22-299']
loved your stevie wonder last night.:::['1-22-300']

terry, i know i haven't worked here very long......but i was wondering, do you think it would be possible......if i got a $100 advance on my salary?:::['1-9-0']
an advance?:::['1-9-1']
it's so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family.:::['1-9-2']
see, every year, we go skiing in vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket......but i've sort of started this whole independent thing, you know......which is actually why i took this "job.":::['1-9-3']
rachel, rachel, sweetheart.:::['1-9-4']
you're a terrible, terrible waitress.:::['1-9-5']
really, really awful.:::['1-9-6']
okay, i hear what you're saying. i'm with you.:::['1-9-7']
but i'm trying really hard, and i think i'm doing better.:::['1-9-9']
i really do.:::['1-9-10', '10-15-305']
does anybody need coffee?:::['1-9-11']
man: yeah, over here. woman: yeah, i do.:::['1-9-12']

rachel: okay, okay. that's fine, fine.:::['1-9-18']

yes, i am.:::['1-9-31', '7-2-115', '7-2-189', '2-3-216', '3-12-174']
as of today, i am officially joey tribbiani, actor/model.:::['1-9-32']
that's funny, i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani, man/woman.:::['1-9-34']
what were you modeling for?:::['1-9-35']
you know those posters for the city free clinic?:::['1-9-36']
oh, wow. you're gonna be one of those healthy, healthy, healthy guys?:::['1-9-37']
ah? - the asthma guy's really cute.:::['1-9-38']
oh, he is. rachel: isn't he?:::['1-9-39']
you know which one you're gonna be? - no, no.:::['1-9-40']
but i hear lyme disease is open, so, you know...:::['1-9-41']
good luck, man. i hope you get it.:::['1-9-42']
well, you were right. how can they do this to us, huh?:::['1-9-44']
it's thanksgiving.:::['1-9-45']
aw. tell you what. how about if i cook dinner at my place?:::['1-9-46']
i'll make it just like mom's.:::['1-9-47']
will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?:::['1-9-48']
you know they're not actually supposed to...?:::['1-9-49']
i'll work on the lumps.:::['1-9-50']
joey, you're going home, right? - yeah.:::['1-9-51']
and i assume, chandler, you're still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays?:::['1-9-52']
yes, every single one of them.:::['1-9-53']
phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?:::['1-9-54']
yeah, and her boyfriend.:::['1-9-55']

so you're free thursday, then?:::['1-9-57']
yeah. oh, can i come? - yeah.:::['1-9-58']
rach, you still thinking you're gonna make it to vail?:::['1-9-59']
absolutely. shoop, shoop, shoop.:::['1-9-60']
only $102 to go. - i thought it was 98.50.:::['1-9-61']
yeah, well, it was, but i broke a cup.:::['1-9-62']
well, i'm off to carol's.:::['1-9-63']
ooh, ooh, why don't we invite her?:::['1-9-64']
ooh, ooh, because she's my ex-wife......and will probably wanna bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.:::['1-9-65']
hi. is carol here?:::['1-9-66']
no, she's at a faculty meeting. - oh.:::['1-9-67']
well, i just came by to pick up my skull.:::['1-9-68']
well, not mine, but...:::['1-9-69']
come in. - thanks.:::['1-9-70']
yeah, carol borrowed it for a class, and i have to get it back to the museum.:::['1-9-71']
what's it look like?:::['1-9-72']
kind of like a big face without skin.:::['1-9-73']
yes, heh, i'm familiar with the concept.:::['1-9-74']
we can just look for it. - okay.:::['1-9-75']
wow, you guys, heh, sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.:::['1-9-76']
well, you know, you have to take a course.:::['1-9-77']
otherwise they don't let you do it.:::['1-9-78']
hey, hey, yertle the turtle. a classic.:::['1-9-79']
actually, i'm reading it to the baby.:::['1-9-80']
the baby that hasn't been born yet?:::['1-9-81']
uh, wouldn't that mean you're......crazy?:::['1-9-82']
what, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?:::['1-9-83']
you're not serious. i mean, you really talk to it?:::['1-9-84']
yeah, all the time. i want the baby to know my voice.:::['1-9-85']
do you, uh...? do you talk about me?:::['1-9-86']
yeah, yeah. all the time. - really?:::['1-9-87']
but, um, we just refer to you as "bobo the sperm guy.":::['1-9-88']
look, if she's talking to it, i just think i should get some belly time too.:::['1-9-89']
i mean, not that i believe any of this.:::['1-9-90']
oh, i believe it. i think the baby can totally hear everything.:::['1-9-91']
really? - i can show you.:::['1-9-92']
this will seem a little weird.:::['1-9-93']
but you put your head inside this turkey......and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.:::['1-9-94']
i'd just like to say i'm totally behind this experiment.:::['1-9-95']
in fact, i'd very much like to butter your head.:::['1-9-96']
ross: hey. monica: hey, rach.:::['1-9-97']
did you make your money? rachel: no, not even close.:::['1-9-98']
forget vail. forget seeing my family.:::['1-9-99']
forget shoop, shoop, shoop.:::['1-9-100']
uh, rach......here's your mail.:::['1-9-101']
thanks. you can just put it on the table.:::['1-9-102', '1-9-105']
heh. no.:::['1-9-103', '1-20-274']
here's your mail.:::['1-9-104']

oh, you guys are great. - aw. ha, ha.:::['1-9-108']
rachel: aw. - we all chipped in.:::['1-9-109']
we did? - you owe me 20 bucks.:::['1-9-110']
thank you. thank you so much.:::['1-9-111']
chandler, here you go. got your traditional holiday feast.:::['1-9-112']
got your tomato soup......your grilled-cheese fixings, and your family-size bag of funyuns.:::['1-9-113']
wait, this is what you're having for thanksgiving dinner?:::['1-9-114']
what is it with you and this holiday?:::['1-9-115']
all right, i'm 9 years old.:::['1-9-116']
aw. - aw, i hate this story.:::['1-9-117']
we've just finished thanksgiving dinner.:::['1-9-118']
i have... and i remember this part vividly. - a mouthful of pumpkin pie.:::['1-9-119']
and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.:::['1-9-120']
it's very difficult to enjoy thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.:::['1-9-122']
we used to work together. - we did?:::['1-9-124']
yeah, at macy's. you're the obsession girl, right?:::['1-9-125']
yes. - i was the aramis guy.:::['1-9-126']
aramis? aramis? aramis? - oh.:::['1-9-127']
yeah, right.:::['1-9-128', '1-3-303', '1-2-1', '1-13-319', '8-2-10', '2-16-359', '5-18-337', '4-4-153', '3-25-34']
i gotta tell you, you're the best in the business.:::['1-9-129']
get out. joey: i'm serious.:::['1-9-130']
you're amazing. you know when to spritz. you know when to lay back.:::['1-9-131']
really? you don't know what that means to me.:::['1-9-132']
mm, mm.:::['1-9-133', '8-14-206']
you smell great tonight. uh, what are you wearing?:::['1-9-134']
listen, do you wanna go get a drink or something?:::['1-9-136']
yeah, that would be...:::['1-9-137']
what's wrong? - i just remembered i have to do something.:::['1-9-138']
oh. what?:::['1-9-139']
joey: whoa. wait, wait, wait.:::['1-9-142']
so i guess you all saw it.:::['1-9-143']
what? - saw what?:::['1-9-144']
no, we're just laughing. you know how laughter can be infectious.:::['1-9-145']
set another place for thanksgiving. my entire family thinks i have vd.:::['1-9-147']
tonight, on a very special blossom.:::['1-9-148']
monica: mm, looking good. okay.:::['1-9-149']
cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.:::['1-9-150']
it's just not the same without mom in the kitchen.:::['1-9-153']
ugh. all right, that's it. get out of my way and stop annoying me.:::['1-9-154']
well, that's closer. that's...:::['1-9-155']
i got the ticket, i got the ticket.:::['1-9-156']
five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.:::['1-9-157']
oh, you must stop shooping.:::['1-9-158']
okay, i'm gonna get my stuff.:::['1-9-159']
chandler, will you just come in, already?:::['1-9-160']
no, thank you. i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.:::['1-9-161']
look out. incoming pumpkin pie.:::['1-9-162']
okay, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.:::['1-9-163']
hey, monica, i got a question. i don't see any tater tots.:::['1-9-164']
that's not a question.:::['1-9-165']
but my mom always makes them. it's like a tradition.:::['1-9-166']
you get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot.:::['1-9-167']
i mean, it's bad enough i can't be with my family......because of my disease.:::['1-9-168']
tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps......and in the form of tots.:::['1-9-170']
all right, i'm off to talk to my unborn child.:::['1-9-172']
ah. - okay, mom never hit.:::['1-9-173']
phoebe: okay, all done.:::['1-9-174']
what? phoebe, did you whip the pota...?:::['1-9-175']
ross needs lumps.:::['1-9-176']
oh, i'm sorry. oh, i just...:::['1-9-177']
i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.:::['1-9-178']
why would we do that?:::['1-9-179']
then they'd be just like my mom used to make it......you know, before she died.:::['1-9-180']
okay, three kinds of potatoes coming up.:::['1-9-181']
okay. goodbye, you guys.:::['1-9-182']
thanks for everything.:::['1-9-183']
oh, god, look at... sorry. i'm so sorry.:::['1-9-184']
the most unbelievable thing has happened. underdog has gotten away.:::['1-9-185']
the balloon? - no, no, the actual cartoon character.:::['1-9-186']
of course the balloon.:::['1-9-187']
it's all over the news. before he reached macy's......he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park.:::['1-9-188']
i'm going to the roof. who's with me? - well, i can't. i gotta go.:::['1-9-189']
an 80-foot inflatable dog loose over the city?:::['1-9-190']
how often does that happen? - almost never.:::['1-9-191']

okay, here we go.:::['1-9-195', '1-7-3', '8-4-198', '10-4-332', '10-16-224', '2-17-42', '3-1-337']
okay, where am i talking to here? i mean, uh...:::['1-9-197']
well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...:::['1-9-198']
just aim for the bump.:::['1-9-199']
okay, here goes.:::['1-9-202', '5-19-255', '5-5-92']
you know, i... you know, i can't do this.:::['1-9-203']
this is... it's too weird. i feel stupid.:::['1-9-204']
all right, so don't do it. it's fine.:::['1-9-205']
you don't have to do it just because susan does it.:::['1-9-206']
hello, baby. hello, hello.:::['1-9-207']
that moment when we first saw the giant dog shadow fall over the park?:::['1-9-208']
but did they have to shoot him down? i mean, that was just mean.:::['1-9-209']
okay, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside......and juicy on the inside.:::['1-9-210']
why are we standing here?:::['1-9-211']
we're waiting for you to open the door. you've got the keys.:::['1-9-212']
no, i don't.:::['1-9-213', '9-1-217', '2-18-317', '4-5-96']
yes, you do. when we left, you said, "got the keys.":::['1-9-214']
no, i didn't. i asked, "got the keys?":::['1-9-215']
no, no, no. you said, "got the keys.":::['1-9-216']
either of you have the keys?:::['1-9-217']
the oven is on. - oh, i've gotta get my ticket.:::['1-9-218']
wait. we have a copy of your key. - well, then get it, get it!:::['1-9-219']
hey, hey. that tone won't make me go any faster.:::['1-9-220']
joey. - that one will.:::['1-9-221']
ross: and everyone's telling me::::['1-9-222']
"you gotta pick a major. you gotta pick a major.":::['1-9-223']
so on a dare, i picked paleontology.:::['1-9-224']
and you have no idea what i'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus.:::['1-9-225']
you're just happy you don't have gills anymore.:::['1-9-226']
look, you don't have to talk to it. you can sing to it.:::['1-9-227']
oh, please. i am not singing to your stomach, okay?:::['1-9-228']
how's it going? ross: shh, shh, shh.:::['1-9-229']
here we come:::['1-9-230', '1-9-273']
walkin' down the street:::['1-9-231']
get the funniest looks from everyone we meet:::['1-9-232']
hey, hey...:::['1-9-233']
hey, uh, did you just feel that? - i did.:::['1-9-234']
well, does it always, uh...? - no, no, that was the first.:::['1-9-235']
keep singing. keep singing. ross: oh.:::['1-9-236']
hey, hey, you're my baby:::['1-9-237']
and i can't wait to meet you:::['1-9-238']
when you come out i'll buy you a bagel and then we'll go to the zoo:::['1-9-239']
i felt it that time.:::['1-9-240']
hey, hey, i'm your daddy:::['1-9-241']
i'm the one without any breasts:::['1-9-242']
nope, not that one. - can you go any faster with that?:::['1-9-243']
hey, i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys.:::['1-9-244']
you do the math.:::['1-9-245']
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?:::['1-9-246']
for an emergency just like this.:::['1-9-247']
all right, listen, smirky.:::['1-9-248']
if it wasn't for your stupid balloon......i would be on a plane, watching a woman do this right now.:::['1-9-249']
but i'm not.:::['1-9-250', '1-5-210', '9-21-163']
i swear you said you had the keys.:::['1-9-251']
no. i wouldn't say i had the keys unless i had the keys.:::['1-9-252']
and i obviously did not have the keys.:::['1-9-253']
okay, all right, that's it. enough with the keys. no one say "keys.":::['1-9-254']
why would i have the keys?:::['1-9-255']
aside from the fact that you said you did?:::['1-9-256']
but i didn't. - well, you should have.:::['1-9-257']
monica: why? rachel: because.:::['1-9-258']
why? because everything is my responsibility?:::['1-9-259']
isn't it enough that i'm making thanksgiving dinner?:::['1-9-260']
everyone wants a different kind of potato, so i'm making different kinds of potatoes.:::['1-9-261']
you know, does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want?:::['1-9-262']
you know, just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions......and mario gets his tots.:::['1-9-264']
it's my first thanksgiving, and i...:::['1-9-265']
it's all burnt, and i can't...:::['1-9-266']
okay, monica, only dogs can hear you now, so...:::['1-9-267']
look, the door's open. here we go.:::['1-9-268']
ooh. - oh.:::['1-9-270']
well, the turkey's burnt.:::['1-9-271']
potatoes are ruined. potatoes are ruined. potatoes are ruined.:::['1-9-272']
walkin' down the...:::['1-9-274']
this doesn't smell like mom's.:::['1-9-275']
no, it doesn't, does it? but you wanted lumps, ross?:::['1-9-276']
well, here you go, buddy. you got one.:::['1-9-277']
oh, god, this is great.:::['1-9-278']
the plane is gone, so i guess i'm stuck here with you guys.:::['1-9-279']
hey, we all had better plans, okay? this was nobody's first choice.:::['1-9-280']
so why was i busting my ass......to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner?!:::['1-9-282']
you call that delicious? - you be quiet!:::['1-9-283']
all right, stop it, stop it, stop it!:::['1-9-284']
now, this feels like thanksgiving.:::['1-9-285']
phoebe: ew. - what?:::['1-9-286']
phoebe: ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven.:::['1-9-287']
joey, ross & monica: eh.:::['1-9-288']
phoebe: oh, my god. he's not alone.:::['1-9-289']
ugly naked guy......is having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal.:::['1-9-290']
joey: i gotta see this.:::['1-9-291']
all right, ugly naked guy.:::['1-9-293']
ooh, ugly naked dancing.:::['1-9-294']
it's nice that he has someone.:::['1-9-295']
shall i carve?:::['1-9-296']
by all means.:::['1-9-297']
chandler: all right.:::['1-9-298']
okay, who wants light cheese and who wants dark cheese?:::['1-9-299']
i don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.:::['1-9-300']
does anybody wanna split this with me? - ooh, i will.:::['1-9-301']
mm. you guys have to make a wish.:::['1-9-302']
make a wish? - come on, you know, thanksgiving.:::['1-9-303']
ooh. you got the bigger half. what did you wish for?:::['1-9-304']
the bigger half.:::['1-9-305']
all right, i'd like to propose a toast.:::['1-9-306']
a little toast here. ding, ding, ding. all: mm.:::['1-9-307', '10-10-305']
this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving you planned......but for me this has been really great, you know?:::['1-9-308']
i think because it didn't involve divorce......or projectile vomiting.:::['1-9-309', '10-10-307']
i was just thinking, if you'd gone to vail......or if you guys had been with your family, or if you didn't have......syphilis and stuff......we wouldn't be all together, you know?:::['1-9-310']
so i guess what i'm trying to say......is that i'm very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked.:::['1-9-311']
rachel & joey: that's so sweet.:::['1-9-312', '10-10-311']
rachel: thank you.:::['1-9-313', '10-10-312', '3-13-44']
and hey, here's to a lousy christmas.:::['1-9-315', '10-10-314']
and a crappy new year.:::['1-9-316', '10-10-315']
all: hear, hear.:::['1-9-317', '10-10-316']
hey, gorgeous. how's it going?:::['1-8-0']
dehydrated japanese noodles under fluorescent lights.:::['1-8-1']
does it get better than this?:::['1-8-2']
question: you're not dating, are you?:::['1-8-3']
i met somebody who would be perfect for you.:::['1-8-4']
you see, perfect might be a problem.:::['1-8-5']
had you said co-dependent or self-destructive...:::['1-8-6']
you want a date saturday? - yes, please.:::['1-8-7']
okay:::['1-8-8', '4-5-304']
he is cute.:::['1-8-9']
he's funny. he's... - he's a he?:::['1-8-10']
well, yeah.:::['1-8-11', '1-8-151', '5-14-134', '3-2-313']
oh, god. i just...:::['1-8-12']
you're nice... oh, god.:::['1-8-13']
good, shelly. okay. i'm gonna go flush myself down the toilet now.:::['1-8-14']
okay. bye-bye.:::['1-8-15', '3-12-80']
friends s01e08: the one where nana dies twice:::['1-8-16']
chandler: it's hard to enjoy noodles after that. is that ridiculous?:::['1-8-17']
can you believe she actually thought that?:::['1-8-18']
well, when i first met you, i thought maybe......possibly......you might be.:::['1-8-21']
then you spent phoebe's birthday party talking to my breasts......so then i figured maybe not.:::['1-8-23']
huh. did, uh, any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?:::['1-8-24']
i did. - i think so.:::['1-8-25']
not me. - no, no, me neither.:::['1-8-26']
although, uh, back in college, susan saladore did.:::['1-8-27']
you're kidding.:::['1-8-28']
did you tell her i wasn't? - no.:::['1-8-29']
it's because i wanted to go out with her too.:::['1-8-30']
so i told her, actually, you were seeing bernie spellman......who also liked her.:::['1-8-31']
well, this is fascinating.:::['1-8-32']
so, uh, what is it about me?:::['1-8-33']
i don't know. because you're smart, you're funny...:::['1-8-34']
ross is smart and funny. you ever think that about him?:::['1-8-35']
ha, ha. yeah, right. - what is it?:::['1-8-36']
okay, i don't know. you just... you have a quality.:::['1-8-37']
yes, exactly. - right?:::['1-8-38']
yeah, a quality.:::['1-8-39']
"a quality." good. i was worried you were gonna be vague about this.:::['1-8-40']
oh. rachel. it's paolo calling from rome.:::['1-8-43']
oh, my god. calling from rome.:::['1-8-44']
so he's calling from rome. i could do that.:::['1-8-45']
just gotta go to rome.:::['1-8-46']
monica, your dad just beeped in. can you make it quick?:::['1-8-47']
i'm talking to rome.:::['1-8-48']
talking to rome...:::['1-8-49']
hey, dad. what's up?:::['1-8-50']
ross, it's nana.:::['1-8-52']
monica: how you doing? ross: hey, dad.:::['1-8-54']
so, uh, how's she doing?:::['1-8-55']
the doctor says it's a matter of hours.:::['1-8-56']
how are you, mom? - me? i'm fine, fine.:::['1-8-57']
i'm glad you're here.:::['1-8-58']
what's with your hair?:::['1-8-59']
what's different?:::['1-8-61']
oh, maybe that's it.:::['1-8-63']
she's unbelievable. her mother's...:::['1-8-64']
okay, relax, relax.:::['1-8-65']
we are gonna be here a while, it looks like.:::['1-8-66']
we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.:::['1-8-67']
the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.:::['1-8-69']
yeah, they were gross.:::['1-8-71']
oh, you know what i love?:::['1-8-72']
her sweet 'n lows.:::['1-8-73']
how she was always stealing them from restaurants.:::['1-8-74']
not just restaurants, from our house.:::['1-8-75']
mrs. geller?:::['1-8-76']
ross: she looks so small.:::['1-8-77']
well, at least she's with pop-pop and aunt phyllis now.:::['1-8-79']
goodbye, nana.:::['1-8-80']
bye, nana.:::['1-8-81']
ross!:::['1-8-82', '2-19-174', '5-3-74', '3-4-366']
nurse.:::['1-8-83']
what is going on?:::['1-8-84', '7-9-285']
you know, uh, how the nurse said nana had passed?:::['1-8-85']
well, she's not quite.:::['1-8-86']
what? - she's not passed.:::['1-8-87']
she's present. she's back.:::['1-8-88']
she may have died.:::['1-8-90']
"she may have died"?:::['1-8-91']
we're looking into it.:::['1-8-92']
uh, i'll go see.:::['1-8-93']
this almost never happens.:::['1-8-94']
now she's passed.:::['1-8-95']
i just have to know, okay?:::['1-8-96']
is it my hair?:::['1-8-97']
yes, chandler, that's exactly what it is. it's your hair.:::['1-8-98']
yeah, you have homosexual hair.:::['1-8-99']
rachel: hey. monica: hi.:::['1-8-100']
rachel: so did she?:::['1-8-101']
twice.:::['1-8-102', '2-4-314', '4-1-95']
oh, that sucks.:::['1-8-103']
you guys okay?:::['1-8-104']
i don't know. it's weird.:::['1-8-105']
i know she's gone, but i just don't feel, uh...:::['1-8-106']
maybe that's because she's not really gone.:::['1-8-107']
no, no, she's gone.:::['1-8-108']
we checked.:::['1-8-109']
a lot.:::['1-8-110', '10-11-156']
no, i mean, maybe no one ever really goes.:::['1-8-111']
ever since my mom died, every now and then......i get this feeling that she's, like, right here, you know?:::['1-8-112']
oh. and debbie, my best friend from junior high......got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course.:::['1-8-113']
i always get this strong debbie vibe......whenever i use one of those little yellow pencils.:::['1-8-114']
i miss her.:::['1-8-115']
aw. here, pheebs.:::['1-8-116']
want this?:::['1-8-117']
oh, thanks. - sure.:::['1-8-118']
i just sharpened her this morning.:::['1-8-119']
see, i don't believe any of that. i think when you're dead......you're dead. you're gone. you're worm food.:::['1-8-120']
so chandler looks gay, huh?:::['1-8-121']
i don't know who this is, but it's not debbie.:::['1-8-122']
i thought it'd be a closed casket.:::['1-8-123']
well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice.:::['1-8-124']
sweetie, you think you can get in there?:::['1-8-125']
i don't see why not.:::['1-8-126']
ross: here's my retainer.:::['1-8-127']
i was just thinking......when my time comes... - dad.:::['1-8-128']
listen to me.:::['1-8-129']
when my time comes, i wanna be buried at sea.:::['1-8-130']
you what?:::['1-8-131', '9-7-77']
i wanna be buried at sea. it looks like fun.:::['1-8-132']
define "fun.":::['1-8-133']
come on. you'll make a day of it. you'll get a boat, pack a lunch...:::['1-8-134']
and then we throw your body in the water. gee, that does sound fun.:::['1-8-135']
everyone thinks they know me.:::['1-8-136']
everyone says, "jack geller, so predictable.":::['1-8-137']
maybe after i'm gone, they'll say, "buried at sea? huh.":::['1-8-138']
that's probably what they'll say.:::['1-8-139']
i'd like that.:::['1-8-140', '1-5-310']
hey, gorgeous. - hey.:::['1-8-141']
look, i'm sorry about yesterday.:::['1-8-142']
don't worry about it. apparently, other people have made the same mistake.:::['1-8-143']
oh. okay. phew.:::['1-8-144']
so, uh, what do you think it is about me?:::['1-8-145']
i don't know what.:::['1-8-146']
you just have......a quality. - a quality. right. great.:::['1-8-147']
it's a shame, because you and lowell would've made a great couple.:::['1-8-148']
lowell? financial services lowell? that's who you saw me with?:::['1-8-149']
what? he's cute.:::['1-8-150']
he's no brian in payroll.:::['1-8-152']
is brian?:::['1-8-153']
no. i don't know. the point is, if you were gonna set me up......i'd like to think it'd be with somebody like him.:::['1-8-154']
well, i think brian's a little out of your league.:::['1-8-155']
excuse me. you don't think i could get a brian?:::['1-8-156']
because i could get a brian. believe you me.:::['1-8-157']
i'm really not.:::['1-8-158']
ross: this one?:::['1-8-159']
i've shown you every dress we have.:::['1-8-161']
unless you want her to spend eternity in a lemon-yellow pantsuit......go with the burgundy.:::['1-8-162']
whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one.:::['1-8-163']
you're right. we'll go with the burgundy.:::['1-8-164']
a fine choice. i'm coming out.:::['1-8-165']
wait. we need shoes.:::['1-8-166']
okay. uh...:::['1-8-167', '7-8-300']
how about these?:::['1-8-168']
that's really a day shoe.:::['1-8-169']
and where she's going, everyone else will be dressier?:::['1-8-170']
could we see something in a slimmer heel?:::['1-8-171']
okay. i have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy.:::['1-8-172']
i can show you something in a silver that may work.:::['1-8-173']
no, it really should be burgundy.:::['1-8-174']
unless we go with a different dress. - yes.:::['1-8-175']
no, no, no. watch this.:::['1-8-176']
wait, i may have something in the back.:::['1-8-177']
is everything all right, dear?:::['1-8-179']
just nana's stuff.:::['1-8-181']
how we doing? you guys ready?:::['1-8-182']
mom called to remind me not to wear my hair up.:::['1-8-183']
did you know my ears were not my best feature?:::['1-8-184']
some days it's all i can think about.:::['1-8-185']
hi. i'm sorry i'm late. i couldn't find my bearings.:::['1-8-186']
heh. you mean your earrings?:::['1-8-187']
what did i say?:::['1-8-188']
are these the shoes? - yes. paolo sent them from italy.:::['1-8-189']
what? we, uh, don't have shoes here?:::['1-8-190']
morning. we ready to go?:::['1-8-191']
don't we look nice all dressed up?:::['1-8-192']
it's stuff like that, isn't it?:::['1-8-193']
it was a beautiful service. - it really was.:::['1-8-194']
come here, sweetheart.:::['1-8-195']
you know......i think it's time for you to start using night cream.:::['1-8-196']
nothing. just your overcoat sounds remarkably like brent musburger.:::['1-8-198']
check it out. giants-cowboys.:::['1-8-199']
you're watching football at a funeral?:::['1-8-200']
no, it's the pregame. i'm gonna watch it at the reception.:::['1-8-201']
you're a frightening, frightening man.:::['1-8-202']
rachel: oh, no. my new paolo shoes.:::['1-8-203']
oh. i hope they're not ruined.:::['1-8-204']
phoebe: god, what a great day.:::['1-8-205']
what? weatherwise.:::['1-8-206']
the air, the trees.:::['1-8-208']
even though nana's gone, there's something almost, uh, life...:::['1-8-209']
ross, are you okay? - ross!:::['1-8-210']
i'm fine. no, i'm fine.:::['1-8-211']
just......having my worst fear realized, but...:::['1-8-212']
phoebe: i'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm.:::['1-8-213']
huh. - what? what is it?:::['1-8-214']
you missed a belt loop. - ugh.:::['1-8-215']
okay, it's in spasm.:::['1-8-216']
here, sweetie. here.:::['1-8-217']
i took these when i had my golfing accident.:::['1-8-218']
thanks, mom.:::['1-8-219']
andrea: sorry.:::['1-8-220']
hi, i'm andrea.:::['1-8-221']
i'm dorothy's daughter.:::['1-8-222']
hi, i'm chandler, and i have no idea who dorothy is.:::['1-8-223']
phoebe: hey, look who's up.:::['1-8-224']
hey. - how do you feel?:::['1-8-225']
i feel great.:::['1-8-226', '7-9-279']
i feel great. i feel great.:::['1-8-227']
wow, those pills really worked, huh?:::['1-8-228']
yeah. not the first two, but the second two, whew.:::['1-8-229']
i love you guys.:::['1-8-230']
you guys are the greatest. i love my sister.:::['1-8-231']
i love pheebs. ha.:::['1-8-232']
that's so nice. - hey.:::['1-8-233']
chandler.  - hey.:::['1-8-234']
i love you, man.:::['1-8-235']
and listen, if you wanna be gay, be gay.:::['1-8-236']
it doesn't matter to me.:::['1-8-237']
you were right.:::['1-8-238']
rachel. rachel, rachel.:::['1-8-239']
i love you the most.:::['1-8-240']
well, you know who i love the most?:::['1-8-241']
no. - you.:::['1-8-242']
oh, you don't get it.:::['1-8-243']
aw! - what do you got there?:::['1-8-244']
uh, just a, uh, hearing disability.:::['1-8-245']
what's the score?:::['1-8-246']
17-14, giants. three minutes to go in the third.:::['1-8-247']
beautiful.:::['1-8-248']
pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?:::['1-8-249']
your grandmother would've hated this.:::['1-8-250']
well, sure. what with it being her funeral and all.:::['1-8-251']
no, i'd be hearing about......why didn't i get the honey-glazed ham?:::['1-8-252']
or i didn't spend enough on flowers. if i spent more, she'd say::::['1-8-253']
"why waste your money? i don't need flowers, i'm dead.":::['1-8-254']
that sounds like nana.:::['1-8-255']
do you know what it's like to grow up......with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?:::['1-8-256']
i can imagine.:::['1-8-257']
i tell you, it's a wonder your mother turned out......to be the positive, life-affirming person she is.:::['1-8-258']
that is a wonder.:::['1-8-259']
so tell me something, mom. if you had to do it all over again......i mean, if she was here right now......would you tell her?:::['1-8-260']
tell her what?:::['1-8-261']
how she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail.:::['1-8-262']
like your hair, for example.:::['1-8-263']
i'm not sure i know what you're getting at.:::['1-8-264']
would things have been better if you'd just told her the truth?:::['1-8-265']
i think some things are better left unsaid.:::['1-8-267']
i think it's nicer when people just get along.:::['1-8-268']
more wine, dear?:::['1-8-270']
oh, i think so.:::['1-8-271']
those earrings look really lovely on you.:::['1-8-272']
they're yours.:::['1-8-274']
actually, they were nana's.:::['1-8-275']
men: no!:::['1-8-276']
now i'm depressed.:::['1-8-277']
even more than i was.:::['1-8-278']
hey, who's this little naked guy?:::['1-8-279']
uh, that little naked guy would be me.:::['1-8-280']
aw. look at the little thing.:::['1-8-281']
yes, fine. that is my penis.:::['1-8-282']
can we be grownups now?:::['1-8-283']
who are those people? - got me.:::['1-8-284']
that's nana right there in the middle. - wow.:::['1-8-285']
yeah, let's see.:::['1-8-286']
"me and the gang at java joe's.":::['1-8-287', '7-21-245']
wow. monica, you look just like your grandmother.:::['1-8-288']
how old was she there?:::['1-8-289']
let's see. "1939.":::['1-8-290']
uh, twenty-four, twenty-five.:::['1-8-291']
huh. it looks like a fun gang.:::['1-8-292']
ooh, look, look, look. i got monica naked.:::['1-8-293']
let me see.:::['1-8-294', '9-13-151', '7-4-129', '7-4-136', '10-8-178', '5-4-250', '3-23-354', '3-3-233']
no, no. that would be me again.:::['1-8-295']
i'm, uh, just trying something.:::['1-8-296']

he's in a whole other place. yeah. no, he's gone.:::['1-23-196']
no, no, you don't have to fly back. really.:::['1-23-197']
what do you mean, this might be your only chance?:::['1-23-198']
oh. would you stop? i'm only 26.:::['1-23-199']
i'm not even thinking about babies yet.:::['1-23-200']
where have you been? joey: oh, i just had a baby.:::['1-23-201']
mazel tov.:::['1-23-202', '8-13-252', '7-24-158']
i don't know. it could be an hour, it could be three.:::['1-23-203']
but relax, she's doing great.:::['1-23-204']
so, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?:::['1-23-205']
no. no, not at... at the moment, no, i'm not, no.:::['1-23-206']
are you? - no, no.:::['1-23-207']
it's hard enough to get women to go out with me.:::['1-23-208']
heh. right, yeah, i've heard that about cute doctors.:::['1-23-209']
no, no, really.:::['1-23-210']
i suppose it's because i spend so much time, you know......where i do.:::['1-23-211']
oh. - mm.:::['1-23-212']
i try not to let work affect my personal life, but it's hard when you do......what i do. it's like, uh...:::['1-23-213']
well, for instance, what do you do?:::['1-23-214']
i'm a waitress. - okay, all right.:::['1-23-215']
well, aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day......and you're just like, "if i see one more cup of coffee...":::['1-23-216']
ahem. yeah. gotcha.:::['1-23-217']
i'm gonna check up on your friend. - okay, that's fine.:::['1-23-218']
so how did you know i was even here? roy: your mom called me.:::['1-23-219']
so is this her?:::['1-23-220']
no, this is a loaner.:::['1-23-221']
listen, i'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.:::['1-23-222']
oh. i wasn't by myself. i had a doctor, a nurse and a helper guy.:::['1-23-223']
so did you see who won the game?:::['1-23-224']
yeah, knicks by 10. they suck.:::['1-23-225']
eh, they're not so bad.:::['1-23-226']
ross: come on. come on.:::['1-23-227']
damn it, damn it, damn it. this is all your fault.:::['1-23-228']
this is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life.:::['1-23-229']
my son is being born, and i should be in there, you know?:::['1-23-230']
instead i'm stuck in a closet with you.:::['1-23-231']
i've been waiting for this just as much as you have.:::['1-23-232']
believe me, no one has been waiting for this as much as i have, okay?:::['1-23-233']
and you know what the funny thing is?:::['1-23-234']
when this day is over, you get to go home with the baby.:::['1-23-235']
where does that leave me? - you get to be the father.:::['1-23-236']
everyone knows who you are. who am i? there's father's day. there's mother's day.:::['1-23-237']
there's no lesbian lover day.:::['1-23-238']
every day is lesbian lover day.:::['1-23-239']
this is so great.:::['1-23-240', '1-17-119', '2-22-125']
you wanna explain that?:::['1-23-241']
i mean, well, because when i was growing up, you know, my dad left......and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail.:::['1-23-242']
so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one.:::['1-23-243']
and here's this little baby who has like three whole parents......who care about it so much that they fight over who gets to love it the most......and it's not even born yet.:::['1-23-244']
it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.:::['1-23-245']
i'm sorry. you were fighting.:::['1-23-246']
where are they?:::['1-23-247']
i'm sure they'll be here soon. - they wouldn't miss this.:::['1-23-248']
relax. you're only at nine centimeters, and the baby's at zero station.:::['1-23-249']
okay, you are really frightening me.:::['1-23-250']
somebody wanna help me? trying to rip out my heart.:::['1-23-251']
uh... oh, that's great. anybody seen a nipple?:::['1-23-252']
all right. ten centimeters. here we go.:::['1-23-253']
all right, honey, time to start pushing. - but they're not here yet.:::['1-23-254']
sorry, i can't tell the baby to wait for them.:::['1-23-255']
okay, got the vent open.:::['1-23-257']

i'm your aunt monica.:::['1-23-330']

ben......i want you to know that there may be some times......when i may not be around......like this.:::['1-23-333']
but i'll still always come back......like this.:::['1-23-334', '1-23-336']
and sometimes i may be away longer......like this.:::['1-23-335']
and sometimes i'll want you to steal third, and i'll go like this.:::['1-23-337']
oh, he is so amazing.:::['1-23-338']
yeah, i know. look at him.:::['1-23-339']
hey, ben.:::['1-23-341', '2-2-2']
nothing. i don't think that's his name.:::['1-23-342']
oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.:::['1-23-343']
oh, look, he's opening his eyes.:::['1-23-344']
he doesn't do much, does he?:::['1-23-345']
nope, this is pretty much it.:::['1-23-346']
you guys wanna get some coffee? all: yeah.:::['1-23-347']
all right, i'll see you guys later.:::['1-23-348']
hi, ben.:::['1-23-349', '5-18-265']
i love you. - hi, ben.:::['1-23-350']
oh, look, he's closing his eyes again.:::['1-23-351']
how'd someone get your credit card number?:::['1-21-0']
i have no idea. look how much they spent!:::['1-21-1']
calm down. you only have to pay for the stuff you bought.:::['1-21-2']
still, it's just such reckless spending.:::['1-21-3']
when somebody steals your credit card......they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind.:::['1-21-4']
wow, what a geek. they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop.:::['1-21-5']
that's me.:::['1-21-6', '8-8-132']
oh! oh, the yuck.:::['1-21-7']
he's doing it again!:::['1-21-8']
marcel, stop humping the lamp!:::['1-21-9']
stop humping! now, marcel, come back!:::['1-21-10']
come here, marcel!:::['1-21-11']
oh, no, no! not in my room! i'll get him.:::['1-21-12']
you've got to do something about the humping.:::['1-21-13']
what? it's just a phase.:::['1-21-14']
well, that's what we said about joey.:::['1-21-15']
hey, would you all relax? it's not that big a deal.:::['1-21-16']
rachel: marcel, stop it! marcel! bad monkey!:::['1-21-17']
what? rachel: ugh!:::['1-21-18']
let's just say my curious george doll is no longer curious.:::['1-21-19']
friends s01e21: the one with the fake monica:::['1-21-20']
ugh, monica, you are not still going over that thing.:::['1-21-21']
this woman's living my life. - what?:::['1-21-22']
she's living my life, and she's doing it better than me.:::['1-21-23']
look at this. look.:::['1-21-24']
she buys tickets to plays i want to see.:::['1-21-25']
she shops at stores that i'm intimidated by the salespeople.:::['1-21-26']
she spent $300 on art supplies.:::['1-21-27']
you're not an artist.:::['1-21-28']
yeah, well, i might be if i had the supplies.:::['1-21-29']
i mean, i could do all this stuff. only i don't.:::['1-21-30']
oh, monica, come on. you do cool things.:::['1-21-31']
oh, really? let's compare, shall we?:::['1-21-32']
oh, it's so late for "shall we?":::['1-21-33']
do i go horseback riding in the park, hmm?:::['1-21-34']
do i take classes at the new school?:::['1-21-35']
no. - no.:::['1-21-36', '1-16-315', '1-13-199']
this is so unfair.:::['1-21-37']
she's got everything i want, and she doesn't have my mother.:::['1-21-38']
how about joey paponi?:::['1-21-39']
no, still too ethnic. my agent thinks i should have a name that's more neutral.:::['1-21-40']
joey switzerland?:::['1-21-41']
plus i think it should be joe. joey makes me sound like i'm......this big.:::['1-21-42']
which i'm not!:::['1-21-43']
joe, joe, joe... stalin?:::['1-21-44']
stalin.:::['1-21-45']
do i know that name? that sounds familiar.:::['1-21-46']
well, it does not ring a bell with me. - huh.:::['1-21-47']
joe stalin.:::['1-21-48']
you know, that's pretty good.:::['1-21-49']
you might want to try joseph. - ah!:::['1-21-50']
joseph stalin!:::['1-21-51']
i think you'd remember that! - oh, yes!:::['1-21-52']
bye bye birdie, starring joseph stalin.:::['1-21-53']
joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof.:::['1-21-54']
hey. - hey.:::['1-21-55', '1-21-115', '1-20-275', '1-17-235', '1-16-198', '1-13-157', '2-8-121', '2-10-114', '2-9-70', '2-9-217', '2-16-29', '2-16-267', '2-15-162', '2-15-222', '2-14-0', '2-19-40', '2-18-248', '2-18-343', '2-4-103', '2-20-104', '2-20-277']
hi. uh, yes, this is monica geller.:::['1-21-57']
um, i'm taking classes with you, and i was wondering what they were.:::['1-21-58']
all right, great.:::['1-21-60']
great. thanks a lot.:::['1-21-61']
i'm going to tap class.:::['1-21-62']
so you can dance with the woman that stole your card?:::['1-21-63']
she's got my life. i want to see who she is.:::['1-21-64']
go to the post office! i'm sure her picture's up!:::['1-21-65']
honey, you're kind of losing it here.:::['1-21-66']
this is really becoming a weird obsession.:::['1-21-67']
this is madness, i tell you.:::['1-21-68']
for the love of god, monica, don't do it!:::['1-21-69']
what do you think?:::['1-21-71', '1-2-310', '9-7-264', '10-12-332', '3-23-309']
lots of things.:::['1-21-72']
which one do you think she is?:::['1-21-73']
may i help you? - oh, no, thanks.:::['1-21-74']
we're just here to observe.:::['1-21-75']
you don't observe a dance class. you dance a dance class!:::['1-21-76']
spare shoes are over there.:::['1-21-77']
what does she mean?:::['1-21-78']
i think she means, "you dance......a dance class!":::['1-21-79']
come on, come on, come on!:::['1-21-80']
rachel: really?:::['1-21-81']
hey, do you see anybody you think could be me?:::['1-21-82']
people, last time there were yogurt containers lying around after class.:::['1-21-83']
let's not have that happen again!:::['1-21-84']
she could be you.:::['1-21-85']
let's get started.:::['1-21-86']
five, six. five, six, seven, eight.:::['1-21-87']
okay, i'm not getting this!:::['1-21-88']
i'm totally getting it!:::['1-21-89']
do you ever just feel like you're so unbelievably uncoordinated?:::['1-21-90']
what? you just click when they click.:::['1-21-91']
all right. now everyone grab a partner.:::['1-21-92']
oh! oh.:::['1-21-93', '5-21-232', '3-8-99']
all right. and my dead mother said you are it! i'm with rachel.:::['1-21-94']
great, it's gym class all over again.:::['1-21-95']
rachel & phoebe: aww.:::['1-21-96']
that's all right. you can come up to the front and dance with me.:::['1-21-97']
why don't i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare?:::['1-21-98']
it's okay, it's okay! i'm here, i'm here. i'm so sorry i'm late.:::['1-21-99']
okay, here i am.:::['1-21-100']
so who's the new tense girl?:::['1-21-101']
she's your partner.:::['1-21-102']
hi, i'm monica. - hi.:::['1-21-103']
oh, ha.:::['1-21-104']
monica.:::['1-21-105', '1-21-233', '2-5-117', '5-8-160', '5-9-310', '4-9-278', '3-24-185']
hi, i'm mon...:::['1-21-106']
nana.:::['1-21-107']
monana? - yeah.:::['1-21-108']
it's dutch.:::['1-21-109']
you're kidding. i spent three years in amsterdam.:::['1-21-110']
um, pennsylvania dutch.:::['1-21-111']
and we're dancing!:::['1-21-112']
five, six, seven, eight.:::['1-21-113']
where have you been? - i just got back from the vet.:::['1-21-116']
she's not gonna make you wear a big plastic cone, is she?:::['1-21-117']
she says marcel's humping thing is not a phase.:::['1-21-118']
apparently, he's reached sexual maturity.:::['1-21-119']
hey, he beat you!:::['1-21-120']
she says, as time goes on, he'll start getting aggressive and violent.:::['1-21-121']
what does this mean?:::['1-21-122', '7-1-164']
i have to give him up.:::['1-21-123']
i can't believe it. this sucks!:::['1-21-124']
you just got him. how could he be an adult already?:::['1-21-125']
i know, i know. one day he's this little thing......and before you know it, he's this little thing......i can't get off my leg.:::['1-21-126']
isn't there any way you can keep him?:::['1-21-127']
the vet said that unless he's in a place where he has regular access......to some monkey loving......he's just gonna get vicious.:::['1-21-129']
i just gotta get him into a zoo.:::['1-21-130']
how do you get a monkey into a zoo? - i know that one!:::['1-21-131']
no, that's popes into a volkswagen.:::['1-21-132']
we're applying to a lot of them. our first choice would be a state zoo.:::['1-21-133']
you know, like, uh, san diego.:::['1-21-134']
right?:::['1-21-135', '1-24-288', '8-24-254', '5-20-188', '4-24-255', '3-4-117']
but that may just be a pipe dream because he's out-of-state.:::['1-21-136']
my vet knows someone at miami, so that's a possibility.:::['1-21-137']
but that's two blocks from the beach. it's a total party zoo.:::['1-21-138']
hi. - we found the girl!:::['1-21-140']
what? - did you call the cops?:::['1-21-141']
nope. we took her to lunch.:::['1-21-142']
ah. your own brand of vigilante justice.:::['1-21-143']
are you insane? this woman stole from you!:::['1-21-144']
she stole! she's a stealer!:::['1-21-145']
after you're with this woman for 10 minutes, you forget all that.:::['1-21-146']
i mean, she's this astounding person......with this amazing spirit!:::['1-21-147']
yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader!:::['1-21-148']
take off their hats. - popes in a volkswagen!:::['1-21-149']
i love that joke.:::['1-21-151']
no way! no way did you do this! - monana was very brave.:::['1-21-152']
it was so wild.:::['1-21-153']
we told them we were the gunnersons in room 615......only to find out the boston celtics had the entire sixth floor!:::['1-21-154']
so when they caught on to the fact that we're short and have breasts...:::['1-21-155']
they threw us out. i was thrown out of a hotel! me!:::['1-21-156']
go, monana!:::['1-21-157']
well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream.:::['1-21-158']
i get to go pour coffee for people i don't know. don't wait up.:::['1-21-159']
oh, by the way......tomorrow we're auditioning for a broadway show.:::['1-21-160']
there's an open call for cats.:::['1-21-162']
i'm thinking we go down there, sing "memories"......and make complete fools of ourselves. what do you say?:::['1-21-163']
remember who you're dealing with here. ha.:::['1-21-165']
i'm not like you. i can't even stand in front of a tap class.:::['1-21-166']
that's because of your amish background.:::['1-21-167']
what? - well, you're pennsylvania dutch, right?:::['1-21-168']
till i bought a blow dryer. then i was shunned.:::['1-21-170']
i was just like you.:::['1-21-171']
and then one day, i saw a movie that changed my life.:::['1-21-172']
did you ever see dead poets society? - uh-huh.:::['1-21-173']
i thought that movie was so incredibly......boring!:::['1-21-174']
i mean, that thing at the end where the kid......kills himself because he can't be in the play?:::['1-21-175']
it's like, "kid, wait a year. leave home, do some community theater!":::['1-21-177']
i walked out of there, and i thought::::['1-21-178']
"now, that's two hours of my life that i'm never getting back!":::['1-21-179']
and that scared me more than all the other crap i was afraid to do.:::['1-21-180']
then i would definitely not recommend mrs. doubtfire.:::['1-21-182']
we didn't get into scranton.:::['1-21-184']
that was our safety zoo.:::['1-21-185']
they take, like, dogs and cows.:::['1-21-186']
see?:::['1-21-187', '1-15-182', '8-2-138', '9-23-43', '7-9-141', '7-10-287', '10-13-214', '5-20-29', '5-20-263', '5-14-180', '4-15-319']
i don't know who this is harder on, me or him.:::['1-21-188']
i'd say that chair's taking the brunt of it.:::['1-21-189']
ross: marcel. marcel.:::['1-21-190']
marcel, no.:::['1-21-191']
good boy!:::['1-21-192']
see? how can nobody want him?:::['1-21-193']
somebody will.:::['1-21-194']
you know there already is a joseph stalin?:::['1-21-195']
you're kidding!:::['1-21-196']
apparently, he was this russian dictator who slaughtered all these people!:::['1-21-197']
you'd think you would've known that! - you'd think i would've.:::['1-21-198']
phoebe, what do you think a good stage name for me would be?:::['1-21-199']
flame boy!:::['1-21-200']
where exactly is your zoo?:::['1-21-201']
well, it's technically not a zoo per se.:::['1-21-202']
it's, uh, more of an interactive wildlife experience.:::['1-21-203']
let me ask you some questions about... is it, uh, marcel?:::['1-21-204']
yes. - yes. uh...:::['1-21-205']
does he, uh, fight with other animals?:::['1-21-206']
no, no. he's very docile.:::['1-21-207']
hmm. even if he were cornered?:::['1-21-208']
well, i don't know. why?:::['1-21-209']
um, how is he at handling small objects?:::['1-21-210']
he can hold a banana, if that's what you mean.:::['1-21-211']
what about a hammer or a small blade?:::['1-21-212']
why would he need a blade?:::['1-21-213']
if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns......you got to give the little guy something.:::['1-21-214']
otherwise, it's just cruel!:::['1-21-215']
he got into san diego!:::['1-21-216']
what? - yeah.:::['1-21-217']
we were coming back from our walk, and the phone was ringing...:::['1-21-218']
he's in! - he's in? ah!:::['1-21-219']
did you hear that, marcel?:::['1-21-220']
san diego! san diego! yeah!:::['1-21-221']
you're making a mistake. san diego's well and good......but if you give him to me, i'll start him against a blind rabbit......and give you 20 percent of the gate.:::['1-21-222']
yo-ho!:::['1-21-223']
monica and i just crashed an embassy party.:::['1-21-225']
are you drunk?:::['1-21-226']
i'm lying.:::['1-21-228']
i am so drunk!:::['1-21-229']
oh, god!:::['1-21-230', '8-13-150', '8-22-241', '5-10-170', '5-12-106', '3-24-270']
ugh. great. you know what? you could have called.:::['1-21-231']
i've been up here. i've been worried...:::['1-21-232']
monica?:::['1-21-234', '1-2-309', '9-17-340', '7-21-97', '2-15-69', '2-23-46', '5-23-23', '5-23-25']
water rules!:::['1-21-235']
yes. yes, it does.:::['1-21-236']
the restaurant called. they want to know if you're showing up.:::['1-21-237']
nope!:::['1-21-238']
i'm going to the big apple circus today.:::['1-21-239']
what are you doing? you're gonna lose your job. this is not you!:::['1-21-240']
no, it is me!:::['1-21-241']
i'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows......and pay the bills as soon as they come in!:::['1-21-242']
you know, when i'm with her, i'm so much more than that!:::['1-21-243']
i'm...:::['1-21-244', '1-2-212', '9-21-24']
i'm monana!:::['1-21-245']
ahem, hello?:::['1-21-246']
yes, she is. hold on a second, please.:::['1-21-247']
ahem, monana, it's for you.:::['1-21-248']
the credit card people.:::['1-21-249']
they've arrested monica.:::['1-21-255']
how are you?:::['1-21-257', '2-22-319', '5-12-69', '4-3-144']
i'm not too bad. fortunately, blue's my color.:::['1-21-258']
how did you know i was here?:::['1-21-259']
because......i'm monica geller.:::['1-21-260']
it was my credit card you were using.:::['1-21-261']
that i was not expecting.:::['1-21-262']
i want you to know, i didn't turn you in.:::['1-21-263']
thanks. - no, thank you.:::['1-21-265']
you have given me so much.:::['1-21-266']
if it wasn't for you, i'd never have gotten......to sing "memories" at the winter garden theater.:::['1-21-267']
actually, you only got to sing "memo...":::['1-21-268']
i can't believe you're in here. what am i gonna do without you?:::['1-21-269']
who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me?:::['1-21-270']
who's gonna take me to the big apple circus?:::['1-21-271']
monica, i started my day by peeing in front of 25 other women......and you're worried about who will take you to the big apple circus?:::['1-21-272']
well, not worried, you know, just wondering.:::['1-21-273']
there's nothing to wonder about.:::['1-21-274']
you'll go back to being who you were because that's who you are.:::['1-21-275']
not necessarily. - yes, necessarily.:::['1-21-276']
i don't know what it is. maybe it's the amish thing.:::['1-21-277']
um, i'm not actually amish.:::['1-21-278']
really? then why are you like that?:::['1-21-279']
you by the door, in or out?:::['1-21-280']
in!:::['1-21-281']
you in the back, you're getting it wrong!:::['1-21-282']
at least i'm doing it!:::['1-21-283']
...boarding at gate 42a.:::['1-21-284']
okay, goodbye, little monkey guy.:::['1-21-285']
i wrote you this poem. - aw.:::['1-21-286']
okay, but don't eat it till you get on the plane.:::['1-21-287']
thank you, aunt phoebe. - aww.:::['1-21-288']
okay, bye, champ.:::['1-21-289']
there's gonna be a lot of babes in san diego......but remember, there's also a lot to learn.:::['1-21-290']
i don't know what to say, ross. uh, it's a monkey.:::['1-21-291']

you've been more than just a pet to me.:::['1-21-306']

okay. marcel, would you...?:::['1-21-308']
marcel, would you leave my leg alone?:::['1-21-309']
would you just stop humping me for two seconds? marc... would you...?:::['1-21-310']
okay, would you just take him away? just take him.:::['1-21-311']
o! that i were a glove upon that hand......that i might touch thy cheek.:::['1-21-312']

man: name? - holden mcgroin.:::['1-21-316']
i can't believe you would actually say that.:::['1-20-0']
i would much rather be mr. peanut than mr. salty.:::['1-20-1']
no way. mr. salty is a sailor, all right?:::['1-20-2']
he's gotta be, like, the toughest snack there is.:::['1-20-3']
i don't know. you don't wanna mess with corn nuts.:::['1-20-4']
they're crazy.:::['1-20-5']
oh, my god. oh, my god. you gotta come see this.:::['1-20-6']
there's some creep out there with a telescope.:::['1-20-7']
i can't believe it. he's looking right at us.:::['1-20-8']
oh, that is so sick.:::['1-20-9']
i feel violated.:::['1-20-10', '1-6-14']
and not in a good way.:::['1-20-11']
how can people do that?:::['1-20-12']
oh, you guys, look. ugly naked guy got gravity boots.:::['1-20-13']
friends s01e20: the one with the evil orthodontist:::['1-20-14']
i'm telling you, years from now, school children will study it......as one of the greatest first dates of all time.:::['1-20-15']
it was unbelievable.:::['1-20-16']
we could totally be ourselves. we didn't have to play any games.:::['1-20-17']
so have you called her yet? - let her know i like her? are you insane?:::['1-20-18']
guys. it's gross.:::['1-20-19']
it's the next day. how needy do i wanna seem?:::['1-20-20']
i'm right. right?:::['1-20-21']
let her dangle. - yeah, definitely.:::['1-20-22']
i can't believe my parents are pressuring me......to find one of you people.:::['1-20-24']
god. come on. just do it.:::['1-20-25']
call her. stop being so testosterone-y.:::['1-20-26']
which, by the way, is the real san francisco treat.:::['1-20-27']
i got her machine. - her answering machine?:::['1-20-28']
no, interestingly enough, her leaf blower picked up.:::['1-20-29']
so, um, why didn't you say anything?:::['1-20-30']
oh, no, no, no. last time i left a spontaneous message......i ended up using the phrase, "yes, indeed-io.":::['1-20-31']
monica: look, it's rachel and barry. no, no, don't everybody look at once.:::['1-20-32']
okay, okay. what's going on? - okay, they're just talking.:::['1-20-33']
yeah, well, does he look upset?:::['1-20-34']
does he look like he was just told to shove anything?:::['1-20-35']
no. no, actually, he's smiling.:::['1-20-36']
oh, my god. don't do that.:::['1-20-37']
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon.:::['1-20-39']
and basically, that's how a bill becomes a law.:::['1-20-41']
group: oh.:::['1-20-42', '1-11-61', '7-1-42', '2-3-220']
see? hey, rach. - hey.:::['1-20-43']
how'd it go?:::['1-20-44']
you know, it was, uh... it was actually really great.:::['1-20-45']
took me to lunch at the russian tea room.:::['1-20-46']
i had that chicken, you know, where you poke it and butter squirts out.:::['1-20-47']
not a good day for birds.:::['1-20-48']
and then we took a walk to bendel's.:::['1-20-49']
and i told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of chanel.:::['1-20-50']
that's nice. now was that before or after you told him......to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, huh?:::['1-20-51']
right. well, we never actually got to that.:::['1-20-52']
oh, it was just so nice to see him again, you know? it was...:::['1-20-53']
it was comfortable and it was familiar.:::['1-20-54']
it was just nice.:::['1-20-55']
that's "nice" twice.:::['1-20-56']
rachel, what's going on?:::['1-20-57']
isn't this the same barry who you left at the altar?:::['1-20-58']
duh. where have you been?:::['1-20-59']
yeah, but it was different with him today.:::['1-20-60']
he wasn't, like, orthodontist guy, you know?:::['1-20-61']
i mean, we had fun. is there anything wrong with that?:::['1-20-62']
why? - i have my reasons.:::['1-20-64']
okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman......who just happens to be your ex-best friend?:::['1-20-65']
all right. all right, all right, all right. i know it's stupid.:::['1-20-66']
i'll go see him this afternoon and i will just put an end to it.:::['1-20-67']
wow. - ha, ha.:::['1-20-69']
i'm not crazy, right? i mean, it was never like that.:::['1-20-71']
no, it wasn't.:::['1-20-72']
oh. it was so nice having this little sink here.:::['1-20-73']
"oh, danielle, i wasn't expecting the machine.:::['1-20-74']
give me a call when you get a chance.":::['1-20-75']
bye-bye.:::['1-20-76', '1-15-249', '9-13-353', '7-10-0', '3-18-318', '3-9-282', '3-4-195', '3-6-22']
that's what you've been working on for the past two hours?:::['1-20-78']
hey, i've been honing.:::['1-20-79']
what was with the dishes?:::['1-20-80']
oh, uh, i wanted her to think i might be in a restaurant......you know, i might have some kind of life.:::['1-20-81']
like i haven't been sitting around here honing for the last two hours?:::['1-20-82']
he's doing it again. the guy with the telescope.:::['1-20-83']
phoebe: oh, my god.:::['1-20-84', '1-19-188']
oh. go away. stop looking in here!:::['1-20-85']
great. now he's waving back.:::['1-20-86']
we gotta do something about that guy.:::['1-20-87']
this morning, i caught him looking into our apartment.:::['1-20-88']
it creeps me out. i feel like i can't do stuff.:::['1-20-89']
what kind of stuff?:::['1-20-90']
will you grow up? i'm not talking about sexy stuff......but, like, when i'm cooking naked.:::['1-20-91']
you cook naked?:::['1-20-92']
yeah, toast, oatmeal. nothing that spatters.:::['1-20-93']
what are you looking at me for? i didn't know that.:::['1-20-94']
oh, i just... oh, barry, this was not good.:::['1-20-96']
no, it was. it was very, very good.:::['1-20-97']
what about mindy? - oh, way better than mindy.:::['1-20-98']
no, not that. i mean, what about you and mindy?:::['1-20-99']
oh. if you want, i'll just break it off with her.:::['1-20-100']
no, don't do that. not for me.:::['1-20-102']
bernice: dr. farber, bobby rush is here for his adjustment.:::['1-20-103']
thanks, bernice.:::['1-20-104']
let's go away this weekend.:::['1-20-105']
oh, barry. come on. this is all way too...:::['1-20-106']
no, we can go to aruba.:::['1-20-107']
when i went there on what would've been our honeymoon......it was, uh... it was really nice. you would've liked it.:::['1-20-108']
i had a bra.:::['1-20-109']
hey, dr. farber.:::['1-20-110']
all right, miss green, everything looks fine.:::['1-20-111']
yep, i think we're starting to see some real progress here.:::['1-20-112']
what? - i'm 12, i'm not stupid.:::['1-20-113']
can i use your phone? - yeah.:::['1-20-114']
uh, but for future reference, um, that thing in your hand......can also be used as a phone.:::['1-20-115']
yes, it's working.:::['1-20-116']
why isn't she calling me back?:::['1-20-117']
maybe she never got your message.:::['1-20-118']
you know, you could call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps......that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.:::['1-20-119']
you don't think that makes me seem...? - desperate? needy? pathetic?:::['1-20-120']
ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.:::['1-20-121']
how many beeps? - she answered.:::['1-20-122']
you see, this is where you'd use that "hello" word we talked about.:::['1-20-123']
i'm not going to. she obviously got my message......and is choosing not to call me. now i'm needy and snubbed.:::['1-20-124']
god, i miss just being needy.:::['1-20-125']
group: hey.:::['1-20-126', '4-17-177', '4-4-173']

uh, rach. how come you have dental floss in your hair?:::['1-20-129']
oh, do i?:::['1-20-130']
we ended up having sex in his chair.:::['1-20-131']

i said that a little too loudly, didn't i?:::['1-20-133']
you had what?:::['1-20-134']
sex in his chair.:::['1-20-135']
i don't know. i mean, we still care about each other.:::['1-20-138']
there's a history there. it's like you and carol.:::['1-20-139']
it's nothing like me and carol.:::['1-20-141']
please. if she said to you, "ross, i want you on this couch......right here, right now," what would you say?:::['1-20-142']
if it helps i could slide over.:::['1-20-143']
it's a totally different situation.:::['1-20-144']
it's apples and oranges. it's orthodontists and lesbians...:::['1-20-145']
i gotta go.:::['1-20-146']
where are you going? - i just have to go, all right?:::['1-20-147']
do i need a reason, huh? i have things to do with my life.:::['1-20-148']
i have a jam-packed schedule.:::['1-20-149']

please, i haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me.:::['1-20-177']
i mean, what else is it about?:::['1-20-178']
she was my best friend, you guys.:::['1-20-179']
we went to camp together......she taught me how to kiss... - yeah?:::['1-20-180']
now, you know, i'm, like, the other woman.:::['1-20-181']
ugh, i feel so... - naughty.:::['1-20-182']
i'll see you guys later. - i'll walk out with you.:::['1-20-183']
when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp......and were you wearing any kind of little uniform or...?:::['1-20-184']
that's fine, yeah.:::['1-20-185']
okay, i'm gonna go the bathroom. will you watch my phone?:::['1-20-186']
why don't you just take it with you? - hey.:::['1-20-187']
we haven't been on a second date. she needs to hear me pee?:::['1-20-188']
why don't you just call her?:::['1-20-189']
i can't call her. i left a message. i have some pride.:::['1-20-190']
do you? - no.:::['1-20-191']
danielle, hi.:::['1-20-192']

ahem. oh, okay. that's fine. that's great. okay.:::['1-20-197']
she's on the other line. she's gonna call me back.:::['1-20-198']
she's on the other line, gonna call me back.:::['1-20-199']
don't you have to pee? - that's why i'm dancing.:::['1-20-200']
mindy. - hey, you.:::['1-20-201']
hey, you.:::['1-20-202', '2-15-334']
so, what's up?:::['1-20-203', '3-23-194']
um, we should really be sitting for this.:::['1-20-204']
sure we should.:::['1-20-206']
so... - now, i know things have been weird lately.:::['1-20-207']
but you're my oldest friend, except for laurie schaefer......who i don't talk to anymore......because she's bitter that she lost the weight......and it turns out, she doesn't have a pretty face.:::['1-20-208']
okay, i'm gonna just ask you this once, and i want a straight answer.:::['1-20-209']
will you be my maid of honor?:::['1-20-211']
of course! - oh, that's so great!:::['1-20-212']
it is! it is!:::['1-20-213']
is that all you wanted to ask? - that's all.:::['1-20-214']
that's not all.:::['1-20-216']
oh, sure it is. - oh, no, it isn't. no.:::['1-20-217']
i think barry's seeing someone in the city.:::['1-20-218']
what would make you think that?:::['1-20-219']
well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's acted weird.:::['1-20-220']
and then last night, he came home smelling like chanel.:::['1-20-221']
mindy, if it'll make you feel any better......when barry and i got engaged, he went through a weird thing too.:::['1-20-223']
oh, god. you see, that's what i was afraid of.:::['1-20-224']
what? what's what you were afraid of? - okay, okay.:::['1-20-225']
when barry was engaged to you, he and i......kind of had a little thing on the side.:::['1-20-226']
what? - i know, i know.:::['1-20-227']
when he proposed to me, everyone said, "don't do it.:::['1-20-228']
he's gonna do to you what he did to rachel." and now i feel so stupid.:::['1-20-229']
ha, ha.:::['1-20-230', '1-10-201', '7-4-198', '4-18-1', '3-18-98', '3-25-143', '3-13-23']

rachel: mm-hm.:::['1-20-236', '9-2-55', '5-22-115', '4-14-29', '3-4-102']

i still got a week left in the program, and according to the rules......if i want to get the money, i'm not allowed to conduct any personal experiments......if you know what i mean. - joey, we always know what you mean.:::['1-24-41']
phoebe: hey. ross: hey.:::['1-24-42']
how long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?:::['1-24-43']
i'm going to china.:::['1-24-44']
jeez, you say one thing and, eh...:::['1-24-45']
you're going to china?:::['1-24-46']
it's, uh, for the museum. someone found a bone.:::['1-24-47']
we want the bone, they don't want us to have it.:::['1-24-48']
so i'm going to try to persuade them... it's a whole big "bone" thing.:::['1-24-49']
anyway, i'm gonna be gone for, like, a week.:::['1-24-50']
so, uh, if you wanna reach me, you can't. so here's my itinerary.:::['1-24-51']
here's a picture of me. - oh, let me see.:::['1-24-53']
could you take it to carol's now and then and show it to ben so he doesn't forget me?:::['1-24-54']
yeah. - hi, ben.:::['1-24-55']
i'm your father.:::['1-24-56']
i am the head! pahh!:::['1-24-57']
this barbecue's gonna be very fun.:::['1-24-58']
is rachel here? um, i wanted to wish her a happy birthday before i left.:::['1-24-59']
oh, no, she's out having drinks with carl. - oh. heh.:::['1-24-60']
hey, who's carl?:::['1-24-61']
the guy she met at the coffeehouse? - no.:::['1-24-62']
see, there's this guy she met at... - the coffeehouse? right.:::['1-24-63']
so you do know who he is. heh.:::['1-24-64']
i'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys.:::['1-24-65']
hey, you know what? tell them that bone story.:::['1-24-66']
i have to go to china. - the country?:::['1-24-69']
no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront.:::['1-24-70']
do you guys know who carl is?:::['1-24-71']
let's see. alvin, simon, theodore...:::['1-24-72']
well, rachel's having drinks with him. - oh, no!:::['1-24-74']
how can she, when she's never shown interest in you?:::['1-24-75']
forget about her.:::['1-24-76']
he's right, man. please move on. go to china. eat chinese food.:::['1-24-77']
of course, there they just call it food.:::['1-24-78']
yeah? i guess. i don't know.:::['1-24-79']
all right, just give her this for me, okay?:::['1-24-80']
listen, we're just looking out for you.:::['1-24-81']
i know. - we want you to be happy.:::['1-24-82']
and i may only have a couple beers in me, but i love you, man.:::['1-24-83']
i'm still on my first.:::['1-24-84']
i just think you're nice.:::['1-24-85']
anyway, that's when me and my friends started this fruit-basket business.:::['1-24-86']
we call ourselves "the three basketeers." ha, ha.:::['1-24-87']
like "the three musketeers," only with fruit.:::['1-24-88']
how do you like your burgers? - no. presents first, food later!:::['1-24-91']
hold on there, tiger.:::['1-24-92']
how's it going? how you holding up?:::['1-24-93']
well, not so good.:::['1-24-94']
she thinks tonight's the night we're gonna complete the transaction......if you know what i...:::['1-24-95']
and you do. heh.:::['1-24-96']
so, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?:::['1-24-97']
you know, just be there for her.:::['1-24-99']
not following you.:::['1-24-100']
think about it.:::['1-24-101']
okay, i'm guessing this is from...:::['1-24-102']
well, thank you, melanie.:::['1-24-103']
okay, this one right here is from me. - okay.:::['1-24-104']
hmm. ah, it's light.:::['1-24-105']
it rattles. it's......travel scrabble. - ha, ha, hey!:::['1-24-106']
wow. thank you.:::['1-24-107']
this one's from joey.:::['1-24-108']
it feels like a book. i think it's a book. feels like a book. and it's a book!:::['1-24-109']
it's dr. seuss!:::['1-24-110']
that book got me through some tough times.:::['1-24-111']
there is a little child inside this man.:::['1-24-112']
the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die.:::['1-24-113']
who's this from? - that's, uh, ross'.:::['1-24-114']
he remembered.:::['1-24-117']
remembered what?:::['1-24-118']
it was, like, months ago.:::['1-24-119']
we were walking by this antique store, and i saw this pin in the window.:::['1-24-120']
i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was little.:::['1-24-121']
aw! i can't believe he remembered!:::['1-24-122']
well, sure, but can you play it on a plane?:::['1-24-123']
oh, it's so pretty.:::['1-24-124']
this must've cost him a fortune. - i can't believe he did this.:::['1-24-125']
ross? remember when he fell in love with carol......and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?:::['1-24-126']
what did you just say?:::['1-24-127', '4-21-191']
crystal duck.:::['1-24-128']
the, um... the "love" part?:::['1-24-130']
oh, no, no, no, no.:::['1-24-132', '3-17-140']
that's good. just keep rubbing your head.:::['1-24-133']
that'll turn back time.:::['1-24-134']
this is unbelievable. i mean, this is unbelievable.:::['1-24-135']
i know. this is really, really huge.:::['1-24-136']
no, it's not. it's small, it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.:::['1-24-137']
uh-uh. i don't think any of our lives will ever be the same ever again.:::['1-24-138']
is there a mute button on this woman?:::['1-24-139']
i think this is so great! i mean, you and ross!:::['1-24-140']
did you have any idea? - no, none.:::['1-24-141']
my first night in the city, he mentioned asking me out......but nothing ever happened, so i just...:::['1-24-142']
what else did he say? does he want to go out with me?:::['1-24-143']
given that he's desperately in love with you......he wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something.:::['1-24-144']
all this time?:::['1-24-146']
i've gotta talk to him. - he's in china!:::['1-24-147']
the country.:::['1-24-148']
wait, his flight doesn't leave for 45 minutes.:::['1-24-149']
what about the time difference? from here to the airport?:::['1-24-150']
you're never gonna make it! - i've got to try.:::['1-24-152']
what are you gonna say to him?:::['1-24-153']
chandler: maybe you shouldn't go.:::['1-24-155']
right, because if you're gonna break his heart, that can wait.:::['1-24-156']
yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.:::['1-24-157']
maybe i'll know when i see him.:::['1-24-158']
here, look. all right, does this help?:::['1-24-159']
all i know is, i cannot wait a week. this is just too big.:::['1-24-161']
i've just got to talk to him. i've got...:::['1-24-162']
i'll see you later. - i love you!:::['1-24-163']
deal with me first!:::['1-24-164']
ross! ross.:::['1-24-166']
excuse me, pardon me.:::['1-24-167']
hi. your boarding pass? - hi.:::['1-24-168']
no, i need to talk to my friend.:::['1-24-169']
sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass.:::['1-24-170']
he just went on. he's right there, in the blue jacket! can i just...?:::['1-24-171']
i'm sorry. federal regulations!:::['1-24-172']
all right, um, then could you please just give him a message for me?:::['1-24-173']
please? this is very important.:::['1-24-174']
all right. what's the message?:::['1-24-175']
uh... i don't know.:::['1-24-176']
excuse me! sir! excuse me! sir?:::['1-24-177']
i have a message for you. - what?:::['1-24-178']
it's from rachel. she loved the present. she'll see you when you get back.:::['1-24-179']
toby, i don't know what she's talking about.:::['1-24-181']
there's no rachel!:::['1-24-182', '1-24-307']
don't give me that deep freeze!:::['1-24-183']
oh, joey, joey, joey!:::['1-24-184']
i think i blacked out there for a minute.:::['1-24-185']
it was nothing.:::['1-24-186']
well, now we gotta find something fun for you!:::['1-24-187']
ahh, you know what?:::['1-24-188']
forget about me. let's, uh... let's give you another turn.:::['1-24-189']
me, again?:::['1-24-190']
sure. why not?:::['1-24-191']
boy! somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow!:::['1-24-192']
i gotta tell you, you are nothing like i thought you would be.:::['1-24-193']
how do you mean?:::['1-24-194', '3-13-185']
i just had you pegged as one of those guys who are always, "me, me, me!":::['1-24-195']
ha, ha. - but you......you're a giver.:::['1-24-196']
you're, like, the most generous man i ever met.:::['1-24-197']
i mean, you're practically a woman.:::['1-24-198']
so, uh, rach, do you want to save this wrapping paper?:::['1-24-199']
it's only a little torn.:::['1-24-200']
are you gonna go for it with ross, or should i throw it out?:::['1-24-201']
thought about it all of the way there......and i thought about it all the way back and, uh...:::['1-24-203']
you know, it's ross!:::['1-24-204']
you know what i mean? it's ross.:::['1-24-205']
sure! - sure.:::['1-24-206']
i don't know. this is just my initial gut feeling......but i'm thinking......it'd be really great.:::['1-24-207']
oh, my god, me too! oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!:::['1-24-208']
the best part is you already know everything about him.:::['1-24-209']
it's like starting on the 15th date.:::['1-24-210']
but it would be like starting on the 15th date.:::['1-24-211']
another good point.:::['1-24-212']
at the 15th date, you're already in a "relationship-y" place.:::['1-24-214']
you're committed.:::['1-24-215']
what happens if it doesn't work out?:::['1-24-217']
why isn't it working out? - i don't know, sometimes it doesn't.:::['1-24-218']
is he not cute enough for you? does he not make enough money?:::['1-24-219']
no, i'm just... - maybe there's someone else.:::['1-24-220']
is there? is there someone else?:::['1-24-221']
no, there is no one else. - then why the hell......are you dumping my brother?  - wha...?:::['1-24-222']
hey, big... - shh!:::['1-24-223']
spender.:::['1-24-224']
she's still asleep.:::['1-24-225']
so how'd it go? - it was amazing.:::['1-24-226']
you know how you think you're great in bed?:::['1-24-227']
the fact you'd even ask shows how little you know me.:::['1-24-228']
well, it's like, last night i couldn't do the thing......that usually makes me great.:::['1-24-229']
so i had to do all this other stuff.:::['1-24-230']
and the response i got! man, oh, man.:::['1-24-231']
it was like a ticker-tape parade!:::['1-24-232']
yes i know. as it happens, my room is very close to the parade route.:::['1-24-233']
it was amazing, and not just for her. uh-uh. for me too.:::['1-24-234']
it's like, all of a sudden, i'm blind......but all my other senses are heightened.:::['1-24-235']
you know? it's like, i was able to appreciate it......on another level.:::['1-24-236']
i didn't know you had another level.:::['1-24-237']
i know. neither did i!:::['1-24-238']
hey, great skirts! birthday present? - yeah.:::['1-24-239']
from who? - from you.:::['1-24-240']
i exchanged the blouse you got me.:::['1-24-241']
well, it's the thought.:::['1-24-242']
doesn't ross' flight get in in a couple hours?:::['1-24-243']
at gate 27b?:::['1-24-244']
uh, yeah.:::['1-24-245', '7-2-178', '4-11-13']
monica, you know, i've been thinking about it.:::['1-24-246']
i've decided this ross thing is not a good idea.:::['1-24-247']
why? - because i feel......like i wouldn't just be going out with him.:::['1-24-248']
i would be going out with all of you.:::['1-24-249']
ugh, there'd be all this pressure and... - no pressure, no pressure!:::['1-24-250']
nothing has even happened yet and you're already so...:::['1-24-251']
i'm not "so.":::['1-24-252']
i was a teensy bit weird at first......but i'll be good. i promise.:::['1-24-253']
who is it?:::['1-24-254', '9-8-30', '7-15-220', '10-15-207']
carl: it's me, carl.:::['1-24-255']
come on up.:::['1-24-256', '1-13-105']
behind my brother's back?:::['1-24-257']
is the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.:::['1-24-258']
seven hundred bucks. - all right, you did it.:::['1-24-259']
do we have any fruit?:::['1-24-260']
man, hell of a two weeks, huh?:::['1-24-261']
you know what, though? i really feel i learned something.:::['1-24-262']
so you'll stick with this "it's all for her" thing?:::['1-24-263']
what, are you crazy?:::['1-24-264', '5-23-155']
when a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this?:::['1-24-265']
i'm just saying, if i see one more picture of ed begley jr......in that stupid electric car......i'm gonna shoot myself!:::['1-24-266']
don't get me wrong. i'm not against environmental issues, per se......it's just that guy!:::['1-24-267']
i can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.:::['1-24-268']
excuse me, please. i'm trying to have a date here.:::['1-24-269']
fine, just stop thinking about me.:::['1-24-270']
can't do it, can you?:::['1-24-271']
so i'm thinking about you. so what?:::['1-24-272']
i don't get it. what do you see in this guy anyway?:::['1-24-273']
well, he seems to be a very nice guy.:::['1-24-274']
i mean, come on, buddy! get a real car!:::['1-24-275']
rachel, come on. give us a chance.:::['1-24-276']
ross, it's too hard. - no, no.:::['1-24-277']
because it'll get weird for everyone else?:::['1-24-278']
who cares about them? this is about us.:::['1-24-279']
i've been in love with you since the ninth grade.:::['1-24-280']
you're, like, my best friend. - i know.:::['1-24-281']
if we broke up, and i lost you... - whoa.:::['1-24-282']
why do you think we'll break up?:::['1-24-283']
have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?:::['1-24-284']
but it only has to happen once.:::['1-24-286']
you and i know we are perfect for each other.:::['1-24-287']
so the only question is: are you attracted to me?:::['1-24-289']
i mean, i've never looked at you that way before.:::['1-24-291']
well start looking.:::['1-24-292']
exactly!:::['1-24-294', '9-17-216', '5-7-82']
and you just know i'm gonna be the guy......caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!:::['1-24-295']
right. - heh.:::['1-24-296']
you're right.:::['1-24-297', '1-13-126', '9-1-228', '9-3-217', '10-5-111', '5-6-301', '5-3-166', '3-8-299']
i forgot, i'm supposed to pick up a friend at the airport.:::['1-24-299']
i am so sorry. i'm so...:::['1-24-300']
if you want to stay and finish your drinks, please do.:::['1-24-301']
i'm sorry, i gotta go. i'm sorry.:::['1-24-302']
but...:::['1-24-303', '1-15-140', '2-3-248', '4-16-239', '4-16-279']
excuse me! pardon me! excuse me.:::['1-24-304']
i'm sorry. ha, ha.:::['1-24-305']
toby, for god's sake, will you let it go?:::['1-24-306']
oh, hey. i got that. - oh.:::['1-24-308']
thanks, sweetie. - no problem.:::['1-24-309']
i cannot wait for you to meet my friends.:::['1-24-310']

and then he did.:::['1-18-46']
well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?:::['1-18-47']
yeah, what is that? like some kind of guy thing?:::['1-18-48']
like some kind of sexist guy thing?:::['1-18-49']
like, it's poker, so only guys can play?:::['1-18-50']
no. women are welcome to play.:::['1-18-51']
oh, okay, so then what is it?:::['1-18-52']
some kind of, you know, like, some kind of, you know, like...:::['1-18-53']
all right, what is it?:::['1-18-54']
there just don't happen to be any women in our game.:::['1-18-55']
yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker.:::['1-18-56']
oh, please. that is such a lame excuse. i mean, it's a typical guy response.:::['1-18-57']
excuse me, do any of you know how to play?:::['1-18-58']
but you could teach us.:::['1-18-60']
okay, so now we draw cards.:::['1-18-62']
so i wouldn't need any, right? because i have a straight.:::['1-18-63']
oh, good for you. - congratulations.:::['1-18-64']
okay, pheebs, how many do you want?:::['1-18-65']
okay, i just need two. the 10 of spades and the six of clubs.:::['1-18-66']

i have the 10 of spades. here, you want it?:::['1-18-68']
uh, no, see, uh, you can't do that.:::['1-18-70']
no, no. that's okay. i don't need them. i'm going for fours.:::['1-18-71']
oh, you're...:::['1-18-72']
all right, here we go.:::['1-18-73']
we've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudités.:::['1-18-74']
whoa, whoa, whoa. monica, what are you doing?:::['1-18-75']
this is a poker game. you can't serve food with more than one syllable.:::['1-18-76']
it's got to be like chips or dip or pretz...:::['1-18-77']
okay, so at this point, the dealer...:::['1-18-78']
you know what? we got it. we got it. let's play for real. high stakes. big bucks.:::['1-18-79']
all right, now, you sure? phoebe just threw away two jacks......because they didn't look happy.:::['1-18-80']
but i'm ready. so just deal.:::['1-18-81']
okay, all right, last minute lesson. last minute lesson. joey.:::['1-18-82']
three......eight.:::['1-18-83']
eight, three. all right. here we go.:::['1-18-84']
damn it, damn it, damn it.:::['1-18-85']
i see. so then, um, you were lying.:::['1-18-86']
about what? - about how good your cards were.:::['1-18-87']
heh. i was bluffing.:::['1-18-88']
aha. and what is "bluffing"?:::['1-18-89']
is it not another word for lying?:::['1-18-90']
okay, sorry to break up this party......but i've got résumés to fax before work tomorrow.:::['1-18-91']
ross: whoa, whoa, whoa. - rach, we've got to settle.:::['1-18-92']
settle what?:::['1-18-93']
the jamestown colony of virginia.:::['1-18-94']
you see, king george is giving us the land, so...:::['1-18-95']
the game, rachel. the game. you owe us money for the game.:::['1-18-96']
you know what, guys? it's their first time. why don't we forget about the money?:::['1-18-98']
hell, no. we'll pay.:::['1-18-99']
okay, monica, i had another answer all ready.:::['1-18-100']
and you know what?:::['1-18-101', '8-18-262']
we want a rematch. - well, that's fine with me.:::['1-18-102']
could use the money.:::['1-18-103']
so, basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends.:::['1-18-104']
yeah. - yes, and i get my ya-yas from lkea.:::['1-18-105']
you have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less.:::['1-18-106']
look, rachel, this is poker. i play to win, all right?:::['1-18-107']
in order for me to win, other people have to lose.:::['1-18-108']
so if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a nice guy.:::['1-18-109']
okay, because once those cards are dealt...:::['1-18-110']
i'm not a nice guy.:::['1-18-112']
all right, boys. let's eat.:::['1-18-113']
ah, did you get that from the "i love rachel" pizzeria?:::['1-18-114']
you still on that? - come on.:::['1-18-115']
what was with that whole black bart speech?:::['1-18-116']
"when i play poker, i'm not a nice guy".:::['1-18-117']
you're way off, pal.:::['1-18-118']
no, i don't think so. see, ross, because i think you love her.:::['1-18-119']
uh, no.:::['1-18-120', '1-12-318', '5-1-233']
see, i might have had feelings for her at one time. not anymore.:::['1-18-121']
i just... marcel.:::['1-18-122']
where are you going with that disk? you are not putting that on again.:::['1-18-123']
marcel... okay. if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble.:::['1-18-124']
you believe what a jerk ross was being?:::['1-18-125']
yeah, i know. he can get really competitive.:::['1-18-126']
oh. "hello, kettle, this is monica. you're black.":::['1-18-128']
please.:::['1-18-129', '5-6-259', '5-14-229']
i am not as bad as ross.:::['1-18-130']
oh, i beg to differ. the pictionary incident?:::['1-18-131']
that was not an incident.:::['1-18-132']
i was gesturing and the plate slipped out of my hand.:::['1-18-133']
oh! i got an interview. i got an interview. - you're kidding. where? where?:::['1-18-135']

well, what's the job? - assistant buyer.:::['1-18-138']
oh! i would be shopping......for a living.:::['1-18-139']
okay, look. that's aunt iris.:::['1-18-140']
this woman has been playing poker since she was 5.:::['1-18-141']
you've gotta listen to every word she says.:::['1-18-142']
hi. - is tony randall dead?:::['1-18-143']
oh, why? - i don't think so.:::['1-18-144']
well, he may be now because i think i hit him with my car.:::['1-18-145']
my god. really? - no, that's bluffing. lesson number one.:::['1-18-146']
let me tell you something.:::['1-18-147']
everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap.:::['1-18-148']
nice earrings. - thank you.:::['1-18-149']
girls, sit down.:::['1-18-150']
um, aunt iris, this is phoebe, and rachel... - yeah, yeah, yeah.:::['1-18-151']
listen, i am parked at a meter. let's do it.:::['1-18-152']
ross, could we please, please, listen to anything else?:::['1-18-153']
i'm gonna pay for that tonight.:::['1-18-155']
guess what, guess what, guess what.:::['1-18-157']
uh, okay. the fifth dentist caved, and now they're all recommending trident?:::['1-18-158']
no, the interview.:::['1-18-159']
she loved me. she absolutely loved me.:::['1-18-160']
we talked for, like, two and a half hours. we have the same taste in clothes.:::['1-18-161']
oh, i went to camp with her cousin.:::['1-18-162']
and, oh, the job is perfect. i can do this. i can do this well.:::['1-18-163']
group: that's great.:::['1-18-164']
god. and she told the funniest story.:::['1-18-165']
okay, great, you'll tell us and we'll laugh.:::['1-18-166']
let's play poker.:::['1-18-167']
all right, listen, we talked about it......and if you don't want to play, we completely understand.:::['1-18-168']
yes, yes. we can play some other game. like, i don't know......pictionary?:::['1-18-169']
very funny. very funny.:::['1-18-170']
i think we'd like to give poker another try. shall we, ladies?:::['1-18-171']
both: yes, i think we should.:::['1-18-172']
rach, do you want me to shuffle those?:::['1-18-173']
no, no. that's okay. you know what? i'm gonna give it a go.:::['1-18-174']
ross: all right. - all right.:::['1-18-175']
so pheebs owes 7.50. monica, you owe $10.:::['1-18-176']
and, rachel, you owe 15 big ones.:::['1-18-177']
thanks for teaching us "crossed-eyed mary.":::['1-18-178']
you guys, we gotta play that other way.:::['1-18-179']
all right, here's my 7.50, but i think you should know that this money is cursed.:::['1-18-180']
what? - oh, i cursed it.:::['1-18-181']
so now bad things will happen to he who spends it.:::['1-18-182']
that's all right, i'll take it. bad things happen to me anyway.:::['1-18-183']
this way, i can break them up with a movie.:::['1-18-184']
so that just leaves the big green poker machine, who owes 15.:::['1-18-185']
hmm, oh, it's so typical::::['1-18-186']
"ooh, i'm a man. ooh, i have a penis.:::['1-18-187']
ooh, i have to win money to exert my power over women.":::['1-18-188']
you know what? this is not over.:::['1-18-189']
we will play you again. and we will win and you will lose.:::['1-18-190']
and you will beg and we will laugh.:::['1-18-191']
and we will take every last dime you have.:::['1-18-192']
and you will hate yourselves forever.:::['1-18-193']
hmm. kind of stepped on my point there, mon.:::['1-18-194']
so you gals wanna hand over your money now?:::['1-18-195']
that way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing.:::['1-18-196']
no, that's fine. we'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy.:::['1-18-197']
okay, are we done with the chitchat? are we ready to play serious poker?:::['1-18-198']

i mean, i gave barry up, right? - mm.:::['1-19-29']
i should be happy for them.:::['1-19-30']
i am. i'm happy for them.:::['1-19-31']
really? - no.:::['1-19-32']
oh. oh, i guess it would be different if i were with somebody.:::['1-19-33']
whoa, what, uh, ha, ha...:::['1-19-34']
what happened to, uh, "forget relationships.:::['1-19-35']
i'm done with men"? the whole, uh, penis embargo?:::['1-19-36']
i guess it's not about no guys.:::['1-19-38']
it's about the right guy, you know? - hmm.:::['1-19-39']
with barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat.:::['1-19-40']
mm. - you know, with paolo......that's all there was, was heat.:::['1-19-41']
and i mean, it was just this raw, animal, sexual...:::['1-19-42']
right, right. i got it.:::['1-19-43']
i was there.:::['1-19-44']
i mean, do you think you can ever have both?:::['1-19-45']
you know? someone who's like your best friend......but then also can make your toes curl.:::['1-19-46']
yes, yes.:::['1-19-47']
yes. yes, i do. i really do.:::['1-19-48']
uh, in fact, it's funny.:::['1-19-49']
very often, someone who you wouldn't think could......curl your toes......might just be the one who...:::['1-19-50']
gets interrupted. hi.:::['1-19-52']
hey, guys, how was the movie?:::['1-19-53']
oh, so wonderful. - oh, it was so good.:::['1-19-54']
suck fest. - total chick flick.:::['1-19-55']
i'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies......with, like, you know, like, guns and bombs......and, like, buses going really fast.:::['1-19-56']
hey, i don't need violence to enjoy a movie......just so long as there's a little nudity.:::['1-19-57']
there was nudity. - i meant female nudity.:::['1-19-58']
all right, i don't need to see lou grant frolicking.:::['1-19-59']
monica & chandler & phoebe: hugh. hugh grant.:::['1-19-60']
all right, i've got to go. ahem.:::['1-19-61']
come on, marcel. come on.:::['1-19-62']
yeah, we're gonna go take a bath. yes, we are, aren't we? yes, we are.:::['1-19-63']
they're still just friends, right?:::['1-19-64']
and i will see you tomorrow.:::['1-19-65']
that's right. you're gonna spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's, aren't you?:::['1-19-66']
hang on, hang on. does aunt monica get a say in this?:::['1-19-67']
please, aunt monica, please? ha, ha.:::['1-19-68']
oh, unclench. you're not even gonna be here.:::['1-19-69']
chandler: i can't believe we're having this discussion.:::['1-19-70']
i agree. i'm, like, in disbelief.:::['1-19-71']
don't you think if things were gonna happen with rachel, they would've happened?:::['1-19-72']
i'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship......with someone exactly like me.:::['1-19-73']
she really said that?:::['1-19-74']
well, i added the "exactly like me" part.:::['1-19-75']
but she said she's looking for someone. and someone is gonna be there tonight.:::['1-19-76']
"tonight" tonight?:::['1-19-77']
well, i think it's perfect. it's just gonna be the two of us.:::['1-19-78']
she spent all day taking care of my monkey.:::['1-19-79']
i can't remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey.:::['1-19-80']
anyway, you know, i figured after work, i'd go pick up a bottle of wine......go over there and, uh, try to woo her.:::['1-19-81']
hey, you know what you should do?:::['1-19-82']
you should take her back to the 1890s when that phrase was last used.:::['1-19-83']
if you keep this up......you'll be finished with this sucker by the end of the week.:::['1-19-84']
now, the one in the feathered boa, that's dr. francis.:::['1-19-85']
now, she used to be a man.:::['1-19-86']
oh, look. see, now, there's raven. we hate her.:::['1-19-87']
we're glad she's dying.:::['1-19-88']
and then... what? marcel.:::['1-19-89']
are you playing with monica's shoes? you know you're not supposed to...:::['1-19-90']
marcel, did you poo in the shoe?:::['1-19-92']
oh, marcel. bad monkey.:::['1-19-93']
sorry, barry.:::['1-19-96']
a little engagement gift.:::['1-19-97']
i'm sure you didn't register for that.:::['1-19-98']
who died? who died?:::['1-19-99']
roll him over. oh, come on, roll him over. oh!:::['1-19-100']
well, we know it wasn't dexter, right, marcel? because...:::['1-19-101']
marcel? marcel? marc...?:::['1-19-102']
how could you lose him? - i don't know, i don't know.:::['1-19-103']
we were watching tv, and then he pooped in monica's shoe...:::['1-19-104']
wait. he pooped in my shoe? which one?:::['1-19-105']
i don't know. the left one.:::['1-19-106']
which ones?:::['1-19-107']
oh, those little clunky amish things you think go with everything.:::['1-19-108']
hey. group: hey.:::['1-19-109', '1-15-21', '2-3-0', '2-3-305']
whoa, oh. why is the air in here so negative?:::['1-19-110']
rachel lost marcel. - oh, no. how?:::['1-19-111']
he pooped in my shoe. - which one?:::['1-19-112']
those cute little black ones i wear all the time.:::['1-19-113']
no, which one? ha, ha.:::['1-19-114']
the right or left?:::['1-19-115']
because the left one is lucky.:::['1-19-116']
come on, you guys. what am i gonna do?:::['1-19-117']
all right, all right, all right. you're a monkey......you're loose in the city.:::['1-19-118']
where do you go?:::['1-19-119']
okay, it's his first time out......so he's probably gonna want to do some of the touristy things.:::['1-19-120']
i'll go to cats. you go to the russian tea room.:::['1-19-121']
oh, my god! come on, you guys.:::['1-19-122']

phoebe and i will take third and fourth.:::['1-19-125']
whoa, whoa. what am i gonna do?:::['1-19-126']
okay, you stay here and just wait by the phone.:::['1-19-127']
spray lysol in my shoe and wait for ross to kill you.:::['1-19-128']
does anybody want to trade?:::['1-19-129']
what do you want?:::['1-19-130', '10-12-209']
mr. heckles, our friend lost a monkey. have you seen it?:::['1-19-131']
i left a belgian waffle out here. did you take it?:::['1-19-132']
why would you leave your belgian waffle in the hall?:::['1-19-134']
i wasn't ready for it.:::['1-19-135']
the monkey, have you seen a monkey?:::['1-19-136']
i saw regis philbin once.:::['1-19-137']
thank you, mr. heckles.:::['1-19-138']
you owe me a waffle.:::['1-19-139']
okay, he's a black capuchin monkey with a white face......with russian dressing and pickles on the side.:::['1-19-140']
okay, thanks.:::['1-19-141', '2-17-160', '2-15-94']
hi. - hey. how did it go today?:::['1-19-142']
oh, great. it went great. really great. - yeah.:::['1-19-143']
hey, is that wine? - yeah. yeah.:::['1-19-144']
you, uh, want some?:::['1-19-145']
oh, i would love some. - yeah.:::['1-19-146']
but you know what? you know what? let's not drink it here.:::['1-19-147']
i'm feeling kind of crazy. do you want to go to newark?:::['1-19-148']
uh, okay. yeah.:::['1-19-149']
we could do that. but before we head off to the murder capital of the northeast......i was, uh, kind of wanted to run something by you.:::['1-19-150']
you know how we were, you know, talking before......about relationships and stuff, well...:::['1-19-151']
oh, god, ross, i cannot do this. - okay, quick and painful.:::['1-19-152']
okay, all right. all right, okay.:::['1-19-154']
ross, please don't hate me.:::['1-19-155']
oh, what? what? what?:::['1-19-156']
you know marcel?:::['1-19-157']
yeah? - well, ahem.:::['1-19-158']
i kind of, uh... i kind of lost him.:::['1-19-159']
i mean, all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment.:::['1-19-161']
i know, i know. i'm sorry.:::['1-19-162']
you know what? i guess it's partially my fault.:::['1-19-163']
i shouldn't have asked you to start off with a monkey.:::['1-19-164']
i should have started you off with, like, a pen or a pencil.:::['1-19-165']
ross, i'm doing everything that i can.:::['1-19-166']
i've got everybody looking for him and i got...:::['1-19-167']
see, i've even got animal control. - you called animal control?:::['1-19-168']
why? do you not like them?:::['1-19-170']
heh. marcel is an illegal exotic animal.:::['1-19-171']
i'm not allowed to have him in the city.:::['1-19-172']
if they find him, they'll take him away from me.:::['1-19-173']
okay, well, now, see, you never ever, ever told us that.:::['1-19-174']
that's right, because i didn't expect you we're gonna invite them to the apartment.:::['1-19-175']
hi. thanks for coming.:::['1-19-176']
somebody called about a monkey?:::['1-19-177']
oh. oh, you know what? that was a complete misunderstanding.:::['1-19-178']
yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we didn't.:::['1-19-179']
it turned out it was a hat. - cat.:::['1-19-180']
cat. what did i say?:::['1-19-181']
hi. we checked the third and fourth floor.:::['1-19-182']
no one's seen marcel. - marcel?:::['1-19-183']
my uncle marcel.:::['1-19-184']
oh, is that who the monkey's named after?:::['1-19-185']
are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is punishable......by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal.:::['1-19-187']
you'd put that poor little creature in jail?:::['1-19-189']
pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?:::['1-19-190']
yes, but there isn't always time.:::['1-19-191']
look, i'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this. um, have a seat.:::['1-19-192']
first of all, we haven't been introduced. i'm monica geller.:::['1-19-193']
oh, my god, you are.:::['1-19-194']
and you're rachel green. - yeah.:::['1-19-195']
luisa gianetti. lincoln high?:::['1-19-196']
i sat behind you guys in homeroom.:::['1-19-197']
oh! luisa. oh, my god.:::['1-19-198']
monica. it's luisa!:::['1-19-199']
luisa. from homeroom.:::['1-19-200']
you have no idea who i am, do you? rachel: no.:::['1-19-202']
not at all.:::['1-19-203', '2-10-51']
well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me.:::['1-19-204']
would it have been so hard to say, "morning, luisa"......or "nice overalls"?:::['1-19-205']
it's not so much you. you were fat. you had your own problems.:::['1-19-207']
but you. what a bitch.:::['1-19-208']
you know what? be that as it may.:::['1-19-210']
you think you could you help us out here on that monkey thing, for old times' sake?:::['1-19-211']
go, bobcats.:::['1-19-212']
i could. but i won't.:::['1-19-213']
if i find that monkey, he's mine.:::['1-19-214']
da, da, da:::['1-19-215']
chandler: marcel?:::['1-19-217']
joey: marcel?:::['1-19-218']
marcel? - marcel?:::['1-19-219']
hi, can i help you?:::['1-19-220']
uh, we're kind of having an emergency, and, ahem, we were looking for something.:::['1-19-221']
a monkey. - yes, have you seen any?:::['1-19-222']
no. no, i haven't seen a monkey.:::['1-19-223']
do you know anything about fixing radiators?:::['1-19-224']
sure, sure. did you try turning the knob back the other way?:::['1-19-225']
of course. - oh. then, no.:::['1-19-226']
taste this daiquiri. is there too much rum in here?:::['1-19-227']
just a second. hope you find your monkey.:::['1-19-228']
oh, no, wait. no, no, no. wait, wait.:::['1-19-229']
um, we may not know about radiators, per se......but we do have a certain amount of expertise......in the heating and cooling milieu.:::['1-19-230']
uh, weren't we kind of in the middle of something here?:::['1-19-231']
yes, but these women are very hot and they need our help.:::['1-19-232']
and they're very hot.:::['1-19-233']
we can't, all right?:::['1-19-234']
you have no idea how sorry. but we promised we'd find this monkey.:::['1-19-236']
if you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name marcel.:::['1-19-237']
so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.:::['1-19-238']
okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.:::['1-19-239']
marcel? - marcel.:::['1-19-240']
phoebe & monica: marcel?:::['1-19-241']
marcel?:::['1-19-242']
oh, my god. - what?:::['1-19-243']
something just brushed up against my right leg.:::['1-19-244']
what is it? - oh.:::['1-19-245']
oh, it's okay. it was just my left leg.:::['1-19-246']
monica: look, phoebe.:::['1-19-247']
oh, yeah. oh, marcel. come here.:::['1-19-248']
oh, come here, marcel. - step aside, ladies.:::['1-19-249']
what are you gonna do? - just a small tranquilizer.:::['1-19-250']
phoebe: run, marcel, run! run, marcel!:::['1-19-251']
damn. - are you okay?:::['1-19-252']
oh, yeah, i think so.:::['1-19-253']
oh, gosh.:::['1-19-257', '10-10-239', '2-9-24']
ross & rachel: marcel. marcel.:::['1-19-258']
this is ridiculous. we've been all over the neighborhood.:::['1-19-259']
he's gone. he's just gone.:::['1-19-260']
ross, you don't know that. - oh, come on. it's cold, it's dark.:::['1-19-261']
he doesn't know the village.:::['1-19-262']
and now i have a broken foot. oh, my...:::['1-19-263']
i have no monkey and a broken foot.:::['1-19-264']
thank you very much.:::['1-19-265', '4-20-104', '4-7-164', '3-24-27', '3-15-57']
ross, you know, i've said i'm sorry, like, a million times.:::['1-19-266']
what do you want me to do? huh? you want me to break my foot too?:::['1-19-267']
here, i'm gonna break my foot right now. ow!:::['1-19-268']
oh, my god. there, are you happy now?:::['1-19-269']
yeah, yeah. you know, now that you kicked the sign......hey, ha, ha, i don't miss marcel anymore.:::['1-19-270']
you know, it's not like i did this on purpose.:::['1-19-271']
no, no, no. no, no. this is just vintage rachel.:::['1-19-272']
i mean, things just sort of happen around you.:::['1-19-273']
i mean, you're off in rachel land, doing your rachel thing......totally oblivious to people's monkeys or to people's feelings and...:::['1-19-274']
i don't even want to hear it. - ross.:::['1-19-275']
forget it, okay? - ross.:::['1-19-276']
hey, banana man.:::['1-19-278']
oh, this is so intense.:::['1-19-279']
one side of my butt is totally asleep and the other side has no idea.:::['1-19-280']
hi. did you order some bananas?:::['1-19-281']
what about it? - give me my monkey back.:::['1-19-282']
i don't have a monkey.:::['1-19-283']

okay, give me my monkey back. - that's my monkey.:::['1-19-296']
you're gonna have to take this up with the judge.:::['1-19-297']
that's not my monkey. just the dress is mine.:::['1-19-298']
you can send it back whenever.:::['1-19-299']
all right, i want my monkey. - no.:::['1-19-300']
oh, come on, luisa. - sorry, prom queen.:::['1-19-301']
you had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't have been fat.:::['1-19-302']
all right, look, in high school, i was the prom queen......and i was the homecoming queen and the class president and you......were also there.:::['1-19-303']
look, if you take this monkey......i will lose one of the most important people in my life.:::['1-19-304']
you can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him.:::['1-19-305']
come on, luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here.:::['1-19-306']
take it.:::['1-19-307']
well, then how about i call your supervisor and i tell her......that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart.:::['1-19-310']
hey, it'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it?:::['1-19-311']
or we can leave it on for now. that's fine.:::['1-19-312']
you know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit.:::['1-19-313']
listen...:::['1-19-314', '2-16-361']
i'm sorry i was so hard on you before. you know, i just...:::['1-19-315']
no, ross, come on. no, no. it was my fault. i almost lost your...:::['1-19-316']
no, no. yeah, but you were the one who got him back.:::['1-19-317']
you know, you were great.:::['1-19-318']
hey, we still have that bottle of wine.:::['1-19-319']
are you in the mood for, uh......something grape?:::['1-19-320']
sure, that would be good. - all right, uh...:::['1-19-321']
the, uh... the neighbors must be vacuuming.:::['1-19-323']
well, ah, as long as we're here......and not on the subject, um, ahem...:::['1-19-324']
i was thinking about, uh......how mad we got at each other before.:::['1-19-325']
and, um, i was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we...:::['1-19-326']
rachel? - barry?:::['1-19-327']
i can't. i can't do it. i can't marry mindy.:::['1-19-328']
i'm still in love with you. - oh!:::['1-19-329']

you see the von trapp kids? - no.:::['1-19-332']
that's because i'm in front of them.:::['1-19-333']
yeah, i thought that was an alp.:::['1-19-334']
well, high school was not my favorite time.:::['1-19-335']
i don't know. i loved high school, you know?:::['1-19-336']
it was just, like, four years of parties and dating and sex and...:::['1-19-337']
yeah, well, i went to boarding school with 400 boys.:::['1-19-338']
any sex i had would've involved a major lifestyle choice.:::['1-19-339']
gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?:::['1-19-340']
oh, oh, oh.:::['1-19-341', '3-7-65']

you are an idiot.:::['1-17-49']
yep, that's me. heh. i am that stupid.:::['1-17-50']
i had a dream last night where i was playing football with my kid.:::['1-17-51']

no, no. with him.:::['1-17-53']
i'm on this field, and they hike me the baby.:::['1-17-54']
i know i've gotta do something because the tampa bay defense is coming right at me.:::['1-17-55']
tampa bay's got a terrible team.:::['1-17-56']
right, but......it is just me and the baby, so i'm thinking they can take us.:::['1-17-57']
and so i, uh, heh...:::['1-17-58']
i just heave it downfield.:::['1-17-59']
what are you, crazy? that's a baby.:::['1-17-60']
he should take the sack?:::['1-17-61']
anyway, suddenly i'm downfield.:::['1-17-62']
and i realize that i'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right?:::['1-17-63']
only i know there's no way i'm not gonna get there in time.:::['1-17-64']
so i am running and i'm running......and that is when i woke up.:::['1-17-65']
see, i am so not ready to be a father.:::['1-17-66']
hey, you're gonna be fine.:::['1-17-67']
you're one of the most caring, responsible men in north america.:::['1-17-68']

you take your time.:::['1-17-77']
there it is.:::['1-17-78', '7-9-284', '4-14-31']
what can i do? i don't want to screw it up with ursula.:::['1-17-80']
and your friend phoebe?:::['1-17-81']
if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. wouldn't you guys?:::['1-17-82']
man, if you tried that on my birthday......you'd be staring at the business end of a hissy fit.:::['1-17-83']
you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference.:::['1-17-84']
okay, uh...:::['1-17-85', '7-16-155', '10-10-120', '2-6-267', '3-14-39']

young to be a doctor.:::['1-17-94']
oh, good, rach. - thank you.:::['1-17-95']

uh, you left out the stupid part.:::['1-17-98']
it's not stupid.:::['1-17-99']
the very cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and i said yes.:::['1-17-100']
i think it's totally insane. i mean, they work for the hospital.:::['1-17-101']
it's like returning to the scene of the crime.:::['1-17-102']
i say we blow off the dates. - what? monica, they are cute.:::['1-17-103']

where's joey?:::['1-17-126', '1-3-261']
did you see betty?:::['1-17-127']
i tell you, i wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried-tomato business.:::['1-17-128']
five years ago, if somebody'd said to me, "here's a tomato that looks like a prune"......i'd have said, "get out of my office.":::['1-17-129']
dad, before i was born, did you freak out at all?:::['1-17-130']
i'm not freaking out. i'm just saying......if someone had come to me with the idea...:::['1-17-131']
dad, dad, dad. i'm talking about the whole, uh, baby thing.:::['1-17-132']
did you, uh, ever get this sort of......panicky, "oh, my god, i'm gonna be a father" kind of a thing?:::['1-17-133']
your mother really did the work. i was busy with the business.:::['1-17-135']
i wasn't around that much.:::['1-17-136']
is that what this is about?:::['1-17-137']
no, no, dad. i was just wondering.:::['1-17-138']
there's time to make up for that. we can do stuff together.:::['1-17-139']
you always wanted to go to colonial williamsburg. how about we do that?:::['1-17-140']
thanks, dad. really, heh.:::['1-17-141']
you know, i just, i just...:::['1-17-142']
i just needed to know, um......when did you start to feel like a father?:::['1-17-143']
oh. well, i guess it must have been the day after you were born.:::['1-17-144']
we were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep......and they brought you in and gave you to me.:::['1-17-145']
you were this ugly little red thing.:::['1-17-146']
and all of a sudden, you grabbed my finger with your whole fist......and you squeezed it......so tight.:::['1-17-147']
and that's when i knew.:::['1-17-148']
so you don't want to go to williamsburg?:::['1-17-149']
we can go to williamsburg.:::['1-17-150']
eat your fish.:::['1-17-151']
monica: rachel, the cute doctors are here.:::['1-17-152']

monica, would you stop being such a wuss?:::['1-17-168']

you have to admit, when we go out with women we meet at the hospital...:::['1-17-172']
would you relax? take a look around.:::['1-17-173']
there are no pagan altars.:::['1-17-174']
no piles of bones in the corners.:::['1-17-175']
they're fine. go like this::::['1-17-176']
i said we are not going to do it, okay? sometimes you can be such a big baby.:::['1-17-177']
i am not a baby. - be serious.:::['1-17-178']
you get uptight... - you act like a princess.:::['1-17-179']
you know what? you know what? - what? what?:::['1-17-180']
every day you are becoming more and more like your mother.:::['1-17-181']
excuse me. hello, here we go.:::['1-17-182']
this is a great place. how long have you lived here?:::['1-17-183']

yeah, i know it's pretty selfish, but, heh......hey, that's me.:::['1-17-188']
why don't you try the hummus? rachel: ahem.:::['1-17-189']

uh, i am a, uh, chef at a restaurant uptown.:::['1-17-191']

well, this hummus is great.:::['1-17-194']
god bless the chickpea.:::['1-17-195']

i was in this room with all the presents......and i was looking at this gravy boat.:::['1-1-66']
this really gorgeous limoges gravy boat.:::['1-1-67']
when all of a sudden... sweet 'n low?:::['1-1-68']
i realized......i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry.:::['1-1-69']
then i got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me::::['1-1-70']
how much barry looks like mr. potato head.:::['1-1-71']
you know, i mean, i always knew he looked familiar, but...:::['1-1-72']
anyway, i just had to get out of there, and i started wondering::::['1-1-73']
"why am i doing this?" and "who am i doing this for?":::['1-1-74']
anyway, i just didn't know where to go, and i know you and i have drifted apart......but you're the only person i know in the city.:::['1-1-75']
who wasn't invited to the wedding.:::['1-1-76']
oh, i was kind of hoping that wouldn't be an issue.:::['1-1-77']
i'm guessing he bought her the big pipe organ......and she's really not happy about it.:::['1-1-78']
daddy, i just... i can't marry him.:::['1-1-79']
i just don't love him.:::['1-1-81']
well, it matters to me.:::['1-1-82']
chandler: she should not be wearing those pants.:::['1-1-83']
i say push her down the stairs.:::['1-1-84']
all: push her down the stairs! push her down the stairs!:::['1-1-85']
come on, daddy, listen to me!:::['1-1-86', '10-10-171']

okay. just breathe, that's it.:::['1-1-101']

yes, and we're very excited about it.:::['1-1-137']
actually, thanks, but i'm just gonna hang out here tonight.:::['1-1-138']
it's been a long day. - oh, sure. okay. sure.:::['1-1-139']
hey, pheebs, you wanna help?:::['1-1-140']
oh, i wish i could, but i don't want to.:::['1-1-141']
i'm supposed to attach a bracket-y thing to the side things......using a bunch of these little worm guys.:::['1-1-142']

this was carol's favorite beer.:::['1-1-147']
she always drank it out of the can. i should have known.:::['1-1-148']
hey. ross, let me ask you a question.:::['1-1-149']

what did you get?:::['1-1-151']
you guys.:::['1-1-152', '9-10-96', '2-9-339', '4-7-176']
oh, god. oh, my god. - you got screwed.:::['1-1-153']
oh, my god. - i know, i know. i'm such an idiot.:::['1-1-154']
i should've caught on when she went to the dentist four and five times a week.:::['1-1-155']
i mean, how clean can teeth get?:::['1-1-156']
my brother's going through that. he's such a mess.:::['1-1-157']
how did you get through it?:::['1-1-158']
he might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers.:::['1-1-159']
say her... - leg?:::['1-1-160']
heh. that's one way of going through it, yeah.:::['1-1-161']
me, i went for the watch.:::['1-1-162']
you actually broke her watch? - mm.:::['1-1-163']
barry, i'm sorry. i am so sorry.:::['1-1-164']
you probably think it's about making love with your socks on, but it isn't.:::['1-1-165']
it isn't, it's about me. and i...:::['1-1-166']
hi. machine cut me off again. anyway...:::['1-1-167']
you know what's scary? what if there's only one woman for everybody?:::['1-1-168']
i mean, what if you get one woman, and that's it?:::['1-1-169']
unfortunately, in my case, there was only one woman for her.:::['1-1-170']
what are you talking about? one woman.:::['1-1-171']
that's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you.:::['1-1-172']
let me tell you something, ross. there's lots of flavors out there.:::['1-1-173']
there's rocky road and cookie dough and bing cherry vanilla.:::['1-1-174']
you can get them with jimmies or nuts or whipped cream.:::['1-1-175']
this is the best thing that ever happened to you.:::['1-1-176']
you got married. you were like, what, 8?:::['1-1-177']
welcome back to the world. grab a spoon.:::['1-1-178']
i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny.:::['1-1-179']
then stay out of my freezer.:::['1-1-180']
ever since she walked out on me, i...:::['1-1-181']
you wanna spell it out with noodles?:::['1-1-183']
no, it's more of a fifth date kind of revelation.:::['1-1-184']
oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?:::['1-1-185']
isn't there?:::['1-1-186']
yeah, yeah. i think there is.:::['1-1-187']
what were you gonna say?:::['1-1-188', '8-3-19']
well... er, uh...:::['1-1-189']
ever since she left me, um......i haven't been able to perform......sexually.:::['1-1-190']
oh, god! oh, god! i am so...:::['1-1-191']
i'm so sorry. - it's okay.:::['1-1-192']
being spit on is probably not what you need right now.:::['1-1-193']
how long?:::['1-1-195', '3-9-111']
two years.:::['1-1-196']
wow!:::['1-1-197', '1-5-228', '8-12-133', '7-20-310', '7-10-286', '7-10-290', '3-8-296', '3-2-15', '3-2-348', '3-2-350', '3-3-291']
i'm glad you smashed her watch.:::['1-1-198']
so you still think you might want that fifth date?:::['1-1-199']
i, joanie, take you, charles, as my lawful husband.:::['1-1-202']
minister: do you take joanie...? - oh! see.:::['1-1-203']
but joanie loved chachi. that's the difference.:::['1-1-204']
"grab a spoon.":::['1-1-205']
do you know long it's been since i grabbed a spoon?:::['1-1-206']
do the words, "billy, don't be a hero," mean anything to you?:::['1-1-207']
you know, here's the thing. even if i could get it together enough......to ask a woman out......who am i gonna ask?:::['1-1-208']
isn't this amazing?:::['1-1-209']

of course it was a line.:::['1-1-259']
why? why would anybody do something like that?:::['1-1-260']
we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than::::['1-1-261']
"to get you into bed.":::['1-1-262']
is it me?:::['1-1-263']
is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs......and men with severe emotional problems can hear?:::['1-1-264']
all right, come here. give me your feet.:::['1-1-265']
i just thought he was nice, you know?:::['1-1-266']

give her a break. it's hard being on your own for the first time.:::['1-1-282']
thank you. - you're welcome.:::['1-1-283', '2-1-324']

my mom had killed herself and my stepdad was back in prison.:::['1-1-285']
and i got here, and i didn't know anybody.:::['1-1-286']
i ended up living with this albino guy who was cleaning windshields......outside port authority. and then he killed himself.:::['1-1-287']
and then i found aromatherapy. so believe me, i know exactly how you feel.:::['1-1-288']
the word you're looking for is::::['1-1-289']

i figured you thought i was monica's geeky older brother.:::['1-1-315']
i did. - oh.:::['1-1-316']
listen, do you think...:::['1-1-317']
and try not to let my vulnerability become any kind of a factor here.:::['1-1-318']
do you think it would be okay if i ask you out sometime, maybe?:::['1-1-319']
okay, maybe i will.:::['1-1-323']

i think we have an answer.:::['1-16-174']
what's she doing here?:::['1-16-175', '8-15-173']
this could be god's way of telling us to eat at home.:::['1-16-176']
think she got fired at riff's? - no, we were there last night.:::['1-16-177']
she kept bringing swordfish. are you gonna go?:::['1-16-178']

she's different. there's, uh, something about her...:::['1-16-222']
that you like. we get it. you like her. great.:::['1-16-223']
hey, phoebe, i asked you, and you said it was okay.:::['1-16-224']

she's still here.:::['1-16-234']
yes. yes, she is.:::['1-16-235']
didn't i memo you on this?:::['1-16-236']
see, after i let her go, uh, i got a call from her psychiatrist, dr. flanen......dr. flanan, dr. flan.:::['1-16-237']
and, uh, he informed me that she took the news rather badly.:::['1-16-238']
in fact, he, uh, mentioned the word "frenzy.":::['1-16-239']
you're kidding. she seems so...:::['1-16-240']
oh, no, no. nina? she's::::['1-16-241']
in fact, if you asked her now......she'd have no recollection of being fired at all.:::['1-16-242']
that's unbelievable.:::['1-16-243']
and yet believable.:::['1-16-244']
so i decided not to fire her again......until i'm sure she will be of no threat to herself or others.:::['1-16-245']
i see. hmm. you never really know what's going on inside a person's head.:::['1-16-246']
well, i guess that's why they call it psychology, sir.:::['1-16-247']
for this, after all, is the miracle of birth.:::['1-16-248']
teacher: lights, please.:::['1-16-249']

i just never realized the baby was having me.:::['1-16-271']
oh, you're gonna be great.:::['1-16-272']

you meant sex, right?:::['1-16-285']
do you have a sec? - uh, sure, nina. what's up?:::['1-16-286']
i don't know. for the past couple days, people have been avoiding me......and giving me these really strange looks.:::['1-16-287']
oh, well, uh, maybe that's because......they're, uh, jealous of us.:::['1-16-288']
but that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.:::['1-16-290']
uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise.:::['1-16-291']
i am? - sure. why not?:::['1-16-292']
oh, my god. you're amazing.:::['1-16-293']

well, i ended up telling her everything. - ooh. how'd she take it?:::['1-16-298']
pretty well. except for the stapler thing.:::['1-16-299']
little tip. if you're ever in a similar situation......never, ever leave your hand on the desk.:::['1-16-300']
okay, i think i get how to do this.:::['1-16-301']
can we turn this off? can we make them go away?:::['1-16-302']
because i can't watch.:::['1-16-303']
okay, pheebs, they're gone. - okay.:::['1-16-304']
are you all right? - yeah.:::['1-16-305']
it's just, you know, this whole stupid ursula thing.:::['1-16-306']
okay, pheebs, can i ask?:::['1-16-307']
um, yeah.:::['1-16-309', '7-5-285', '10-5-118']
i mean, i'm not saying she's evil or anything.:::['1-16-310']
she's just, you know, always breaking my stuff.:::['1-16-311']
when i was 8, i wouldn't let her have my judy jetson thermos......so she threw it under the bus.:::['1-16-312']
and then there's randy brown......who was like...:::['1-16-313']
have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?:::['1-16-314']
well, but that's what he was for me.:::['1-16-316']
and she, you know, kind of stole him away......and then broke his heart.:::['1-16-317']
and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore.:::['1-16-318']
he didn't want to be around anything that looked like either one of us.:::['1-16-319']
i mean, i know joey's not my boyfriend or my thermos......or anything, but...:::['1-16-321']
you won't lose him. - you gotta talk to joey.:::['1-16-322']
come on. he doesn't know this stuff. if he knew how you felt...:::['1-16-324']
he's falling in love with her.:::['1-16-325']
oh, please. they've been going out a week.:::['1-16-326']
they haven't even slept together yet. i mean, that's not serious.:::['1-16-327']
oh. okay. oh.:::['1-16-329']
yeah, um, may we help you?:::['1-16-331']
rachel, what are you doing? it's freezing. would you come inside?:::['1-16-332']
you wanted me to take them down......so i'm taking them down, okay?:::['1-16-334']
rachel!:::['1-16-335', '9-3-89', '2-2-236', '4-21-116', '3-6-118', '3-6-321', '3-16-57']
mr. heckles?:::['1-16-337']
mr. heckles, could you help me, please?:::['1-16-338']
see, this is just the kind of thing i was talking about.:::['1-16-339']
i'm telling you, ross, she wants you.:::['1-14-0']
she barely knows me. we just live in the same building.:::['1-14-1']
any contact? - she lent me an egg once.:::['1-14-2']
you're in.:::['1-14-3']
hey, ross. - hey.:::['1-14-5']
come on, ross. you gotta get back in the game here.:::['1-14-6']
the rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife's a lesbian, you...:::['1-14-7']
i don't think we need a third.:::['1-14-8']
excuse me. could we get an egg over here, still in the shell?:::['1-14-9']
an egg?:::['1-14-10']
yeah. go up to her and say, "here's your egg back. i'm returning your egg.":::['1-14-11']
i think it's winning.:::['1-14-12']
i think it's insane. - she'll love it.:::['1-14-13']
thank you. - thank you. here.:::['1-14-14']
go with the egg, my friend.:::['1-14-15']
joey & chandler: go, go, go.:::['1-14-16']
think it'll work? - it's suicide. the man's got an egg.:::['1-14-17']
friends s01e14: the one with the candy hearts:::['1-14-18']
monica: you cannot do this. rachel: what? do what?:::['1-14-19']
roger wants to take her out.:::['1-14-20']
no. pheebs. don't you remember why you dumped the guy?:::['1-14-21']
because he was creepy.:::['1-14-22']
and mean. and a little frightening.:::['1-14-23']
still, it's nice to have a date on valentine's day.:::['1-14-24']
you can go out with a creep any night of the year.:::['1-14-26']
i know i do.:::['1-14-27', '3-1-125']
what are you doing tomorrow night?:::['1-14-29']
actually, tomorrow night depends on how tonight goes.:::['1-14-30']
oh. uh, listen, about tonight... - no, no, don't you dare bail on me.:::['1-14-31']
she's only going out with me because i'm bringing a friend for her friend.:::['1-14-32']
but her friend sounds like such a...:::['1-14-33']
pathetic mess. i know, but...:::['1-14-34']
come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable.:::['1-14-35']
i'm thinking::::['1-14-36']
you haven't been out with a woman since janice. you're doing this.:::['1-14-38']
she said yes. - ahem.:::['1-14-40']
yes! way to go, man.:::['1-14-41']
chandler: still got the egg, huh? - yeah.:::['1-14-42']
how do i look? - oh, um......i don't care.:::['1-14-43']
now, remember, no trading.:::['1-14-45']
you get the pretty one. i get the mess.:::['1-14-46']
hi, joey. - hey.:::['1-14-47']
well, well.:::['1-14-48']
look what you brought.:::['1-14-49']
very nice.:::['1-14-50', '4-11-36']
joey, i'm gonna go wash the cab smell off of my hands.:::['1-14-53']
oh......my......god.:::['1-14-56', '2-24-332']
hey, it's janice.:::['1-14-57']
okay, i'm making a break for it. i'm going out the window.:::['1-14-58']
no, don't, please. i've been waiting for forever to go out with lorraine.:::['1-14-59']
just calm down. - calm down? calm down?:::['1-14-60']
you set me up with a woman i've dumped twice in the last five months.:::['1-14-61']
can you stop yelling? you're making me nervous......and i can't go when i'm nervous.:::['1-14-63']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. you're right.:::['1-14-64']
come on! do it, do it, do it! come on!:::['1-14-65']
okay, roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to pete carney.:::['1-14-66']
which one was he? - pete the weeper?:::['1-14-67']
remember the guy that used to cry every time we had sex?:::['1-14-68']
"oh, was it good for you?":::['1-14-69']
well, i'd take a little crying any day over howard, the "i win" guy.:::['1-14-70']
"i win. i win.":::['1-14-71']
i went out with him for two months. i didn't get to win once.:::['1-14-72']
how do we end up with these jerks? we're good people.:::['1-14-73']
i don't know. i think we're like some kind of magnets.:::['1-14-74']
i know i am. that's why i can't wear a digital watch.:::['1-14-75']
there's more beer, right?:::['1-14-76']
oh. you know my friend abby who shaves her head?:::['1-14-77']
she says to break the bad-boyfriend cycle......you can do a cleansing ritual.:::['1-14-78']
pheebs, this woman is voluntarily bald.:::['1-14-79']
so we can do it tomorrow night, you guys.:::['1-14-81']
it's valentine's day. it's perfect.:::['1-14-82']
okay, well, what kind of ritual?:::['1-14-83']
okay, we can, um, burn the stuff they gave us.:::['1-14-84']
or?:::['1-14-85', '10-6-335']
or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.:::['1-14-86']
burning's good. - burning's good.:::['1-14-87']
rachel: i've got stuff to burn.:::['1-14-88']
you know......ever since i was little, i've been able to pick up quarters with my toes.:::['1-14-89']
yeah? good for you.:::['1-14-90']
uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?:::['1-14-91']
by the way, chandler, i cut you out of all of my pictures.:::['1-14-92']
so if you want, i have a bag with just your heads.:::['1-14-93']
are you sure? because you could make little puppets out of them.:::['1-14-95']
and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.:::['1-14-96']
we can't do that.:::['1-14-97']
what? what can't you do?:::['1-14-98']
uh, can i talk to you for a second? over there?:::['1-14-99']
uh, we might be leaving now.:::['1-14-100']
tell me it's you and me "we.":::['1-14-101']
she said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.:::['1-14-102']
i'm not even sure what slathering is.:::['1-14-103']
but i definitely want to be a part of it.:::['1-14-104']
okay, you cannot do this to me.:::['1-14-105']
you're right. i'm sorry. you're right.:::['1-14-106']
uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go, please?:::['1-14-107']
here's my credit card. dinner's on me. i'm sorry, chandler.:::['1-14-109']
i hope she throws up on you.:::['1-14-110']
so... - just us.:::['1-14-112']
ugh, what a crappy night.:::['1-14-113']
although i have enjoyed the fact that your shirt's been sticking out......of your zipper since you came back from the bathroom.:::['1-14-114']
so do we have the best friends, or what?:::['1-14-117']
joey's not a friend. he's......a stupid man who left us his credit card.:::['1-14-118']
another drink? some dessert? a big-screen tv?:::['1-14-119']
i will go for that drink.:::['1-14-120']
you got it. good woman.:::['1-14-121']
a bottle of your most overpriced champagne.:::['1-14-122']
each. - that's right. each.:::['1-14-123']
oh. and a, uh, rob roy.:::['1-14-124']
i've always wanted to know.:::['1-14-125']
happy valentine's day.:::['1-14-126']
oh, i miss you already.:::['1-14-127']
can you believe this happened?:::['1-14-128']
and yet it did.:::['1-14-130']
goodbye, janice. - kiss me.:::['1-14-131']
oh, chandler. sorry.:::['1-14-132', '1-14-133']
hey, janice. - hi, monica.:::['1-14-134']
okay. well, this was very special.:::['1-14-135']
rach, come see who's out here.:::['1-14-136']
what's going on...? oh, my god.:::['1-14-137']
janice. hi.:::['1-14-138']

i'll be right back.:::['1-14-140', '1-5-296', '8-1-7', '4-5-245']
oh. joey. look who it is.:::['1-14-141']
oh, good. joey's home now.:::['1-14-143']
this is so much fun.:::['1-14-144']
this is like a reunion in the hall.:::['1-14-145']
hi, ross. there's someone i want you to say hi to.:::['1-14-146']
he just happened to call.:::['1-14-147']
hello, ross. yes, that's right. it's me. how did you know?:::['1-14-148']
i'm just saying if dogs do experience jet lag, then......because of the whole seven-dog- years-to-one-human-year thing......that when a dog flies from new york to los angeles......he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses, like, a week and a half.:::['1-14-149']
that's funny. - yeah.:::['1-14-150']
who are they?:::['1-14-152']
the, uh, blond is my ex-wife.:::['1-14-153']
and the woman touching her is her......close personal friend.:::['1-14-154']
you mean they're lovers?:::['1-14-155']
if you want to put a label on it.:::['1-14-156']
wow. heh.:::['1-14-157']
anything else i should know? - nope. that's it.:::['1-14-158']
oh, and she's pregnant with my baby.:::['1-14-159']
i always forget that part.:::['1-14-160']
okay. so now we need, um, sage branches and the sacramental wine.:::['1-14-162']
all i had is oregano and a fresca.:::['1-14-163']
um, that's okay.:::['1-14-164']
rachel: ooh. - okay.:::['1-14-165']
all right. now we need the semen of a righteous man.:::['1-14-166']
huh. okay, pheebs, if we had that......we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.:::['1-14-167']
can we start throwing things in?:::['1-14-168']
um, yeah, okay.:::['1-14-169']
oh. okay. um...:::['1-14-170']
okay. barry's letters.:::['1-14-171']
adam ritter's boxer shorts.:::['1-14-172']
and i have the receipt from my dinner with::::['1-14-173']
a picture of scotty jared, naked. - let me see.:::['1-14-174']
he's wearing a sweater.:::['1-14-175']
no.  rachel & phoebe: ew!:::['1-14-176']
okay, and here we have the last of paolo's grappa.:::['1-14-177']
wait. isn't it almost pure...?:::['1-14-178']
how can i dump this woman on valentine's day?:::['1-14-179']
i don't know. you dumped her on new year's.:::['1-14-180']
oh, man. in my next life i'm coming back as a toilet brush.:::['1-14-181']
hello, funny valentine.:::['1-14-182']
hi, just janice.:::['1-14-183']
hello, joey, our little matchmaker.:::['1-14-184']
i could just kiss you all over, and i'm gonna.:::['1-14-185']
oh. okay, heh. ha, ha, okay.:::['1-14-186']
if you don't do it, i will.:::['1-14-187']
so, um, what do you do for a living?:::['1-14-188']
well, um for the past few years...:::['1-14-189']
oh, no. you said they could shoot the spot without you.:::['1-14-190']
susan: i thought they could.:::['1-14-191']
working with children, which is really fulfilling.:::['1-14-192']
i'll try to get back as soon as i can. i'm sorry.:::['1-14-193']
kristen: so i'm spending most of my time teaching science, heh......which is funny because that wasn't even my major.:::['1-14-194']
now, that is funny.:::['1-14-195']
hey, do you think...?:::['1-14-196']
would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us?:::['1-14-197']
because she's alone now.:::['1-14-198']
and pregnant. and sad.:::['1-14-199']
i guess. - are you sure?:::['1-14-200']
thanks. carol.:::['1-14-201']

um... oh, uh, carol teaches sixth grade.:::['1-14-211']
and, uh, kristen...:::['1-14-212']
kristen does something......that, funnily enough......wasn't even her major.:::['1-14-213']
fireman 1: what do we got there?:::['1-14-214']
a piece of silk boxer shorts......some greeting cards......what looks like a half-charred picture of...:::['1-14-215']
wow, that guy's hairier than the chief.:::['1-14-216']
you know, it's a really funny story how this happened.:::['1-14-217']
it's all right. don't explain.:::['1-14-218']
it's not the first boyfriend bonfire we've seen get out of control.:::['1-14-219']
you're our third call tonight. - really?:::['1-14-220']

oh, little candy hearts.:::['1-14-224']
"chan and jan forever.":::['1-14-225']

janice.:::['1-14-228', '1-5-238', '8-24-31', '4-15-124']
hey, janice.:::['1-14-229']
look, there's no way for me to tell you this.:::['1-14-230']
at least, there's no new way for me to tell you this.:::['1-14-231']
i just don't think things are gonna work out.:::['1-14-232']
that's fine.:::['1-14-233', '2-3-304', '2-4-247', '2-20-317', '3-24-104', '3-20-269']
it is? - mm-hm.:::['1-14-234']
because i know that this isn't the end.:::['1-14-235']
oh, no. you see, actually, it is.:::['1-14-236']
no, it isn't. because you won't let that happen.:::['1-14-237']
don't you know it yet?:::['1-14-238']
you love me, chandler bing.:::['1-14-239']
oh, no, i don't.:::['1-14-240']
then why do you think we keep ending up together?:::['1-14-241']
new year's, who invited who?:::['1-14-242']
valentine's, who asked who into whose bed?:::['1-14-243']
i did, but... - you seek me out.:::['1-14-244']
something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn.:::['1-14-245']
janice. janice.:::['1-14-246']
you want me. you need me.:::['1-14-247']
you can't live without me.:::['1-14-248']
and you know it.:::['1-14-249']
you just don't know you know it.:::['1-14-250']
call me.:::['1-14-252', '5-1-224']
it's not true. i never called your mother a wolverine.:::['1-14-253']
you did so. i swear. i swear to...:::['1-14-254']
how long has she been in the bathroom?:::['1-14-255']
uh, i don't think she's in the bathroom. her coat is gone.:::['1-14-256']
well, maybe it's cold in there.:::['1-14-257']
maybe i screwed up the first date i had in nine years.:::['1-14-258']
that could be it. - oh, god.:::['1-14-259']
you know, this is still pretty hot.:::['1-14-260']
mushroom.:::['1-14-261']
smile.:::['1-14-262']
they won't all be like this. some might even stay through dinner.:::['1-14-263']
i'm sorry. that's not funny. - no, it's just...:::['1-14-264']
well, you know the whole getting-on-with-your-life thing?:::['1-14-265']
well, do i have to?:::['1-14-266']
i mean, well, i'm sitting here with this cute woman......and she's perfectly nice, you know?:::['1-14-267']
but there's...:::['1-14-268']
and, uh, then i'm here talking to you, and it's easy and it's fun.:::['1-14-270']
and i don't have to...:::['1-14-271']
i know. - you know?:::['1-14-272']
here's a wacky thought. um, ahem.:::['1-14-273']
let's say you and i give it another shot. - ross.:::['1-14-274']
no, no, i know what you're gonna say. you're a lesbian.:::['1-14-275']
but what do you say we just put that aside for now, you know?:::['1-14-276']
let's just stick a pin in it, okay?:::['1-14-277']
because we're great together, you know?:::['1-14-278']
you can't deny it.:::['1-14-279']
and besides, you're carrying my baby.:::['1-14-280']
i mean, how perfect is that? - ross...:::['1-14-281']
you keep saying that, but there's something right here.:::['1-14-282']
i love you too.:::['1-14-284', '9-3-307', '9-6-386', '10-12-414', '2-24-83', '5-16-21', '3-4-335']
but... - no "but." no "but.":::['1-14-285']
you know that thing we put over here with the pin in it?:::['1-14-286']
it's time to take the pin out.:::['1-14-287']
you'll find someone. i know you will. the right woman is waiting for you.:::['1-14-289']
it's easy for you to say. you found one already.:::['1-14-290']
all you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.:::['1-14-291']
not her.:::['1-14-292', '10-11-302', '4-10-139']
we get off around midnight. why don't we pick you up then?:::['1-14-293']
rachel: okay. monica: great.:::['1-14-294']
so, um, will you bring the truck?:::['1-14-295']
i'll even let you ring the bell. - wohoo!:::['1-14-296']
fireman 1: we'll see you later. fireman 2: bye. see you later.:::['1-14-297']
thanks. see you.:::['1-14-298']
see, there you go.:::['1-14-300']
the cleansing worked. monica: you're right.:::['1-14-301']
they're nice guys.:::['1-14-302']
they're firemen guys.:::['1-14-303']
fireman 1: you tell them you're married? fireman 2: no way.:::['1-14-304']
my girlfriend doesn't know. i'm not gonna tell them.:::['1-14-305']
hi, guys. joey: hey, phoebe.:::['1-3-0']
hey, oh, how did it go?:::['1-3-1']
um, not so good.:::['1-3-2']
he walked me to the subway and said, "we should do this again.":::['1-3-3']
ouch. - what? he said, "we should do it again.":::['1-3-4']
that's good, right?:::['1-3-5']
uh, no. loosely translated, "we should do this again," means::::['1-3-6']
"you will never see me naked.":::['1-3-7']
since when?:::['1-3-8']
since always. it's, like, dating language.:::['1-3-9']
you know, like, "it's not you," means, "it is you.":::['1-3-10']
"you're such a nice guy," means::::['1-3-11']
"i'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics......and complaining about them to you.":::['1-3-12']
or, you know, um, "i think we should see other people," means::::['1-3-13']
"ha, ha, i already am.":::['1-3-14']
and everybody knows this?:::['1-3-15']
oh, yeah. cushions the blow.:::['1-3-16']
like when you're a kid and your parents put your dog to sleep......and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.:::['1-3-17']
that's funny. no, because, uh, our parents actually did......uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.:::['1-3-18']
uh, ross?:::['1-3-19', '1-7-73', '5-6-223']
ha, ha. hello. the milner's farm in connecticut?:::['1-3-20']
the milners, they had this unbelievable farm.:::['1-3-21']
they had horses and rabbits that he could chase.:::['1-3-22']
and it was...:::['1-3-23']
oh, my god. chi-chi.:::['1-3-24']
friends s01e03: the one with the thumb:::['1-3-25']
"so how does it feel knowing you're about to die?":::['1-3-26']
warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.:::['1-3-27']
but you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.:::['1-3-28']
hey, that was really good. - yeah?:::['1-3-29']
yeah. - thanks. let's keep going.:::['1-3-30']
okay. "so, what do you want from me, dimon? huh?":::['1-3-31']
i just wanna go back to my cell, because in my cell, i can smoke.:::['1-3-32']
"smoke away.":::['1-3-33']
heh.:::['1-3-34', '9-18-279', '2-18-72']
i think this is probably why dimon smokes in his cell alone.:::['1-3-35']
what? - relax your hand.:::['1-3-36']
let your wrist go.:::['1-3-37']
not so much.  - whoa.:::['1-3-38']
all right. now try taking a puff.:::['1-3-40']
okay, no, give it to me. - no, no, no. i'm not giving you a cigarette.:::['1-3-42']
no, it's fine. it's fine. look, do you want to get this part or not? here.:::['1-3-43']
all right. now, don't think of it as a cigarette.:::['1-3-44']
think of it as the thing that has been missing from your hand.:::['1-3-45']
when you're holding it, you feel right.:::['1-3-46']
you feel complete. - you miss it?:::['1-3-47']
no, not so much.:::['1-3-48']
all right. now we smoke.:::['1-3-49']
they say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb......to the tip of his index finger.:::['1-3-52']
can i use either thumb?:::['1-3-54']
all right. don't tell me, don't tell me.:::['1-3-55']
decaf cappuccino for joey.:::['1-3-56']
coffee, black.:::['1-3-57']
latte.:::['1-3-58']
and an iced tea.:::['1-3-59']
i'm getting pretty good at this. - excellent. that's very good.:::['1-3-60']
good for me.:::['1-3-61']
you okay, phoebe? - yeah, no, it's not even worth...:::['1-3-62']
it's my bank.:::['1-3-63']
what did they do to you?:::['1-3-64']
it's nothing, it's just... okay.:::['1-3-65']
i'm going through my mail, and i open up their monthly "statement.":::['1-3-66']
easy.:::['1-3-67', '3-21-328']
and there's 500 extra dollars in my account.:::['1-3-68']
oh, satan's minions at work again.:::['1-3-69']
yes, because now i have to go down there and deal with them...:::['1-3-70']
what are you talking about? keep it. - it's not mine.:::['1-3-71']
i didn't earn it. if i kept it, it would be like stealing.:::['1-3-72']
yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping.:::['1-3-73']
let's say i bought a really great pair of shoes.:::['1-3-75']
do you know what i'd hear with every step i took?:::['1-3-76']
"not mine. not mine. not mine.":::['1-3-77']
and even if i was happy, okay, and skipping......i'd hear, "not mine. not mine.":::['1-3-78']
we're with you. we got it.:::['1-3-79']
okay, i'd never be able to enjoy it. it'd be like this giant karmic debt.:::['1-3-80']
chandler, what are you doing? hey.:::['1-3-81']
oh, gross.:::['1-3-83']
what is this? - i'm smoking. i'm smoking. i'm smoking.:::['1-3-84']
i can't believe you. you've been so good for three years.:::['1-3-85']
and this is my reward.:::['1-3-86']
hold on a second. just think about what you went through the last time you quit.:::['1-3-87']
okay, so this time i won't quit.:::['1-3-88']
put it out. - all right. i'm putting it out.:::['1-3-89']
i can't drink this now.:::['1-3-91']
all right, i'm gonna go change. i've got a date.:::['1-3-92']
is this alan again? how's it going?:::['1-3-93']
it's going pretty good, you know? it's nice and we're having fun.:::['1-3-94']
so when do we get to meet the guy? ross: yeah.:::['1-3-95']
let's see, today's monday...:::['1-3-96']
never. - come on.:::['1-3-97']
no, not after what happened with steve. - what are you talking about?:::['1-3-98']
we love steve. steve was sexy.:::['1-3-99']
look, i don't know how i feel about him yet. give me a chance to figure it out.:::['1-3-101']
well, then can we meet him?:::['1-3-102']
why should i let them meet him?:::['1-3-105']
i bring a guy home and within five minutes they're all over him.:::['1-3-106']
i mean, they're like coyotes picking off the weak members of the herd.:::['1-3-107']
listen, as someone who's seen more than her share of bad beef......i'll tell you, that is not such a terrible thing.:::['1-3-108']
come on, they're your friends. they're looking out after you.:::['1-3-109']
i know, i know. i wish that once i'd bring a guy home they actually liked.:::['1-3-110']
well, you do realize that the odds of that happening are a little slimmer......if they never get to meet the guy.:::['1-3-111']
let it go, ross.:::['1-3-112']
yeah? well, you didn't know chi-chi.:::['1-3-113']
monica: do you all promise?:::['1-3-114']
yeah, we promise. we'll be good. joey: we promise.:::['1-3-115']
chandler, do you promise to be good?:::['1-3-116']
you can come in, but your filter tip little buddy has to stay outside.:::['1-3-117']
ross: hey, pheebs.:::['1-3-118']
"dear ms. buffay: thank you for calling attention to our error.:::['1-3-119']
we have credited your account $500. we're sorry for the inconvenience......and hope you'll accept this football phone......as our free gift." do you believe this?:::['1-3-120']
now i have $1000 and a football phone.:::['1-3-121']
what bank is this?:::['1-3-122']
okay, it's him.:::['1-3-123']
who is it? alan: alan.:::['1-3-124']
chandler. he's here.:::['1-3-125']
okay, please be good. please?:::['1-3-126']
i mean, remember how much you like me.:::['1-3-127']
hi. alan, this is everybody. everybody, this is alan.:::['1-3-128']
hi. group: hey.:::['1-3-129']
i've heard so much about all you guys.:::['1-3-130']
monica: thanks, i'll call you tomorrow.:::['1-3-131']
okay, let's let the alan-bashing begin.:::['1-3-133']
who's gonna take the first shot?:::['1-3-134']
hmm?:::['1-3-135']
i'll go.:::['1-3-137', '7-7-324', '3-7-44']
let's start with the way he kept picking at...:::['1-3-138']
you know, i'm sorry, i can't do this.:::['1-3-139']
can't do it. we loved him.:::['1-3-140']
group: we loved him. - wait a minute.:::['1-3-141']
we're talking about someone that i'm going out with?:::['1-3-142']
group: yes. - and did you notice?:::['1-3-143']
know what was great? the way his smile was kind of crooked.:::['1-3-145']
yes, yes. like the man in the shoe.:::['1-3-146']
what shoe?:::['1-3-147']
from the nursery rhyme.:::['1-3-148']
"there was a crooked man who had a crooked smile......who lived in a shoe for a while...":::['1-3-149']
so i think alan......will become the yardstick......against which all future boyfriends will be measured.:::['1-3-150']
what future boyfriends?:::['1-3-151']
no, no. i think this could be, you know, "it.":::['1-3-152']
really? - oh, yeah.:::['1-3-153', '2-4-135']
i'd marry him just for his david hasselhoff impression alone.:::['1-3-154']
you know i'm gonna be doing that at parties, right?:::['1-3-155']
you know what i like most about him? - what?:::['1-3-156']
the way he makes me feel about myself.:::['1-3-157']
all: yeah.:::['1-3-158', '2-17-19', '5-3-311', '4-9-266']
how was the game?:::['1-3-160']
we won! - we won! thank you! yeah.:::['1-3-162']
fantastic. i have one question: how is that possible?:::['1-3-163']
alan. - he was unbelievable.:::['1-3-164']
he was like that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions.:::['1-3-165']
but instead of bugs, it was first base, alan. second base, alan...:::['1-3-166']
i mean, it was like he made us into a team.:::['1-3-167']
yep. we sure showed those hasidic jewelers......a thing or two about softball. - nice.:::['1-3-168']
can i ask you guys a question?:::['1-3-169']
do you ever think that alan is maybe sometimes...:::['1-3-170']
what? - i don't know. a little too alan?:::['1-3-171']
oh, no. that's not possible. you can never be too alan.:::['1-3-172']
yeah, it's his innate alan-ness that we adore.:::['1-3-173']
i, personally, could have a gallon of alan. - oh!:::['1-3-174']
hey, lizzy. - hey, weird girl.:::['1-3-175']
i brought you alphabet soup. - did you pick out the vowels?:::['1-3-176']
yes, but i left in the y's. because, you know, "sometimes y.":::['1-3-177']
um, i also have something else for you.:::['1-3-178']
saltines?:::['1-3-179']
no, but would you like $1000 and a football phone?:::['1-3-180']
oh, my god. there's really money in here. - i know.:::['1-3-183']
weird girl, what are you doing?:::['1-3-184']
oh, i want you to have it. i don't want it.:::['1-3-185']
no, no. i have to give you something.:::['1-3-186']
no, it's fine. you don't...:::['1-3-187']
do you want my tinfoil hat?:::['1-3-188']
no, because you need that. no, it's okay. thanks.:::['1-3-189']
please. let me do something.:::['1-3-190']
okay, all right. i'll tell you what.:::['1-3-191']
you buy me a soda and then we're even. okay?:::['1-3-192']
keep the change.:::['1-3-194']
thanks, lizzy.:::['1-3-195']
sure you don't want a pretzel?:::['1-3-196']
no, i'm fine. thanks. - see you.:::['1-3-197']
a thumb?:::['1-3-199']
group: ew.:::['1-3-200']
i know, i know. i opened it up and there it was......just floating in there, like this tiny little hitchhiker.:::['1-3-201']
maybe it's a contest, you know? like "collect all five.":::['1-3-202']
does, um, anyone wanna see?:::['1-3-203']
no, thanks.:::['1-3-204', '9-18-16', '4-5-242']
oh, hey, don't do that. come on. - cut that out.:::['1-3-205']
it's worse than the thumb.:::['1-3-206']
hey, this is so unfair.:::['1-3-207']
why is it unfair? - so i have a flaw. big deal.:::['1-3-208']
like joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying?:::['1-3-209']
and ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word.:::['1-3-210']
and monica, with that snort when she laughs.:::['1-3-211']
i mean, what the hell is that thing?:::['1-3-212']
i accept all those flaws. why can't you accept me for this?:::['1-3-213']
does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody, or just him?:::['1-3-214']
well......i could live without it.:::['1-3-215']
well, is it, like, a little annoying? or is it like when phoebe chews her hair?:::['1-3-217']
now, don't listen to him, pheebs, all right? i think it's endearing.:::['1-3-218']
oh, you do, do you?:::['1-3-219']
you know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.:::['1-3-220']
indeed there isn't.:::['1-3-221']
i should really get back to work.:::['1-3-222']
yeah, otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.:::['1-3-223']
oh. the hair comes out and the gloves come off.:::['1-3-224']
did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?:::['1-3-225']
okay. well, i'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.:::['1-3-227']
we talking about the coyotes here?:::['1-3-228']
heh. all right. a cow got through.:::['1-3-229']
can you believe it?:::['1-3-230', '1-15-119', '5-8-237', '5-6-16']
it's just, you know what?:::['1-3-231']
i just don't feel the thing.:::['1-3-232']
i mean, they feel the thing. i don't feel the thing.:::['1-3-233']
honey, you should always......feel the thing.:::['1-3-234']
listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, monica, dump him.:::['1-3-235']
i know, it's just gonna be really hard.:::['1-3-236']
yeah, he's a big boy. he'll get over it.:::['1-3-237']
no, he'll be fine. it's the other five i'm worried about.:::['1-3-238']
do you have any respect for your body?:::['1-3-239']
don't you realize what you're doing to yourself?:::['1-3-240']
hey, you know, i've had it with you and your cancer......and your emphysema and your heart disease.:::['1-3-241']
the bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.:::['1-3-242']
ahem. chandler?:::['1-3-243']
it's alan. he wants to speak to you.:::['1-3-244']
really? he does?:::['1-3-245']
hey, buddy. what's up?:::['1-3-246']
oh, she told you about that, huh?:::['1-3-247']
well, yeah. i have one now and then. well, yeah, now.:::['1-3-248']
well, it's not that bad...:::['1-3-249']
well, that's true.:::['1-3-250']
gee, you know, no one's ever put it like that before.:::['1-3-251']
well, okay. thanks.:::['1-3-252']
god, he's good.:::['1-3-253']
if only he were a woman.:::['1-3-254']
chandler: oh, lamb chop.:::['1-3-256']
how old is that sock?:::['1-3-257']
if i had a sock on my hand for 30 years, it'd be talking too.:::['1-3-258']
okay, i think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch.:::['1-3-259']
joey ate my last stick of gum, so i killed him.:::['1-3-262']
do you think that was wrong?:::['1-3-263']
i think he's across the hall. - thanks.:::['1-3-264']
ooh, i'm alive with pleasure now.:::['1-3-266']
hey, pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that pop tart?:::['1-3-267']
does anyone want the rest of this pop tart?:::['1-3-268']
hey, i might.:::['1-3-269']
you know, those stupid soda people gave me $7000 for the thumb.:::['1-3-271']
oh, my god. - seven thousand dollars?:::['1-3-272']
and on my way over here, i stepped in gum.:::['1-3-273']
what is up with the universe?:::['1-3-274']
nothing. i just think it's nice when we're all here together.:::['1-3-276']
it's even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.:::['1-3-277']
uh, joey... - oh.:::['1-3-278']
monica: okay. - oh, come on.:::['1-3-279']
please, guys, we have to talk.:::['1-3-280']
wait, wait. i'm getting a déjà vu.:::['1-3-281']
all right, we have to talk. - there it is.:::['1-3-283']
okay, it's about alan.:::['1-3-284']
there's something you should know.:::['1-3-285', '9-4-237']
oh, man, there's really no easy way to say this. uh...:::['1-3-286']
i've decided to break up with alan.:::['1-3-287']
is there somebody else?:::['1-3-288']
no, no, no. it's just......you know, things change. people change.:::['1-3-289']
we didn't change.:::['1-3-290']
so that's it? it's over?:::['1-3-291']
just like that?:::['1-3-292']
you know, you let your guard down.:::['1-3-293']
you know, you start to really care about someone, and i just...:::['1-3-294']
look, i could go on pretending... - okay.:::['1-3-295']
no. no, that wouldn't be fair to me......it wouldn't be fair to alan, or to you.:::['1-3-296']
yeah, well, who wants fair?:::['1-3-297']
i mean, i just want things back, you know, the way they were.:::['1-3-298']
i'm sorry. - oh, she's sorry. i feel better.:::['1-3-299']
i just can't believe this.:::['1-3-300']
i mean, with the holidays coming up. i wanted him to meet my family.:::['1-3-301']
i'll meet someone else. there'll be other alans.:::['1-3-302']
are you guys gonna be okay? - hey, hey. we'll be fine.:::['1-3-304']
we're just gonna need a little time.:::['1-3-305']
i understand.:::['1-3-306', '8-2-237', '9-22-297', '10-15-270', '10-17-424', '5-16-239']
i'm really sorry. - yeah. i mean, i'm sorry too.:::['1-3-308']
but i gotta tell you, i'm a little relieved.:::['1-3-309']
relieved? - yeah, well......i mean, i had a great time with you.:::['1-3-310']
i just can't stand your friends.:::['1-3-311']
remember when we went to central park and rented boats?:::['1-3-312']
that was fun.:::['1-3-313']
yeah. he could row like a viking.:::['1-3-314']
hi. group: hi.:::['1-3-315', '8-19-0']
so how'd it go?:::['1-3-316']
you know. - did he mention us?:::['1-3-317']
he says he's really gonna miss you guys.:::['1-3-318']
ross: you had a rough day, huh?:::['1-3-319']
oh, you have no idea. ross: come here.:::['1-3-320']
that's it. i'm getting cigarettes. group: no, no, no.:::['1-3-321']
i don't care. i don't care.:::['1-3-322', '3-20-262']
game's over. i'm weak. i've gotta smoke. i've gotta have the smoke.:::['1-3-323']
if you never smoke again, i'll give you $7000.:::['1-3-324']
what you guys don't understand is......for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.:::['1-2-0']
you serious?:::['1-2-2']
everything you need to know is in that first kiss.:::['1-2-4']
absolutely. - yeah, i think, for us......kissing is pretty much like an opening act.:::['1-2-5']
i mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through......before pink floyd comes out.:::['1-2-6']
yeah, and it's not that we don't like the comedian.:::['1-2-7']
it's just that that's not......why we bought the ticket.:::['1-2-8']
see, the problem is, though......after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was......you girls are always looking for the comedian again.:::['1-2-9']
i mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic......basically just trying to stay awake.:::['1-2-10']
yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian.:::['1-2-11']
otherwise, you're gonna find yourself......sitting at home listening to that album alone.:::['1-2-12']
are we still talking about sex?:::['1-2-13']
friends s01e02: the one with the sonogram at the end:::['1-2-14']
ross: no, it's good. it is good.:::['1-2-15']
it's just that, doesn't she seem a little angry?:::['1-2-16']
well, she has issues.:::['1-2-17']
does she?:::['1-2-18']
he's out banging other women over the head with a club......while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet.:::['1-2-19']
marsha, see, these are cave people.:::['1-2-20']
okay, they have issues like::::['1-2-21']
"gee, that glacier's getting kind of close." see?:::['1-2-22']
speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?:::['1-2-23']
no, no. - yes, it is. carol, hi.:::['1-2-24']
ross: okay. yes. yes, it is.:::['1-2-25']
how about i'll catch up with you in the ice age?:::['1-2-26']
so...:::['1-2-28', '9-2-302', '9-7-263', '9-4-284', '9-13-174', '7-19-127', '7-24-271', '7-5-301', '7-11-25', '10-3-288', '10-2-13', '2-15-280', '2-7-108', '2-4-147', '5-19-270', '5-8-148', '4-12-143', '4-11-130', '4-1-224', '3-20-337', '3-23-243', '3-13-331']
you look great.:::['1-2-29', '1-2-214', '9-4-42']
sorry. thanks. you look good too.:::['1-2-31']
well, you know, in here, anyone who......stands erect...:::['1-2-32']
so, what's new? still a... - a lesbian?:::['1-2-33']
you never know.:::['1-2-35']
how's, um...? how's the family?:::['1-2-36']
marty's still totally paranoid.:::['1-2-37']
oh, and... - carol, why are you here, carol?:::['1-2-38']
i'm pregnant. - pregnant.:::['1-2-39']
oh. looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all.:::['1-2-40']
i think this is the episode of three's company......where's there's some kind of misunderstanding.:::['1-2-41']
then i've already seen this one.:::['1-2-42']
are you through with that? thanks.:::['1-2-43']
yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.:::['1-2-44']
whose little ball of paper is this?:::['1-2-45']
oh, that would be mine.:::['1-2-46']
see, i wrote a note to myself, then i didn't need it.:::['1-2-47']
so i balled it up and now i wish i was dead.:::['1-2-48']
she already fluffed that pillow. monica, you know, you already fluffed...:::['1-2-49']
but it's fine.:::['1-2-50']
look, i'm sorry.:::['1-2-51']
i don't want to give them any more ammunition than they have.:::['1-2-52']
yes, we know how cruel a parent can be......about the flatness of a child's pillow.:::['1-2-53']
monica? hi. um...:::['1-2-54']
monica, um, you're scaring me.:::['1-2-55']
i mean, you're, like, all chaotic and twirly, you know?:::['1-2-56']
not in a good way.:::['1-2-57']
yeah, calm down.:::['1-2-58']
you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.:::['1-2-59']
that's because, as far as my parents are concerned, ross can do no wrong.:::['1-2-60']
you see, he's the prince.:::['1-2-61']
apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born.:::['1-2-62']
ew, ew, ew.:::['1-2-63', '2-10-309', '4-8-172']
what? - ugly naked guy got a thighmaster.:::['1-2-64']
has anybody seen my engagement ring? - yeah, it's beautiful.:::['1-2-66']
oh, god, oh, god, oh, god. - no, don't touch that.:::['1-2-68']
oh, like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough having to give it back to him.:::['1-2-69']
"hi, barry, remember me? i'm the girl......that stomped on your heart in front of your entire family":::['1-2-70']
oh, god. now i'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring......which makes it so much harder.:::['1-2-71']
easy, rach, we'll find it. won't we?:::['1-2-72']
oh, yeah. monica: okay, look.:::['1-2-73']
when did you have it on last?:::['1-2-74']
doy. probably right before she lost it.:::['1-2-75']
you don't get a lot of "doy" these days.:::['1-2-76']
i know i had it this morning.:::['1-2-77']
i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with...:::['1-2-78']
dinah?:::['1-2-79']
oh, don't be mad.:::['1-2-80']
you didn't. - oh, i'm sorry.:::['1-2-81']
i gave you one job.:::['1-2-82']
oh, but look how straight those noodles are.:::['1-2-83']
monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagna.:::['1-2-84']
i just can't do it.:::['1-2-85']
boys?:::['1-2-86']
we're going in.:::['1-2-87']
oh, that is not a happy "hi.":::['1-2-89']
carol's pregnant.:::['1-2-90']
oh, i found it.:::['1-2-91']
well, what...? what?:::['1-2-92']
do that for another two hours......you might be where i am right about now.:::['1-2-94']
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, mon?:::['1-2-95']
well, now, how do you fit into this whole thing?:::['1-2-96']
well, carol says she and susan want me to be involved.:::['1-2-97']
but if i'm not comfortable with it, i don't have to be involved.:::['1-2-98']
basically, it's totally up to me.:::['1-2-99']
she is so great. i miss her.:::['1-2-100']
what does she mean by "involved"?:::['1-2-101']
i mean, presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.:::['1-2-102']
anyway, they want me to go down to this......sonogram thing with them tomorrow.:::['1-2-103']
no matter what i do, though, i'm still gonna be a father.:::['1-2-106']
well, this is still ruined, right?:::['1-2-107']
oh. martha lugwin's daughter is gonna call you.:::['1-2-108']
mm. what's that curry taste?:::['1-2-109']
curry.:::['1-2-110']
i think they're great. i really do.:::['1-2-112']
you remember the lugwins?:::['1-2-113']
the big one had a thing for you, didn't she?:::['1-2-114']
they all had a thing for him.:::['1-2-115']
oh, mom.:::['1-2-116']
i'm sorry. why is this girl going to call me?:::['1-2-117']
oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking or food......or i don't know.:::['1-2-118']
anyway, i told her you had a restaurant, so...:::['1-2-119']
no, mom. i don't have a restaurant. i work in a restaurant.:::['1-2-120']
well, they don't have to know that.:::['1-2-121']
ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti.:::['1-2-122']
oh, we're having spaghetti. that's......easy.:::['1-2-124']
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish on my part......but were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing?:::['1-2-125']
because i think it might take some of the heat off me.:::['1-2-126']
what that rachel did to her life. we ran into her parents at the club.:::['1-2-127']
they were not playing very well.:::['1-2-128']
i'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding......but $40,000 is a lot of money.:::['1-2-129']
well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar.:::['1-2-130']
what's that supposed to mean? - nothing.:::['1-2-131']
it's an expression. - no, it's not.:::['1-2-132']
don't listen to your mother.:::['1-2-133']
you're independent and you always have been.:::['1-2-134']
even when you were a kid, and you were chubby......and you had no friends, you were just fine.:::['1-2-135']
you'd read alone in your room. and your puzzles...:::['1-2-136']
look, there are people, like ross, who need to shoot for the stars.:::['1-2-137']
with his museum and his papers getting published.:::['1-2-138']
other people are satisfied with staying where they are.:::['1-2-139']
i'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.:::['1-2-140']
and i read about these women trying to have it all, and i thank god......our little harmonica doesn't seem to have that problem.:::['1-2-141']
so, ross, what's going on with you?:::['1-2-142']
any stories? no news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?:::['1-2-143']
ahem. look, i, uh... i realize you guys have been wondering......what exactly happened between carol and me.:::['1-2-145']
and so, well, here's the deal.:::['1-2-146']
carol's a lesbian.:::['1-2-147']
she's living with a woman named susan.:::['1-2-148']
she's pregnant with my child.:::['1-2-149']
and she and susan are going to raise the baby.:::['1-2-150']
and you knew about this?:::['1-2-151']
your folks are really that bad, huh?:::['1-2-152']
well, you know, these people are pros.:::['1-2-153']
they know what they're doing. they take their time.:::['1-2-154']
they get the job done.:::['1-2-155']
boy, i know they say that you can't change your parents.:::['1-2-156']
boy, if you could, i'd want yours.:::['1-2-157']
must pee.:::['1-2-158']
you know, it's even worse when you're twins.:::['1-2-159']
you're a twin? - oh, yeah. we don't speak.:::['1-2-160']
she's like this high-powered, driven, career-type.:::['1-2-161']
what does she do? - she's a waitress.:::['1-2-162']
all right. you guys, i kind of gotta clean up now.:::['1-2-163']
chandler, you're an only child, right? you don't have any of this.:::['1-2-164']
well, no, although i did have an imaginary friend......who my parents actually preferred.:::['1-2-165']
rachel: hit the lights, please.:::['1-2-166']
how long was i in there?:::['1-2-167', '9-11-46']
i'm just cleaning up.:::['1-2-168']
oh, do you, uh...? do you need any help?:::['1-2-169']
um, okay, sure. thanks.:::['1-2-170']
so you nervous about barry tomorrow?:::['1-2-172']
oh, a little. - mm-hm.:::['1-2-173']
a lot. - mm-hm.:::['1-2-174']
so got any advice?:::['1-2-175']
you know, as someone who's recently been dumped.:::['1-2-176']
well, you may want to steer clear of the word "dumped.":::['1-2-177']
chances are he's going to be this broken shell of a man. you know?:::['1-2-178']
so you should try not to look too terrific. i know it'll be hard.:::['1-2-179']
or, you know, hey, i'll go down there, and i'll give barry back his ring.:::['1-2-180']
and you can go with carol and susan to the ob-gyn.:::['1-2-181']
you've got carol tomorrow.:::['1-2-182']
when did it get so complicated?:::['1-2-183']
got me.:::['1-2-184', '7-1-264']
remember when we were in high school? - yeah.:::['1-2-185']
i mean, didn't you think you' were gonna meet someone......fall in love, and that'd be it?:::['1-2-186']
ross? - yes, yes.:::['1-2-187']
oh. man. i never thought i'd be here.:::['1-2-188']
hi. sorry i'm late. i got stuck at work.:::['1-2-190']
there was this big dinosaur thing. anyway...:::['1-2-191']
ross, you remember susan. - how could i forget?:::['1-2-193']
hello, susan. good shake, good shake.:::['1-2-195']
so, uh, we're just waiting for?:::['1-2-196']
dr. oberman. - dr. oberman. okay, and is he...?:::['1-2-197']
she. - of course, "she.":::['1-2-198']
she, uh, familiar with our special situation?:::['1-2-199']
yes, and she's very supportive.:::['1-2-200']
great. okay, that's great. heh.:::['1-2-201']
no, i'm...:::['1-2-202']
quack, quack......quack, quack, quack.:::['1-2-204']
that opens my cervix.:::['1-2-206']
barry? barry: come on in.:::['1-2-207']
are you sure?:::['1-2-208', '7-3-9', '5-7-328', '5-13-281', '3-21-351']
barry: it's fine, it's fine. robbie's gonna be here for hours.:::['1-2-209']
so how are you doing?:::['1-2-211', '4-24-158']
yeah, well...:::['1-2-215', '9-4-265', '2-14-343']

i dumped him.:::['1-2-217']
ross. - so, um...? so how's this going to work......ahem, you know, with us?:::['1-2-220']
you know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?:::['1-2-221']
give me a "for instance.":::['1-2-222']
well, i don't know. okay, okay.:::['1-2-223']
how about with the baby's name? - marlon...:::['1-2-224']
marlon. ...if it's a boy. minnie, if it's a girl.:::['1-2-225']
as in "mouse"?:::['1-2-226']
as in my grandmother.:::['1-2-227']
still, you say "minnie," you hear "mouse.":::['1-2-228']
how about, um...:::['1-2-229']
how about "julia"?:::['1-2-230']
julia.:::['1-2-231']
we agreed on minnie.:::['1-2-232']
it's funny, um, we agreed we'd spend our lives together.:::['1-2-233']
things change. roll with the punches.:::['1-2-234']
i believe julia's on the table.:::['1-2-235']
oh. sorry about that.:::['1-2-236']
so, what have you been up to?:::['1-2-237']
oh. not much.:::['1-2-238']
i got a job. - hey, that's great.:::['1-2-239']

mindy?:::['1-2-249']
my maid of honor, mindy?:::['1-2-250']
yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.:::['1-2-251']
well, i'm...:::['1-2-252']
you got plugs.:::['1-2-253']
careful, careful. they haven't quite taken yet.:::['1-2-254']
and you got lenses.:::['1-2-255']
but you hate sticking your finger in your eye.:::['1-2-256']
not for her.:::['1-2-257']
listen, i really wanted to thank you.:::['1-2-259']
about a month ago, i wanted to hurt you......more than i've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life.:::['1-2-261']
and i'm an orthodontist.:::['1-2-262']
you know, you were right. i mean, i thought we were happy.:::['1-2-264']
we weren't happy.:::['1-2-265']
but with mindy......now i'm happy.:::['1-2-266']
spit. - what?:::['1-2-267']
me.:::['1-2-268', '9-20-308', '2-10-314']
anyway, um...:::['1-2-269']
i guess, uh... i guess this belongs to you.:::['1-2-270']
and thank you for giving it to me.:::['1-2-271']
well, thank you for giving it back.:::['1-2-272']
oh, please. what's wrong with helen?:::['1-2-274']
helen geller?:::['1-2-275']
i don't think so. - hello, it's not gonna be helen geller.:::['1-2-276']
no. i mean, it's not geller.:::['1-2-278']
what, it's gonna be helen willick?:::['1-2-279']
no, actually, um, we talked about helen willick bunch.:::['1-2-280']
well, wait a minute. why is she in the title?:::['1-2-281']
because it's my baby too.:::['1-2-282']
that's funny. really? i don't remember you making any sperm.:::['1-2-283']
and we all know what a challenge that is.:::['1-2-284']
uh-huh. see? - all right, you two, stop it.:::['1-2-285']
no, no. she gets a credit. hey, i'm in there too.:::['1-2-286']
honestly. you're not actually suggesting helen willick bunch geller.:::['1-2-287']
i think that borders on child abuse.:::['1-2-288']
of course not. i'm suggesting geller willick bunch.:::['1-2-289']
oh, no. no, no, no. you see what he's doing?:::['1-2-290']
he knows no one is gonna say all those names.:::['1-2-291']
he knows they'll wind up calling her geller. then he gets his way.:::['1-2-292']
my way? you think this is my way?:::['1-2-293']
believe me, of all the ways i ever imagined this moment in my life being......this is not my way. you know what? this is too hard.:::['1-2-294']
knock, knock. how are we today? any nausea?:::['1-2-295']
a little. - just a little.:::['1-2-296']
well, i was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.:::['1-2-297']
uh, lie back.:::['1-2-298']
you know what? i'm gonna go.:::['1-2-299']
um, i don't think i can be involved in this particular family thing.:::['1-2-300']
well, isn't that amazing?:::['1-2-304']
what are we supposed to be seeing here?:::['1-2-305']
i don't know, but i think it's about to attack the enterprise.:::['1-2-306']
you know, if you tilt your head to the left and relax your eyes......it kind of looks like an old potato.:::['1-2-307']
then don't do that, all right?:::['1-2-308']
are you welling up?:::['1-2-312']
no. - you are.:::['1-2-313']
you are. you're welling up. - no, i'm not.:::['1-2-314']
you're gonna be an aunt. - oh, shut up.:::['1-2-315']
hi, mindy.:::['1-2-316']

oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.:::['1-2-319']
no, it's okay. really, it's okay.:::['1-2-320']
i hope you two are very happy. i really do.:::['1-2-321']
and, min, you know, if everything works out......and you guys end up getting married and having kids and everything......i just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.:::['1-2-322']
okay, i know it was a cheap shot, but i feel so much better now.:::['1-2-323']
coffee.:::['1-15-0']
thank you. - cappuccino.:::['1-15-1']
and a nice hot cider for monica.:::['1-15-2']
aw, thank you.:::['1-15-3', '2-5-154']
rach? - yeah?:::['1-15-4']
why does my cinnamon stick have an eraser?:::['1-15-5']
oh, heh.:::['1-15-7', '5-14-17', '4-24-122']
that's why.:::['1-15-8']
friends s01e15: the one with the stoned guy:::['1-15-10']
tedlock: chandler?:::['1-15-11']
miss tedlock, you're looking lovely today.:::['1-15-12']
may i say that is a very flattering sleeve length on you?:::['1-15-13']
well, mr. costilick would like you to stop by his office at the end of the day.:::['1-15-14']
oh, listen, if this is about those prank memos, i had nothing to do with them.:::['1-15-15']
really, nothing at all. really.:::['1-15-16']
hey, you guys. you guys.:::['1-15-18']
chandler's coming, and he says he has this incredible news.:::['1-15-19']
so when he gets here, let's all act like, you know...:::['1-15-20']
never mind. but it was gonna be really good.:::['1-15-22']
ross: what's going on? rachel: what's up?:::['1-15-23']
it's a typical day at work. i'm inputting my numbers......and big al calls me into his office......and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.:::['1-15-24']
that is great! - congratulations.:::['1-15-25']
so i quit.:::['1-15-26']
both: why?:::['1-15-27']
why? this was supposed to be a temp job.:::['1-15-28']
yeah, chandler, you've been there for five years.:::['1-15-29']
i know, but if i took it this......it'd be like admitting that this is what i actually do.:::['1-15-30']
so was it a lot more money?:::['1-15-31']
doesn't matter. i just don't want to be one of those guys......that's in his office until 12:00 at night:::['1-15-32']
worrying about the wenus.:::['1-15-33']
"the wenus"?:::['1-15-34']
weekly estimated net usage system. it's a processing term.:::['1-15-35']
oh, that wenus.:::['1-15-36']
i don't know. that's the thing. i don't know.:::['1-15-38']
i'm not gonna figure it out working there.:::['1-15-39']

um, hi there.:::['1-15-43']
oh, yeah, i know. you're a chef, i know, and i thought of you first.:::['1-15-45']
but, um, chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...:::['1-15-46']
yeah, i just don't have a lot of chefing experience.:::['1-15-47']
unless it's an all-toast restaurant.:::['1-15-48']
yeah. yeah. - well, what kind of food is he looking for?:::['1-15-49']
he wants to do something eclectic, so he's looking for someone......who can, you know, create the entire menu.:::['1-15-50']
oh, my god. - yeah, i know.:::['1-15-51']
so, what do you think?:::['1-15-52', '1-12-209', '8-14-239', '8-15-83', '7-3-1', '10-9-214']
thanks, pheeb. i just don't really see myself in a big white hat.:::['1-15-53']

okay. he's a lawyer who teaches sculpting on the side.:::['1-11-23']
and he can dance.:::['1-11-24']
and he's the kind of guy who, when you're talking, he's listening......you know, and not saying, "yeah, i understand"......but wondering what you look like naked. - oh, stop it.:::['1-11-25']
i wish all guys could be like him.:::['1-11-26']

i don't mean that bad. - oh, no. i'm a fabulous mom.:::['1-11-64']
i bought my son his first condoms.:::['1-11-65']

phoebe: what about glen? monica: no.:::['1-11-71']

ooh, how about agamemnon?:::['1-11-73']
way too special.:::['1-11-74']
i'm famished. what do i want?:::['1-11-75']

uh, i'm not really a shot-drinking kind of guy.:::['1-11-86']
hi. sorry. sorry we're late.:::['1-11-87']
we, uh, kind of just, you know, lost track of time.:::['1-11-88']
but a man can change.:::['1-11-89']
anyone want me to appraise anything?:::['1-11-90']
mrs. bing, i have to tell you, i've read everything you've ever written.:::['1-11-91']
no, i mean it. when i read euphoria at midnight......all i wanted to do was become a writer.:::['1-11-92']
oh, please, honey. if i can do it, anybody can.:::['1-11-93']
you just start with half a dozen european cities......throw in 30 euphemisms for male genitalia......and, bam, you have got yourself a book.:::['1-11-94']
my mother, ladies and gentlemen.:::['1-11-95']

nora: okay, thank you.:::['1-11-100']
it's the italian hand-licker, isn't it?:::['1-11-101']
no. it's the one he's licking.:::['1-11-102']
she's supposed to be with you.:::['1-11-103']
you're good.:::['1-11-104', '4-12-36']
oh, ross, listen to me. i have sold 100 million copies of my books......and you know why?:::['1-11-105']
the girl on the cover with her nipples showing?:::['1-11-106']
no, because i know how to write men that women fall in love with.:::['1-11-107']
believe me, i cannot sell a paolo.:::['1-11-108']
people will not turn 325 pages for a paolo.:::['1-11-109']
come on. the guy's a secondary character.:::['1-11-110']
he's just a... you know, a complication you eventually kill off.:::['1-11-111']
when?:::['1-11-112', '8-16-244']
he's not a hero.:::['1-11-113']
you know who our hero is?:::['1-11-114']
the guy on the cover with his nipples showing?:::['1-11-115']
no, it's you.:::['1-11-116']
please. - no, really.:::['1-11-117']
come on. you're smart. you're sexy.:::['1-11-118']

yeah. - wait. come here.:::['1-11-124']
okay, uh, about last night......um, you know......chandler. you didn't tell...:::['1-11-125']
okay, i'm thinking we don't need to tell chandler.:::['1-11-126']
it was just a kiss. one kiss. no big deal, right?:::['1-11-127']
right. no big deal. - okay.:::['1-11-128']
in bizarro-world.:::['1-11-129']
you broke the code.:::['1-11-130']
what code? - you don't kiss your friend's mom.:::['1-11-131']
sisters are okay. maybe a hot-looking aunt.:::['1-11-132']
but not a mom. never a mom.:::['1-11-133']
what are you guys doing out here?:::['1-11-134']
uh, well, joey and i had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game.:::['1-11-135']
but, um, apparently somebody overslept.:::['1-11-136']
yeah, well, you don't have your racquet.:::['1-11-137']
no. no, i don't, because it's being restrung.:::['1-11-138']
ahem. somebody was supposed to bring me one.:::['1-11-139']
yeah. well, you didn't call and leave your grip size.:::['1-11-140']
okay, you guys are spending way too much time together.:::['1-11-141']
okay, i'm scum. i'm scum.:::['1-11-142']
ross, how could you let this happen? - i don't know.:::['1-11-143']
well, it's not like she's a regular mom. you know? she's sexy. she's...:::['1-11-144']
you don't think my mom's sexy?:::['1-11-145']
well, not in the same way.:::['1-11-146']
i'll have you know that gloria tribbiani......was a handsome woman in her day, all right?:::['1-11-147']
you think it's easy giving birth to seven children?:::['1-11-148']
okay, i think we're getting into a weird area here.:::['1-11-150']
aah. - hey.:::['1-11-151', '2-18-341']
hey. - what are you guys doing out here?:::['1-11-152']
well, ha, ha, not playing racquetball.:::['1-11-153']
he forgot to leave his grip size. - he didn't get the goggles.:::['1-11-154']
oh. right.:::['1-11-155', '4-17-101']
well, sounds like you two have issues.:::['1-11-156']
goodbye, baby.:::['1-11-157']
do they wait for me to do this?:::['1-11-158']
so are you gonna tell him? - i'm not gonna tell him.:::['1-11-159']
why would i tell him? - how about, because if you don't......his mother might? - hmm.:::['1-11-160']
what are you guys doing here?:::['1-11-161', '1-4-81']
uh, he's not even wearing a jock strap.:::['1-11-162']
what did i ask?:::['1-11-163']
nothing. i just thought i'd stop by, you know, after the, ahem...:::['1-11-166']
that i, you know. um, so, what are you doing here?:::['1-11-167']
i'm not really here.:::['1-11-168']
i just thought i'd drop these off on the way. my way.:::['1-11-169']
do you, um, come here a lot......without me?:::['1-11-170']
so, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?:::['1-11-172']
how would i know? i wasn't here.:::['1-11-173']
really? not even to, um, change his pajamas?:::['1-11-174']
you're my friend. i had to tell you.:::['1-11-176']
paolo kissed my mom?:::['1-11-178']
yeah, i mean, i don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink.:::['1-11-179']
i mean, you know how he gets when he's drunk...:::['1-11-180']
i can't do this. i did it.:::['1-11-181']
it was me. i'm sorry. i kissed your mom.:::['1-11-182']
i was really upset about rachel and paolo and i think i had too much tequila......and nora... mrs. mom, your bing, was...:::['1-11-184']
she was just being nice, you know? but nothing happened.:::['1-11-185']
nothing. ask joey. joey came in...:::['1-11-186']
you knew about this? - uh...:::['1-11-187']
you know, knowledge is a tricky thing.:::['1-11-188']
i spent the entire day with you. why didn't you tell me?:::['1-11-189']
hey, hey. you're lucky i caught them when i did......or else who knows what would've happened?:::['1-11-190']
thanks, man. big help.:::['1-11-191']
i can't believe this. what the hell were you thinking?:::['1-11-192']
i wasn't. i don't know. i...:::['1-11-193']
of all my friends, no one knows the crap i go through with my mom more than you.:::['1-11-194']
i know. - i can't believe you did this.:::['1-11-195']
me neither. - i'm mad at you for not telling me.:::['1-11-196']
what are you mad at me...? - let me slam the door.:::['1-11-197']
chandler, i didn't kiss her. he did.:::['1-11-198']
see what happens when you break the code?:::['1-11-199']
joey. - aah! uh.:::['1-11-200']
rach. - hey.:::['1-11-201']
"a woman undone. by rachel karen green.":::['1-11-202']
yeah, i thought i'd give it a shot. i'm still on the first chapter.:::['1-11-203']
now, do you think his "love stick" can be "liberated from its denim prison"?:::['1-11-204']
yeah, i'd say so.:::['1-11-205']
and there's no "j" in "engorged.":::['1-11-206']
hey, rach. - hey.:::['1-11-207']
hello. - hello.:::['1-11-208']
you going to the hospital tonight? - no. you?:::['1-11-209']
no. you?:::['1-11-210']
you just asked me.:::['1-11-211']
okay, maybe it was a trick question.:::['1-11-212']
um, rachel, can we do this now? - okay.:::['1-11-213']
i am so hot.:::['1-11-214']
and here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day.:::['1-11-215']
now, you tell me she's not a knockout.:::['1-11-216']
i cannot believe we're having this conversation.:::['1-11-217']
come on, just try to picture her not pregnant. that's all.:::['1-11-218']
central perk is proud to present miss phoebe buffay.:::['1-11-219']
phoebe: thanks.:::['1-11-220', '1-7-1']
hi. um, ahem. okay.:::['1-11-221']
i'd like to start with a song that's about a man i recently met......who's, um, come to be very important to me.:::['1-11-222']
you don't have to be awake to be my man:::['1-11-224']
long as you have brain waves i'll be there to hold your hand:::['1-11-225']
though we just met the other day:::['1-11-226']
there's something i have got to say:::['1-11-227']
okay, thank you very much. i'm gonna take a short break.:::['1-11-228']
rachel: okay, that was phoebe buffay, everybody. whoo!:::['1-11-229']
what the hell was that? - phoebe just started...:::['1-11-230']
i believe i was talking to joey. all right, there, mother-kisser?:::['1-11-231']
"mother-kisser.":::['1-11-232']
i'll shut up.:::['1-11-233']
chandler, can i say something? i know you're still mad at me.:::['1-11-234']
i just wanna say that there were two people there that night, okay?:::['1-11-235']
there were two sets of lips. - yes, well, i expect this from her.:::['1-11-236']
okay? she's always been a freudian nightmare.:::['1-11-237']
okay, but if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?:::['1-11-238']
because it's complicated. it's complex.:::['1-11-239']
hey, you kissed my mom.:::['1-11-240']
we're rehearsing a greek play.:::['1-11-241']
that's funny. we done now? - no.:::['1-11-242']
okay, you mean you're not gonna talk to her, tell her how you feel?:::['1-11-243']
that would be a no. just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom......doesn't mean you know her, all right? trust me, you can't talk to her.:::['1-11-244']
okay. "you can't"? or you can't?:::['1-11-245']
okay, that's my finger. okay, that's my knee.:::['1-11-246']
still doing the play.:::['1-11-247']
all right, what did you do with him?:::['1-11-248']
you're awake. - look at you.:::['1-11-249']
how do you feel?:::['1-11-250', '8-1-151']
uh, a little woozy, but basically okay.:::['1-11-251']
gosh, you look good.:::['1-11-252']
i feel good.:::['1-11-253']
who are you?:::['1-11-254', '9-4-112', '7-15-286', '3-6-150']
sorry. - i'm phoebe buffay.:::['1-11-255']
i'm monica geller. i've been taking care of you.:::['1-11-256']
we both have.:::['1-11-257']
so the etch a sketch is from you guys? - actually, it's just from me.:::['1-11-258']
yeah, i got you the foot massager. - know who shaved you? that was me.:::['1-11-259']
i read to you. - i sang. ha.:::['1-11-260']
well, thanks.:::['1-11-261', '2-7-299', '3-3-41']
oh, my pleasure. - you're welcome.:::['1-11-262']
so i guess i'll see you around.:::['1-11-263']
what? that's it?:::['1-11-264']
"see you around"?:::['1-11-265']
well, what do you want me to say? - well, i don't know.:::['1-11-266']
maybe, uh::::['1-11-267']
"that was nice.:::['1-11-268']
it meant something to me.:::['1-11-269']
i'll call you.":::['1-11-270']
all right. i'll call you. - i don't think you mean that.:::['1-11-271']
this is so typical.:::['1-11-272']
you know, we give......and we give......and we give.:::['1-11-273']
and then we just get nothing back.:::['1-11-274']
and then one day, it's just, you know, you wake up and "see you around.":::['1-11-275']
let's go, phoebe.:::['1-11-276']
you know what? we thought you were different.:::['1-11-277']
but i guess it was just the coma.:::['1-11-278']
nora: the car's running downstairs.:::['1-11-279']
i wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends.:::['1-11-280']
anything you want from lisbon? - no, just knowing you're there is enough.:::['1-11-281']
all right. well, be good. i love you.:::['1-11-282']
you kissed my best ross.:::['1-11-283']
or something to that effect.:::['1-11-284']
look, it was stupid.:::['1-11-286']
really stupid. - really stupid.:::['1-11-287']
and i don't even know how it happened.:::['1-11-288']
i'm sorry, honey. i promise it will never happen again.:::['1-11-289']
are we okay now? - yeah.:::['1-11-290']
ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.:::['1-11-292']
shh.:::['1-11-293', '9-2-268', '10-2-4', '2-8-71', '2-22-181', '5-10-18', '4-11-105', '4-23-67', '3-25-299']
he did it. he told her off. and not just about the kiss, about everything.:::['1-11-294']
you're kidding? - no.:::['1-11-295']
he said, "when are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?":::['1-11-296']
wow. - wait, then she came back with::::['1-11-297']
"the question is, when are you gonna grow up and realize i have a bomb?":::['1-11-298']
okay, wait. are you sure she didn't say::::['1-11-299']
"when are you gonna grow up and realize i am your mom?":::['1-11-300']
that makes more sense. - you think?:::['1-11-301']
so, what's going on now?:::['1-11-303']
i don't know. i've been standing here spelling it out for you.:::['1-11-304']
i don't hear anything. wait, wait, wait.:::['1-11-305']
what do you see?:::['1-11-306']
it's hard to tell. they're so tiny and upside down.:::['1-11-307']
wait, wait, wait.:::['1-11-308', '10-13-142', '4-9-164']
they're walking away. they're walking away.:::['1-11-309']
no, they're not. they're coming right at us. run, run!:::['1-11-310']
you okay, kiddo?:::['1-11-311']
yeah, i'm okay. - all right. you be good.:::['1-11-312']
drive safe.:::['1-11-313']
mrs. bing. - mr. geller.:::['1-11-314']
you mean that?:::['1-11-316']
yeah, why not?:::['1-11-317']
so i told her. - oh.:::['1-11-318']
how did it go? - awful. awful.:::['1-11-319']
couldn't have gone worse.:::['1-11-320']
well, how do you feel? - pretty good.:::['1-11-321']
i told her.:::['1-11-322']
well, see?:::['1-11-323']
so maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, you know, me kissing your mom, huh?:::['1-11-324']
but we don't have to go down that road.:::['1-11-325']
now, this is just the first chapter......and i want your absolute honest opinion. okay?:::['1-11-326']
oh, and on page two, he's not reaching for her "heaving beasts.":::['1-11-327']
what's a "niffle"?:::['1-11-328']
you can usually find them on the heaving beasts.:::['1-11-329']
all right, all right, so i'm not a great typist.:::['1-11-330']
wait, did you get to the part about his "huge, throbbing pens"?:::['1-11-331']
tell you, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those.:::['1-11-332']
all right, that's it. give them back. group: no.:::['1-11-333']
oh, look, look! there's joey's picture!:::['1-6-0']
this is so exciting!:::['1-6-1']
you can spot someone who's never seen his plays.:::['1-6-2']
notice, no fear. no sense of impending doom.:::['1-6-3']
the exclamation point scares me.:::['1-6-4']
it's not just freud, it's freud!:::['1-6-5']
ross: shh. magic is about to happen!:::['1-6-6']
well, eva......we've done some excellent work here.:::['1-6-7']
and i would have to say......your problem is quite clear.:::['1-6-8']
to play with or simply let hang:::['1-6-12']
friends s01e06: the one with the butt:::['1-6-13']
did anybody else feel like peeling their skin off......to have something else to do?:::['1-6-15']
ross, 10:00.:::['1-6-16']
is it? it feels like 2.:::['1-6-17']
no, 10:00!:::['1-6-18']
there's a beautiful woman at 8, 9, 10:00!:::['1-6-19']
ross: hello!:::['1-6-20']
she's amazing!:::['1-6-21']
she makes the women i dream about look like short, fat, bald men.:::['1-6-22']
go over to her. she's not with anyone.:::['1-6-23']
and what would my opening line be?:::['1-6-24']
excuse me...:::['1-6-25']
come on, she's a person. you can do it.:::['1-6-26']
could she be more out of my league? ross, back me up.:::['1-6-27']
he could never get a woman like that in a million years.:::['1-6-28']
but you always see these beautiful women with these "nothing" guys.:::['1-6-29']
you could be one of those guys.:::['1-6-30']
you could do that. - you think?:::['1-6-31']
rachel: absolutely!:::['1-6-32']
i can't believe i'm even considering this.:::['1-6-33']
i'm very aware of my tongue. - come on.:::['1-6-34']
here goes.:::['1-6-35', '1-7-170', '9-6-391']
hi. um... ahem.:::['1-6-37']
okay, next word would be......uh, chandler.:::['1-6-38']
chandler is my name and, uh...:::['1-6-39']
hi!:::['1-6-40', '9-20-148', '7-6-123', '10-13-0', '5-2-56', '5-12-277']
yes, you said that.:::['1-6-41']
yes! yes, i did. but what i didn't say...:::['1-6-42']
what i wanted to say was, uh......would you like to go out with me? thank you. good night.:::['1-6-43']
phoebe: there he is!:::['1-6-45']
ross: i didn't know you could dance! rachel: you were in a play!:::['1-6-46', '1-6-48']
what'd you think?:::['1-6-47']
come on, it wasn't that bad. i was the lead.:::['1-6-49']
it was better than the troll thing. at least you got to see my head.:::['1-6-50']
rachel: you're right. ross: we saw your head.:::['1-6-51']
she said yes! she said yes!:::['1-6-52']
monica: wow!:::['1-6-53']
awful play, man! whoa!:::['1-6-54']
her name's aurora. she's italian and she pronounces my name "chandler.":::['1-6-55']
i like that better. the usher gave me this to give to you.:::['1-6-56']
what is it? - the estelle leonard talent agency.:::['1-6-57']
an agency left me its card. maybe they wanna sign me!:::['1-6-58']
based on this play?:::['1-6-59']
based on this play!:::['1-6-60']
hey, kids!:::['1-6-61']
ross: hey, chandler.:::['1-6-62']
no, because this line is passion, and this is just a line.:::['1-6-63']
i've been here seven seconds, and you haven't asked me how my date went.:::['1-6-64']
how was your date, chandler?:::['1-6-65']
it was unbelievable!:::['1-6-66', '2-8-2']
i've never met anyone like her. she's had the most amazing life!:::['1-6-67']
chandler: she was in the israeli army.:::['1-6-68']
none of the bullets hit the engine block......so we made it to the border.:::['1-6-69']
but just barely and i...:::['1-6-70']
i've been talking about myself all night long. i'm sorry.:::['1-6-71']
what about you? tell me your stories.:::['1-6-72']
all right, once......once i got on the subway, right?:::['1-6-73']
and it was at night......and i rode it all the way to brooklyn......just for the hell of it.:::['1-6-74']
we talked till 2. it was this perfect evening.:::['1-6-75']
more or less.:::['1-6-76']
suddenly, we realized we were in yemen.:::['1-6-77']
i'm sorry, so "we" is?:::['1-6-78']
"we" is me and rick.:::['1-6-79']
who's rick? - who's rick?:::['1-6-80']
my husband.:::['1-6-81']
oh, so you're divorced? - no.:::['1-6-83']
i'm sorry. so you're widowed? hopefully?:::['1-6-84']
no, i'm still married.:::['1-6-85']
so how would your husband feel about you sitting here with me......sliding your foot so far up my leg......you can count the change in my pocket?:::['1-6-86']
don't worry.:::['1-6-87']
i imagine he'd be okay with you because he's okay with ethan.:::['1-6-88']
ethan? there's an ethan?:::['1-6-89']
ethan is my......boyfriend.:::['1-6-90']
all: what?:::['1-6-91', '4-4-266', '3-23-64']
so, uh, what kind of relationship do you imagine us having......if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?:::['1-6-92']
i suppose, mainly sexual.:::['1-6-93']
i'm sorry it didn't work out.:::['1-6-95']
what not work out? i'm seeing her again on thursday.:::['1-6-96']
didn't you listen to the story?:::['1-6-97']
how could you get involved with a woman like this?:::['1-6-98']
i had trouble with it at first, but i get all the good stuff.:::['1-6-99']
all the fun, all the talking, all the sex......and no responsibility.:::['1-6-100']
this is every guy's fantasy!:::['1-6-101']
that is not true. ross, is this your fantasy?:::['1-6-102']
yeah. yeah, it is.:::['1-6-104']
you'd go out with someone else who's going out with someone else?:::['1-6-105']
i couldn't.:::['1-6-106']
good for you.:::['1-6-107', '9-15-124', '4-2-152']
when i'm with a woman, i need to know......that i'm going out with more people than she is.:::['1-6-108']
you know......monogamy can be a tricky concept.:::['1-6-109']
i mean, anthropologically...:::['1-6-110']
fine. now you'll never know.:::['1-6-111']
we're kidding. tell us.:::['1-6-112']
monica: we wanna know. joey: come on!:::['1-6-113']
all right. there's a theory put forth by richard leakey...:::['1-6-114']
ta-da!:::['1-6-115']
are we greeting each other this way now? i like that.:::['1-6-116']
look! i cleaned!:::['1-6-117']
i did the windows. i did the floors.:::['1-6-118']
i used all the attachments on the vacuum except for that round one.:::['1-6-119']
i don't know what it's for.:::['1-6-120']
nobody knows, and we're not supposed to ask.:::['1-6-121']
rachel: what do you think?:::['1-6-122']
chandler: it's very clean. monica: really, it looks great!:::['1-6-123']
oh. heh. i see you moved the green ottoman.:::['1-6-124']
ross & phoebe: uh-oh.:::['1-6-125']
i don't know. i thought it looked better there.:::['1-6-127']
and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.:::['1-6-128']
yeah, it's interesting.:::['1-6-129']
but you know what? just for fun......let's see what it looked like in the old spot.:::['1-6-130']
just to compare.:::['1-6-131']
let's see. ha!:::['1-6-132']
well, it looks good there too.:::['1-6-133']
let's leave it there for a while.:::['1-6-134']
i can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.:::['1-6-135']
thank god you didn't fan out the magazines.:::['1-6-136']
she'll scratch your eyes out.:::['1-6-137']
you guys, i am not that bad!:::['1-6-138']
yeah, you are.:::['1-6-139', '4-3-128']
remember, i lived with you?:::['1-6-140']
you were a little, you know...:::['1-6-141']
that is so unfair!:::['1-6-142']
when we were kids, yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy.:::['1-6-143']
okay, so i'm responsible. i'm organized.:::['1-6-144']
but, hey, i can be a kook!:::['1-6-145']
all right, you madcap gal!:::['1-6-146']
try to imagine this.:::['1-6-147']
the phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.:::['1-6-148']
why not? - because you're a kook!:::['1-6-149']
instead, you wait until they send you a notice.:::['1-6-150']
okay, then you let me go grocery shopping......and i buy laundry detergent.:::['1-6-152']
but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.:::['1-6-153']
why would someone do that?:::['1-6-154']
one might wonder.:::['1-6-155']
a glass is on the table. there's no coaster.:::['1-6-156']
it's a cold drink. it's a hot day.:::['1-6-157']
beads of condensation are inching their way closer to the wood...:::['1-6-158']
stop it!:::['1-6-159', '4-19-12', '3-2-320']
it's true. who am i?:::['1-6-161']
monica, you're mom.:::['1-6-162']
joey: uh-huh? oh, my god!:::['1-6-163']
okay, i'll be there.:::['1-6-165']
that was my agent.:::['1-6-166']
my agent has just gotten me a job in the new al pacino movie!:::['1-6-167']
chandler: whoa! that's great!:::['1-6-168']
what's the part?:::['1-6-169']
can you believe this? al pacino!:::['1-6-170']
this guy's why i became an actor.:::['1-6-171']
"i'm out of order? you're out of order!:::['1-6-172']
this whole courtroom's out of order!":::['1-6-173']
seriously, what's the part?:::['1-6-174']
"just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!":::['1-6-175']
come on. seriously, joey, what's the part?:::['1-6-176']
you're, you're... what?:::['1-6-177']
i'm his butt double, okay?:::['1-6-178']
all right? he goes into the shower, and then......i'm his butt.:::['1-6-180']
come on, you guys.:::['1-6-182', '5-6-255', '3-18-123']
this is a real movie, and al pacino's in it and that's big!:::['1-6-183']
oh, no, it's terrific.:::['1-6-184']
after all your years of struggling......you've finally been able to crack your way into show business.:::['1-6-185']
okay, fine. make jokes, i don't care.:::['1-6-186']
this is a big break for me!:::['1-6-187']
you're right. it is.:::['1-6-188']
so are you gonna invite us all to the big opening?:::['1-6-189']
i need to borrow some moisturizer. - for what?:::['1-6-190']
what do you think? today's the big day!:::['1-6-191']
okay, go into the bathroom. use whatever you want.:::['1-6-192']
just don't ever tell me what you did in there.:::['1-6-193']
joey: thank you.:::['1-6-194', '2-5-152', '3-5-344']
joey's mom's on the phone. - he's in the bathroom.:::['1-6-195']
you don't wanna go in there! - come on, we're roommates.:::['1-6-196']
my eyes! my eyes!:::['1-6-197']
monica: i warned you.:::['1-6-198']
who is being loud?:::['1-6-199']
oh, that would be monica.:::['1-6-200']
can i borrow some things? i wanna make aurora breakfast.:::['1-6-201']
you got the whole night, huh?:::['1-6-202']
well, i only have 20 minutes until ethan, so...:::['1-6-203']
do i sense a bit of resentment?:::['1-6-204']
no, no, no. no resentment. believe me......it's worth it, okay?:::['1-6-205']
in a relationship, you have these key moments......you'll remember for the rest of your life.:::['1-6-206']
well, every single second is like that with aurora.:::['1-6-207']
and i've just wasted 35 of them talking to you.:::['1-6-208']
so, uh, monica, can you help me with the door?:::['1-6-209']
um, chandler, you know, the old monica would remind you......to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush.:::['1-6-210']
but i'm not gonna do that.:::['1-6-211']
director: damn it! hire the girl.:::['1-6-212']
okay, everybody ready?:::['1-6-213']
uh, listen, i just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.:::['1-6-214']
lose the robe.:::['1-6-215']
me?:::['1-6-216', '2-2-243', '4-4-110']
that would work.:::['1-6-217']
right. okay. losing the robe!:::['1-6-218']
okay, and the robe is lost.:::['1-6-219']
everybody, i would like to get this in one take.:::['1-6-220']
let's roll it.:::['1-6-221']
water's working.:::['1-6-222']
and action!:::['1-6-223', '1-6-233', '9-19-63', '7-23-71']
and cut!:::['1-6-224']
butt guy, what are you doing?:::['1-6-225']
i'm showering.:::['1-6-226']
no, that was clenching.:::['1-6-227']
well, the way i see it, the guy's upset here, you know?:::['1-6-228']
his wife's dead, his brother's missing.:::['1-6-229']
i think his butt would be angry here.:::['1-6-230']
i think his butt would like to get the shot before lunch.:::['1-6-231']
once again, rolling. water working.:::['1-6-232']
and cut! what was that?:::['1-6-234']
i was going for quiet desperation.:::['1-6-235']
but if you have to ask...:::['1-6-236']
god, i love these fingers.:::['1-6-237']
no, actually, i meant my fingers.:::['1-6-239']
look at them. look at how happy they are.:::['1-6-240']
oh, my god, i'm late! - oh, no, no, no.:::['1-6-241']
don't go, don't go. - okay, okay.:::['1-6-242']
i have to. - look, she's leaving.:::['1-6-243']
i'm sorry. he'll be waiting for me.:::['1-6-244']
i thought you talked to rick.:::['1-6-245']
it's not rick.:::['1-6-246']
ethan? he gets the whole day with you!:::['1-6-247']
no, it's andrew.:::['1-6-248']
i know there'll be many moments......when i'll regret asking the following question, but...:::['1-6-249']
and andrew is?:::['1-6-250']
he's... new.:::['1-6-251']
so you're not completely fulfilled by rick, ethan and myself?:::['1-6-252']
no, that's not exactly what i was...:::['1-6-253']
most women would kill......for three guys like us.:::['1-6-254']
so, what do you want?:::['1-6-255']
you have me. - no, no. just you.:::['1-6-257']
lose the other guys.:::['1-6-259']
like, all of them?:::['1-6-260']
come on, we're great together. why not?:::['1-6-261']
why can't we just have what we have now?:::['1-6-262']
why can't we just talk, laugh and make love......without feeling obligated to one another?:::['1-6-263']
up until tonight, i thought that's what you wanted too.:::['1-6-264']
well, part of me wants that......but it's like i'm two guys.:::['1-6-265']
i mean, one guy's saying, "shut up! this is great!":::['1-6-266']
but there's this other guy.:::['1-6-267']
it's the guy who wells up every time the grinch's heart......grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device.:::['1-6-268']
he's saying, you know, "this is too hard. get out, get out!":::['1-6-269']
so which one of the two guys will you listen to?:::['1-6-270']
i have to listen to both. they don't let each other finish.:::['1-6-271']
which one?:::['1-6-272', '9-20-40']
the second guy.:::['1-6-273']
call me if you change your mind.:::['1-6-275']
sorry, the first guy runs the lips.:::['1-6-276']
look at it this way. you dumped her!:::['1-6-277']
right? i mean, this woman was......unbelievably sexy......and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable...:::['1-6-278']
tell me why you did this again?:::['1-6-279']
ross: hey!  monica: hey!:::['1-6-280']
rachel: movie star!:::['1-6-281']
aren't you the guy who plays the butt in the new al pacino movie?:::['1-6-282']
nope.:::['1-6-283', '5-24-120', '5-21-6', '3-2-28', '3-1-41', '3-1-97']
no? what happened, big guy?:::['1-6-284']
big guy?:::['1-6-285']
it felt like a "big guy" moment.:::['1-6-286']
i got fired!:::['1-6-287']
they said i acted too much with it.:::['1-6-288']
i told everybody about this.:::['1-6-289']
everybody will be expecting to see me.:::['1-6-290']
you know what? no one will be able to tell.:::['1-6-291']
my mom will.:::['1-6-292']
there's something so sweet......and disturbing about that.:::['1-6-293']
i've done nothing but crappy plays for six years......and i finally get my shot, and i blow it!:::['1-6-294']
maybe this wasn't your shot.:::['1-6-295']
i think when it's your shot, you know it's your shot.:::['1-6-296']
did it feel like your shot?:::['1-6-297']
hard to tell. i was naked.:::['1-6-298']
i don't think this was your shot.:::['1-6-299']
i don't even think you just get one shot.:::['1-6-300']
i really believe big things are gonna happen for you. i do.:::['1-6-301']
you've gotta keep thinking about the day that some kid will go......"i got the part! i'm gonna be joey tribbiani's ass!":::['1-6-302']
you think? that's so nice.:::['1-6-303']
oh, come here.:::['1-6-304']
i'm sorry, joey. i'm gonna go to bed, guys.:::['1-6-305']
ross: good night.:::['1-6-306', '3-25-340']
rachel: you're gonna leave your shoes out here?:::['1-6-307']
really? just casually strewn about......in that reckless, haphazard manner?:::['1-6-309']
it doesn't matter. i'll get them tomorrow. or not!:::['1-6-310']
whenever.:::['1-6-311', '3-10-8']
she is a kook.:::['1-6-312']
if it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes.:::['1-6-313']
no, don't do this!:::['1-6-314']
this is stupid!:::['1-6-315']
i don't have to prove anything. i'm gonna go get them.:::['1-6-316']
but then everyone will know.:::['1-6-317']
unless i get them, and then wake up really early and put them back.:::['1-6-318']
i need help!:::['1-6-319']
everybody. shh. uh, central perk is proud to present......the music of miss phoebe buffay.:::['1-7-0']
hi. um, i wanna start with a song that's about that moment......when you suddenly realize what life is really all about.:::['1-7-2']
okay. thank you very much.:::['1-7-4']
chandler: what...?:::['1-7-5']
oh, great. this is just...:::['1-7-6']

hi, mom, it's jill.:::['1-7-22']
she's right. it's jill. jill goodacre.:::['1-7-23']
i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre.:::['1-7-25']
is it a vestibule? maybe it's an atrium?:::['1-7-26']
yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot.:::['1-7-27']
yeah, i'm fine. i'm just stuck at the bank in an atm vestibule.:::['1-7-28']
jill says vestibule......i'm going with vestibule.:::['1-7-29']
jill: i'm fine.:::['1-7-30']
no, i'm not alone.:::['1-7-31']
i don't know. some guy.:::['1-7-32']
oh, some guy. i am some guy.:::['1-7-33']
hey, jill, i saw you with some guy last night.:::['1-7-34']
yes, he was some guy.:::['1-7-35']
joey: hey, everyone.:::['1-7-36']
officiating at tonight's blackout is rabbi tribbiani.:::['1-7-37']
chandler's old roommate was jewish, and these are the only candles we have......so happy hanukkah.:::['1-7-38']
phoebe: ooh, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.:::['1-7-39']
ooh. that had to hurt.:::['1-7-42', '10-10-191']
...and you still haven't said one word. oh, god.:::['1-7-43']
do something. just make contact. smile.:::['1-7-44']
you're definitely scaring her.:::['1-7-46']
uh, would you like to call somebody?:::['1-7-47']
yeah, about 300 guys i went to high school with.:::['1-7-48']
yeah, thanks.:::['1-7-49', '8-4-32', '2-17-313']
it's me. - it's chandler.:::['1-7-51']
i'm stuck in an atm vestibule......with jill goodacre.:::['1-7-54']
i'm stuck......in an atm vestibule......with jill goodacre.:::['1-7-56', '1-7-60']
i have no idea what you said.:::['1-7-57']
put joey on the phone.:::['1-7-58']
what's up, man?:::['1-7-59']
he's trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre.:::['1-7-62']
chandler, listen.:::['1-7-63']
yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.:::['1-7-64']
rachel: come on, somebody.:::['1-7-65']
monica: i'll go. i'll go.:::['1-7-66']
okay, um, senior year of college, on a pool table.:::['1-7-67']
joey: ooh. - pool table?:::['1-7-68']
that's my sister.:::['1-7-69', '7-12-155']
okay, okay. my weirdest place would have to be......the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library.:::['1-7-70']
oh, my god. what were you doing in a library?:::['1-7-71']
pheebs, what about you? - oh, um, milwaukee.:::['1-7-72']
disneyland, 1989. "it's a small world after all.":::['1-7-74']
the, uh, ride broke down......so carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children.:::['1-7-76']
they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom.:::['1-7-77']
ooh. rachel?:::['1-7-78']
i already went.:::['1-7-79']
you did not go. - yes, i did.:::['1-7-80']
monica: tell us. come on.:::['1-7-81']
all right, uh, the weirdest place would have to be......the foot of the bed.:::['1-7-82']
step back. - we have a winner.:::['1-7-83']
i've never had a relationship with that kind of passion.:::['1-7-84']
where you have to have somebody right there in the middle of a theme park.:::['1-7-85']
it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.:::['1-7-86']
well, barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature-golf course.:::['1-7-87']
come on. - no.:::['1-7-88']
he said we were holding up the people behind us.:::['1-7-89']
and you didn't marry him because?:::['1-7-90']
do you think there are people that go through life......never having that kind of?:::['1-7-91']
probably. - really?:::['1-7-92']
i'll tell you something. passion is way overrated.:::['1-7-93']
yeah, right. - it is.:::['1-7-94']
eventually, it kind of burns out.:::['1-7-95']
but hopefully what you're left with is trust and security and, uh...:::['1-7-96']
in my ex-wife's case, lesbianism.:::['1-7-97']
for all those people who miss out on that, uh, passion thing......there's other good stuff.:::['1-7-98']
but, um, i don't think that'll be you.:::['1-7-100']
you don't? - mm-mm.:::['1-7-101']
see, i see, uh......big passion in your future.:::['1-7-102']
really? - mm-hm.:::['1-7-103']
you do? - i do.:::['1-7-104']
ross, you're so great.:::['1-7-105']
ross: ah.:::['1-7-106', '2-21-24']
it's never gonna happen.:::['1-7-107', '4-21-69']
what? - you and rachel.:::['1-7-108']
because you waited too long to make your move......and now you're in the "friend zone.":::['1-7-110']
no, no, no. i'm not in the zone.:::['1-7-111']
no, ross. you're mayor of the zone.:::['1-7-112']
look, i'm taking my time, all right?:::['1-7-113']
i'm laying the groundwork.:::['1-7-114']
every day i get a little bit closer to, uh...:::['1-7-115']
priesthood.:::['1-7-116']
ross, i'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking.:::['1-7-117']
if you don't ask her out soon, you'll end up stuck in the zone forever.:::['1-7-118']
i will, i will.:::['1-7-119']
i'm waiting for the, uh, right moment.:::['1-7-120']
what, now? - yeah.:::['1-7-122']
what's messing you up? the wine?:::['1-7-123']
the candles? the moonlight? huh?:::['1-7-124']
you gotta go up to her and say, "look, rachel, i think...":::['1-7-125']
shh! - shh!:::['1-7-126']
what are we shushing? - we're shushing......because we're trying to hear something.:::['1-7-127']
what? - uh, don't you hear that?:::['1-7-128']
see? - huh.:::['1-7-130']
would you like some gum? - oh. is it sugarless?:::['1-7-131']
uh, sorry, it's not. - then, no, thanks.:::['1-7-132']
mental note: if jill goodacre offers you gum, you take it.:::['1-7-133']
if she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.:::['1-7-134']
and the milk is getting sour:::['1-7-135']
but to me it is not scary:::['1-7-136']
'cause i stay away from dairy:::['1-7-137']
la-la la-la-la-la-la:::['1-7-138']
here goes. - you'll do it?:::['1-7-139']
i'll do it. - want help?:::['1-7-140']
you come out there, you're a dead man.:::['1-7-141']
ross, ross.:::['1-7-142']
good luck, man.:::['1-7-143']
joey: where you going? monica: outside.:::['1-7-146']
you can't go out there.:::['1-7-147']
why not? - because of, uh, the reason.:::['1-7-148']
and that would be?:::['1-7-149']
i, uh... i can't tell you.:::['1-7-150']
okay, listen. you gotta promise you'll never, ever tell ross that i told you.:::['1-7-152']
about what? - he's planning your birthday party.:::['1-7-153']
oh, my god. i love him.:::['1-7-154']
you better act surprised.:::['1-7-155']
about what? - my surprise party.:::['1-7-156']
what surprise party? - oh, stop it. joey already told me.:::['1-7-157']
well, he didn't tell me.:::['1-7-158']
don't look at me. this is ross' thing.:::['1-7-159']
this is so typical. i'm always the last to know everything.:::['1-7-160']
you are not. we tell you stuff. - uh-huh.:::['1-7-161']
i was the last one to know when chandler got bit by the peacock at the zoo.:::['1-7-162']
i was the last to know you had a crush on joey when he was moving in.:::['1-7-163']
oh. looks like i was second to last.:::['1-7-165']
it's so nice.:::['1-7-166']
hey, i have a question.:::['1-7-167', '2-6-344']
uh, actually, it's not so much a question......it's more of a general wondering......ment.:::['1-7-168']
um, well, for a while now, i've been wanting to, um...:::['1-7-171']
oh. - yes, that's right.:::['1-7-172']
look at that little kitty.:::['1-7-173']
and the only explanation i can find:::['1-7-175', '4-21-79']
is the love that i found ever since you've been around:::['1-7-176']
all right, this is just bactine. it won't hurt.:::['1-7-177']
ow. ow.:::['1-7-178']
sorry, that was wax.:::['1-7-179']
poor little tootie's scared. we should find his owner.:::['1-7-180']
why not put "poor little tootie" in the hall?:::['1-7-181']
during a blackout? she'll get trampled.:::['1-7-182']
you know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.:::['1-7-184']
gum would be perfection.:::['1-7-185']
could've said, "gum would be nice." "i'll have a stick." but, no.:::['1-7-186']
for me, gum is perfection.:::['1-7-187']
i loathe myself.:::['1-7-188']
oh, no, the mellons. they hate all living things, right?:::['1-7-189']
phoebe: oh.:::['1-7-190', '8-24-222', '8-9-227', '2-8-68', '2-12-55', '2-17-136']
hi. we just found this cat......and we're looking for the owner.:::['1-7-191']
um, yeah, it's, uh... it's mine.:::['1-7-192']
he seems to hate you. are you sure?:::['1-7-193']
yeah. it's my cat. give me my cat.:::['1-7-194']
wait a minute. what's his name?:::['1-7-195']
um, bob... buttons.:::['1-7-196']
bob buttons? - uh-huh.:::['1-7-197']
bob buttons. here, bob buttons.:::['1-7-198']
you are a very bad man.:::['1-7-200']
you owe me a cat.:::['1-7-201']
rachel: here, kitty, kitty, kitty.:::['1-7-202']
here, kitty, kitty.:::['1-7-203']
where did you go, little kitty, kitty, kitty?:::['1-7-204']
kitty, kitty, kitty. come here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...:::['1-7-205']
come on, lucky sixes.:::['1-7-208']
everybody, this is paolo.:::['1-7-209']
paolo, i want you to meet my friends.:::['1-7-210']
this is monica... - hi.:::['1-7-211']
...and joey... monica: hi.:::['1-7-212']
...and ross. monica: hi.:::['1-7-213']
ha, ha. he doesn't speak much english.:::['1-7-214']
monopoly.:::['1-7-215']
so, uh...:::['1-7-217', '10-17-502', '2-9-311', '2-5-292']
where did, uh, paolo come from?:::['1-7-218']
italy, i think. heh.:::['1-7-219']
no, i mean tonight, in the building? suddenly into our lives?:::['1-7-220']
the cat turned out to be paolo's cat. isn't that funny?:::['1-7-221']
that is funny. and rachel keeps touching him.:::['1-7-222']
i looked all over the building and i couldn't find the kitty anywhere.:::['1-7-223']
oh, i found him. it was paolo's cat.:::['1-7-224']
ah. well, there you go. last to know again.:::['1-7-225']
and i'm guessing, since nobody told me, this is paolo?:::['1-7-226']
oh. paolo, this is phoebe.:::['1-7-227']
you betcha.:::['1-7-228']
blow a bubble. a bubble's good.:::['1-7-229']
it's got a, uh, boyish charm. it's impish.:::['1-7-230']
nice going, imp.:::['1-7-232']
okay. it's okay. all i need to do is......reach over and put it back in my mouth.:::['1-7-233']
good save. we're back on track and i'm......chewing someone else's gum.:::['1-7-234']
this is not my gum.:::['1-7-235']
oh, my god. oh, my god.:::['1-7-236', '3-13-292']
and now you're choking.:::['1-7-237']
are you all right?:::['1-7-238', '1-10-262', '5-8-290', '5-12-111']
oh, my god. you're choking.:::['1-7-239']
better?:::['1-7-240', '1-12-221']
thank you. that was...:::['1-7-242']
that was...:::['1-7-243']
perfection?:::['1-7-244']
what'd he say that was so funny?:::['1-7-245']
i have absolutely no idea.:::['1-7-246']
that's classic.:::['1-7-247']
my god, you guys. what am i doing?:::['1-7-248']
this is so un-me.:::['1-7-249']
if you want, i'll do it.:::['1-7-250']
i know. i just wanna bite his bottom lip.:::['1-7-251']
but i won't.:::['1-7-252']
god. the first time he smiled at me......those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry.:::['1-7-253']
did you rent mopeds?:::['1-7-254']
because i've heard...:::['1-7-255']
oh, it's not about that right now. okay.:::['1-7-256']
i know it's totally superficial, and we have nothing in common......and we don't even speak the same language......but, god.:::['1-7-257']
paolo, hi.:::['1-7-258']
ross. - listen, uh...:::['1-7-259']
listen, um, heh, something you should, uh, know.:::['1-7-260']
rachel and i are...:::['1-7-261']
we're kind of a thing.:::['1-7-262']
thing? - thing. yes, thing.:::['1-7-263']
you have the sex? - no.:::['1-7-264']
no, no. um, technically, the sex is not being had. but that's, uh...:::['1-7-265']
that's not the point.:::['1-7-266', '7-6-256']
the point is that, uh, rachel and i should be, uh...:::['1-7-267']
well, rachel and i should be together.:::['1-7-268']
and if you get in the, uh...:::['1-7-269']
in bed? - no.:::['1-7-270']
ha. no, not where i was going.:::['1-7-271']
if you get in the way of us becoming a thing......then, uh, i would be, well, very sad.:::['1-7-272']
so do you, um?:::['1-7-274']
you do know a little english? - little.:::['1-7-275']
do you know the word crap-weasel?:::['1-7-276']
no? that's funny, you are a huge crap-weasel.:::['1-7-277']
chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this. watch, it's easy.:::['1-7-278']
ready? - mm-hm.:::['1-7-279']
okay? now try it.:::['1-7-280']
you gotta whip it.:::['1-7-281']
look, look. the last candle's about to burn out.:::['1-7-282']
ten, nine, eight, seven......minus 46, minus 47, minus 48...:::['1-7-283']
ross: thank you. monica: thanks.:::['1-7-284']
ross: kind of spooky without any lights.:::['1-7-285']
ross: okay, guys, i have the definitive one.:::['1-7-286']
uh, ross...:::['1-7-287']
this probably isn't the best time to bring it up......but you have to throw a party for monica.:::['1-7-288']
this has been fun. - yes.:::['1-7-289']
yes. thanks for, uh, letting me use your phone......and for saving my life.:::['1-7-290']
well, goodbye, chandler.:::['1-7-291']
i had a great blackout.:::['1-7-292']
hi. um, i'm account number 7143457. and i don't know if you got any of that......but i would really like a copy of the tape.:::['1-7-294']
guys? there's, uh, somebody i'd like you to meet.:::['1-10-0']
wait, wait. what is that?:::['1-10-1']
that would be marcel. you wanna say hi?:::['1-10-2']
no. no, i don't.:::['1-10-3']
oh, he is precious. where did you get him?:::['1-10-4']
my friend bethel rescued him from some lab.:::['1-10-5']
that is so cruel.:::['1-10-6']
why? why would a parent name their child bethel?:::['1-10-7']
hey, that monkey's got a ross on his ass.:::['1-10-8']
ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?:::['1-10-9']
yeah. i mean, it's been kind of quiet since carol left, so...:::['1-10-10']
why don't you just get a roommate?:::['1-10-11']
ah, i don't know. you reach a certain age......having a roommate is just kind of pathe...:::['1-10-12']
uh, sorry, that's "pathet," which is sanskrit for "really cool way to live.":::['1-10-13']
friends s01e10: the one with the monkey:::['1-10-14']
you guys, i'm doing all-new material tonight.:::['1-10-15']
i have 12 new songs about my mother's suicide......and one about a snowman.:::['1-10-16']
might want to open with the snowman.:::['1-10-17']
group: hey, joey. - hey.:::['1-10-18']
ross: hey, joe. - so how'd it go?:::['1-10-19']
ah, i didn't get the job.:::['1-10-20']
how could you not get it? you were santa last year.:::['1-10-21']
i don't know. some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager.:::['1-10-22']
he's not even jolly. it's all political.:::['1-10-23']
so, what are you gonna be?:::['1-10-24']
i'm gonna be one of his helpers.:::['1-10-25']
it's just such a slap in the face, you know?:::['1-10-26']
do you guys know what you're doing for new year's?:::['1-10-27']
gee, what? what is wrong with new year's?:::['1-10-28']
nothing for you. you have paolo.:::['1-10-29']
you don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday......desperate scramble to find anything with lips......just so can have somebody to kiss when the ball drops. man, i'm talking loud.:::['1-10-30']
well, for your information, paolo's gonna be in rome this new year's.:::['1-10-31']
so i'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.:::['1-10-32']
it's just that i'm sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday.:::['1-10-34']
i say this year, no dates, we make a pact.:::['1-10-35']
just the six of us. dinner.:::['1-10-36']
sure. - fine.:::['1-10-37']
you know, i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.:::['1-10-38']
woo! - okay.:::['1-10-39']
phoebe, you're on. - oh. oh, good.:::['1-10-40']
okay, hi. ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand......miss phoebe buffay.:::['1-10-41']
um, ahem, i want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.:::['1-10-43']
i made a man with eyes of coal:::['1-10-44']
and a smile so bewitchin':::['1-10-45']
how was i supposed to know:::['1-10-46']
that my mom was dead in the kitchen?:::['1-10-47']
la-la-la:::['1-10-48']
my mother's ashes:::['1-10-49']
even her eyelashes:::['1-10-50']
are resting in a little yellow jar:::['1-10-51']
and sometimes when it's freezing david: i'm being honest here.:::['1-10-52']
you don't agree.:::['1-10-53']
i feel a little sneezy max: you're right.:::['1-10-54']
and now i... excuse me? excuse me?:::['1-10-55']
yeah, noisy boys.:::['1-10-56']
is it something that you'd like to share with the group?:::['1-10-57']
no. no, that's okay.:::['1-10-58']
come on, if it's important enough to discuss while i'm playing......then i assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear.:::['1-10-59']
that guy's going home with a note.:::['1-10-60']
nothing. i was just saying... - could you speak up?:::['1-10-61']
i was just saying to my friend, you were the most beautiful woman i'd ever seen.:::['1-10-63']
and you said daryl hannah... - darryl hannah.:::['1-10-64']
...was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life.:::['1-10-65']
and i said, yeah, i liked her in splash, but not so much in wall street.:::['1-10-66']
i thought she had a hard quality. - a hard quality.:::['1-10-67']
and, uh, while daryl hannah is beautiful in a conventional way......you are, uh, luminous with a kind of delicate grace.:::['1-10-68']
then that's when you started yelling.:::['1-10-69']
okay, we're gonna take a short break.:::['1-10-70']
i think that guy's going home with more than a note.:::['1-10-71']
ross: come here, marcel. sit here.:::['1-10-72']
pheebs, i can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet.:::['1-10-73']
i mean, god, by my sixth date with paolo......i mean, he had already named both my breasts.:::['1-10-74']
ooh, did i just share too much?:::['1-10-75']
just a smidge.:::['1-10-76']
david's, like, you know, a scientist guy. he's very methodical.:::['1-10-77']
i think it's romantic. - me too. oh!:::['1-10-78']
did you ever see an officer and a gentleman?:::['1-10-79']
well, he's kind of like the guy i went to see that with.:::['1-10-81']
except...:::['1-10-82']
except he's smarter and gentler and sweeter.:::['1-10-83']
i just... i just want to be with him all the time.:::['1-10-84']
you know, day and night. and night and day.:::['1-10-85']
and special occasions.:::['1-10-86']
wait a minute. i see where this is going. you're gonna ask him to new year's.:::['1-10-87']
you're gonna break the pact. she's gonna break the pact.:::['1-10-88']
yeah, could i just?:::['1-10-90']
yeah, because i already asked janice. rachel: you what?:::['1-10-91']
come on, this was a pact. this was your pact.:::['1-10-92']
i snapped, okay? i couldn't handle the pressure and i snapped.:::['1-10-93']
yeah, but janice? that was, like, the worst breakup in history.:::['1-10-94']
i'm not saying it was a good idea. i'm saying i snapped.:::['1-10-95']
hi. hi, sorry i'm late.:::['1-10-96']
too many jokes.:::['1-10-97']
must mock joey.:::['1-10-98']
nice shoes, huh?:::['1-10-99']
aah, you're killing me.:::['1-10-100']
ross. he's playing with my spatulas again.:::['1-10-101']
look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?:::['1-10-102']
do you always have to bring him here?:::['1-10-103']
look, i didn't want to leave him alone, all right?:::['1-10-104']
we had our first fight this morning.:::['1-10-105']
i think it has to do with my working late. i said some things that i didn't mean.:::['1-10-106']
he threw some feces.:::['1-10-107']
you know, if you're gonna work late, i can look in on him for you.:::['1-10-108']
oh, that would be great. okay.:::['1-10-109']
but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay?:::['1-10-110']
and you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me.:::['1-10-111']
okay. but if he asks, i'm not going to lie.:::['1-10-112']
but you can't actually test this theory.:::['1-10-113']
because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough......to simulate these conditions.:::['1-10-114']
okay. all right. i have a question then. - yeah.:::['1-10-115']
were you planning on kissing me ever?:::['1-10-116']
uh, that's definitely a valid question......and, uh, the answer......would be yes.:::['1-10-117']
yes, i was.:::['1-10-118', '5-13-260']
but see, i wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss......that happened at this phenomenal moment because, well, it's you.:::['1-10-119']
sure. yeah.:::['1-10-120', '8-18-1', '7-9-73', '7-15-257']
right. but, see, the longer i waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.:::['1-10-121']
and now, we've reached a place......where it's just got to be one of those things where i......sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.:::['1-10-122']
and i'm not really a sweeping sort of fella.:::['1-10-123']
oh, david, i think you are a sweeping sort of fella.:::['1-10-124']
i mean, you're a sweeper trapped inside a physicist's body.:::['1-10-125']
really. - oh, yeah. i'm sure of it.:::['1-10-126']
you should just do it. just sweep and throw me. heh.:::['1-10-127']
now? now? - right now. just...:::['1-10-128']
okay. okay, okay.:::['1-10-129']
you know what? this is just really expensive.:::['1-10-130']
okay. and i'll tell you, this was a gift.:::['1-10-131']
so now you're just kind of tidying up. - okay, what the hell? what the hell?:::['1-10-132']
you want me to actually throw you...? - i can hop.:::['1-10-133']
now, tell me something, what does the phase "no-date pact" mean to you?:::['1-10-134']
look, i'm sorry, okay?:::['1-10-135', '3-11-312']
it's just that chandler has somebody and phoebe has somebody.:::['1-10-136']
i thought i'd ask fun bobby.:::['1-10-137']
fun bobby, your ex-boyfriend, fun bobby? - yeah.:::['1-10-138']
you know more than one fun bobby?:::['1-10-139']
i happen to know a fun bob.:::['1-10-140']
okay. here we go.:::['1-10-141', '8-15-227', '10-17-435']
whoa, whoa, whoa. there's no room for milk.:::['1-10-142']
there. now there is.:::['1-10-143']
okay, so on our no-date evening......three of you now are gonna have dates.:::['1-10-144']
uh, four. - four.:::['1-10-145']
five. - five.:::['1-10-146']
sorry. paolo's catching an earlier flight.:::['1-10-147']
yeah, and i met this really hot single mom at the store. ha, ha.:::['1-10-148']
what's an elf to do?:::['1-10-149']
okay, so i'm gonna be the only one standing there alone......when the ball drops?:::['1-10-150']
oh, come on. we'll have a big party, and no one will know who's with who.:::['1-10-151']
hey, you know, this is so not what i needed now.:::['1-10-152']
what's the matter? - oh, it's marcel.:::['1-10-153']
he keeps shutting me out, you know?:::['1-10-154']
he's walking around all the time, dragging his hands.:::['1-10-155']
that's so weird. i had such a blast with him the other night.:::['1-10-156']
really? - yeah, we played. we watched tv.:::['1-10-157']
that juggling thing is amazing.:::['1-10-158']
what, uh?:::['1-10-159']
what juggling thing?:::['1-10-160']
with the balled-up socks? i figured you taught him that.:::['1-10-161']
you know, it wasn't that big a deal. i mean, just balled-up socks.:::['1-10-163']
and a melon.:::['1-10-164']
phoebe. hi. - hi, max. do you know everybody?:::['1-10-165']
no. have you seen david?:::['1-10-166']
no, he hasn't been around.:::['1-10-167']
well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. we are going to minsk.:::['1-10-168']
minsk? - minsk. it's in russia.:::['1-10-169']
i know where minsk is.:::['1-10-170']
ha, ha. we got the grant.:::['1-10-171']
three years, all expenses paid.:::['1-10-172']
so when do you leave?:::['1-10-173']
january 1 st.:::['1-10-174']
hey. hi. hi. - hi.:::['1-10-176']
what are you doing here? - um, well, max told me about minsk.:::['1-10-177']
so you know, congratulations. this is so exciting!:::['1-10-178']
max: yeah.:::['1-10-179']
it'd be even more exciting, if we were going.:::['1-10-180']
oh, you're not going? oh, why?:::['1-10-181']
tell her, david.:::['1-10-182']
"i don't want to go to minsk to work with lipson and yamaguchi and flank.:::['1-10-183']

okay, so just because it was my table, i have to buy a new one?:::['1-12-91']
that's the rule.:::['1-12-92']
what rule? there's no rule.:::['1-12-93']
if anything, you owe me a table.:::['1-12-94']
how did you get there?:::['1-12-95']
i believe this piece of furniture was fine......until your little breakfast adventure with angela delveccio.:::['1-12-96']
you knew about that?:::['1-12-97']
the impressions you made in the butter......left little to the imagination.:::['1-12-98']
okay, okay. how about if we split it?:::['1-12-99']
what do you mean, like, buy it together?:::['1-12-100']
do you think we're ready for something like that?:::['1-12-102']
why not? - well, it's just a big commitment.:::['1-12-103']
i mean, what if one of us wants to move out?:::['1-12-104']
why, are you moving out? - i'm not moving out.:::['1-12-105']
you'd tell me if you were moving out, right?:::['1-12-106']
yes, it's just that, with my last roommate...:::['1-12-107']
oh, i know all about kip.:::['1-12-108']
we bought a hibachi together,and then he ran off and got married......and things got pretty ugly.:::['1-12-109']
so let me ask you something.:::['1-12-110']
was kip a better roommate than me?:::['1-12-111']
oh, don't do that.:::['1-12-112']
you've got a couple changes in your schedule.:::['1-12-113']
your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30.:::['1-12-114']

uh, i am, uh......being naked?:::['1-12-124']
um, that's really your decision.:::['1-12-125']
i mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...:::['1-12-126']
ooh, oops! being naked.:::['1-12-127']
i can't believe you don't want to know.:::['1-12-128']
i mean, i could not know.:::['1-12-129']
i mean, if the doctor knows, and carol knows, and susan knows...:::['1-12-130']
and monica knows.:::['1-12-131']
heh. how could you? i don't even know.:::['1-12-132']
carol called to thank me for the lasagna.:::['1-12-133']

so, what's it going to be?:::['1-12-135']

oh, yeah. i'm sure.:::['1-12-156']
and all of a sudden, his hands weren't the problem anymore.:::['1-12-157']

oh, boy scouts could've camped under there.:::['1-12-159']
group: ooh.:::['1-12-160']

oh, yeah, you have to tell her.:::['1-12-167']

so what? like people are gonna come in and think, "uh-oh, i'm outside again.":::['1-12-174']
what about the birds?:::['1-12-176']
i don't know. birds just don't say::::['1-12-177']
"hello, sit here. eat something.":::['1-12-178']
you pick one.:::['1-12-179']
how about the ladybugs?:::['1-12-180']
oh, so forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining?:::['1-12-181']
fine. do you want the birds? get the birds.:::['1-12-182']
not like that, i won't.:::['1-12-183']
kip would've liked the birds.:::['1-12-184']
hey. - hi, pheebs.:::['1-12-185']

one, my friends are the most important thing in my life.:::['1-12-198']
two, i never lie.:::['1-12-199']
and three, i make the best oatmeal-raisin cookies in the world.:::['1-12-200']
okay. thanks, pheebs.:::['1-12-201']
mm, my god.:::['1-12-202']
why have i never tasted these before?:::['1-12-203']
oh, i don't make them a lot......because i don't think it's fair to the other cookies.:::['1-12-204']
ahem, god.:::['1-12-205']
well, you're right. these are the best oatmeal-raisin cookies i've ever had.:::['1-12-206']
which proves that i never lie. - i guess you don't.:::['1-12-207']
paolo made a pass at me.:::['1-12-208']
i think it's the most beautiful table i've ever seen.:::['1-12-210']
so how does this work?:::['1-12-212']

he makes me feel so..." ugh!:::['1-12-226']
i'm so embarrassed.:::['1-12-228', '1-12-229']
i'm the one he hit on.:::['1-12-230']
i unleashed him on you. if i'd never met him......this would've never happened.:::['1-12-231']
i'm so sorry. - no, i'm sorry.:::['1-12-232']
both: no, i'm sorry.:::['1-12-233']
oh, wait. oh.:::['1-12-234']
what are we sorry about? - i don't know.:::['1-12-235']
right. he's the pig.:::['1-12-236']
such a pig. - oh, god, he's such a pig.:::['1-12-237']
oh, he's like a big disgusting pig... - yeah, like a...:::['1-12-238']
pig man. - yes, good. okay.:::['1-12-239']
oh, but he was my pig man.:::['1-12-240']
how did i not see this?:::['1-12-241']
oh, i know!:::['1-12-242']
because......he's gorgeous.:::['1-12-243']
and he's charming.:::['1-12-244']
and when he looks at you... - okay. okay, pheebs.:::['1-12-245']
the end.:::['1-12-246']
ugh. god.:::['1-12-247']
should i not have told you?:::['1-12-248']
no, trust me, it's much better that i know.:::['1-12-249']
uh, i just liked it better before. it was better.:::['1-12-250']
i think she took it pretty well.:::['1-12-251']
you know, paolo's over there right now, so...:::['1-12-252']
yeah, we should get over there and see if she's okay.:::['1-12-253']
just one second.:::['1-12-254']
whoo! score. - game. us.:::['1-12-255']
come on, pheebs.:::['1-12-257']
whoo.:::['1-12-258', '8-7-13', '2-7-180', '3-20-346']
well, it looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.:::['1-12-259']
no, no. she kicked our butts.:::['1-12-260']
you could be on the olympic "standing there" team.:::['1-12-261']
come on. two on one.:::['1-12-262']
what are you still doing here? she just broke up with the guy.:::['1-12-263']
it's time for you to swoop in.:::['1-12-264']
what? now?:::['1-12-265']
yes. now is when you swoop.:::['1-12-266']
you gotta make sure that when paolo walks out......the first guy rachel sees is you.:::['1-12-267']
she's got to know that you're everything he's not.:::['1-12-268']
you're like... like the anti-paolo.:::['1-12-269']
my catholic friend is right.:::['1-12-270']
she's distraught. you're there for her.:::['1-12-271']
you pick up the pieces, and then you usher in::::['1-12-272']
the age of ross.:::['1-12-273']
rachel: see this? see?:::['1-12-274']
how's it going? monica: don't stare.:::['1-12-275']
she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony.:::['1-12-276']
now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving.:::['1-12-277']
okay, that is either, "how could you?" or "enormous breasts.":::['1-12-278']
here he comes.:::['1-12-279', '7-4-305', '5-20-156']
uh, i am, uh......to say goodbye.:::['1-12-280']
oh, okay, bye-bye.:::['1-12-281']
paolo.:::['1-12-282']
i really hate you for what you did to rachel. but i still have five of these......so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.:::['1-12-283']
thanks:::['1-12-284']
paolo, i just wanna tell you......and i think i'd speak for everyone when i say...:::['1-12-285']
phoebe: oh. just look at her.:::['1-12-286']
oh, you guys, i really think only one of us should go out there......so she's not overwhelmed. - oh, right.:::['1-12-287']
and i really think it should be me.:::['1-12-288']
both: hey.:::['1-12-289', '10-4-52', '4-18-77', '4-18-157', '3-21-10', '3-20-31', '3-3-6']
you all right?:::['1-12-290']
oh. i've been better.:::['1-12-291']
listen......you deserve so much better than him.:::['1-12-293']
you know? i mean, you...:::['1-12-294']
you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.:::['1-12-295']
ross...:::['1-12-296', '3-25-278']
i'm so sick of guys.:::['1-12-298']
i don't want to look at another guy.:::['1-12-299']
i don't want to think about another guy.:::['1-12-300']
i don't even want to be near another guy.:::['1-12-301']
ross, you're so great. - oh, ha, ha.:::['1-12-303']
monica: are you all right? phoebe: are you okay?:::['1-12-304']
medium. heh.:::['1-12-305']
any cookies left? - yeah.:::['1-12-306']
heh. see, rach, um...:::['1-12-307']
see, i don't think swearing off guys altogether is the answer. i really don't.:::['1-12-308']
i think what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.:::['1-12-309']
no. no. i just need to be by myself for a while.:::['1-12-310']
you know? i just gotta figure out what i want.:::['1-12-311']
see, because not all guys out there are gonna be a paolo.:::['1-12-313']
no, i know. i know.:::['1-12-314']
and i'm sure your little boy's not gonna grow up to be one.:::['1-12-315']
i'm having a boy?:::['1-12-317']
no. in fact, you're not having a boy.:::['1-12-319']
i'm having a boy.:::['1-12-320']
am i having a boy?:::['1-12-321']
you're having a boy. - aah!:::['1-12-322']
i'm having a boy. i'm having a boy. - yes!:::['1-12-323']
what? - what is it?:::['1-12-324']
i'm having a boy. i'm having a boy.:::['1-12-325']
we already knew that.:::['1-12-327']
i'm having a son.:::['1-12-328']
yes. and that would be a shutdown.:::['1-12-330']
shutout!:::['1-12-331']
where you guys going? come on, one more game.:::['1-12-332']
oh. it's 2:30 in the morning. - yeah. get out.:::['1-12-333']
you guys are always hanging out in my apartment.:::['1-12-334']
come on, i'll only use my left hand, huh?:::['1-12-335']
come on, wussies.:::['1-12-336']
all right. okay. i gotta go. - mm-hm.:::['1-12-337']
i'm going.:::['1-12-338', '2-9-261']
and i'm gone.:::['1-12-339']
one more game? - oh, yeah.:::['1-12-340']
would you let it go? it's not a big deal.:::['1-5-0']
ross: not a big deal? it's amazing.:::['1-5-1']
you just reach in, there's one little maneuver, and bam!:::['1-5-2']
a bra. right out the sleeve.:::['1-5-3']
as far as i'm concerned......there is nothing a guy can do that comes close. right?:::['1-5-4']
come on! you guys can pee standing up.:::['1-5-5']
we can? okay, i'm trying that.:::['1-5-6']
you know what blows my mind?:::['1-5-7']
women can see breasts anytime they want.:::['1-5-8']
you just look down, and there they are.:::['1-5-9']
how you get any work done is beyond me.:::['1-5-10']
what i don't get is the way guys can do so many mean things......and then not even care.:::['1-5-11']
multiple orgasms!:::['1-5-12']
friends s01e05: the one with the east german laundry detergent:::['1-5-13']
so saturday night, the big night.:::['1-5-14']
date night! saturday night. saturday night!:::['1-5-15']
no plans, huh? - not a one.:::['1-5-16']
not even, say, breaking up with janice?:::['1-5-17']
oh, right, right. shut up.:::['1-5-18']
chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone.:::['1-5-19']
you just gotta do it. - i know. but it's just so hard.:::['1-5-20']
you're sitting with her. she has no idea what's happening.:::['1-5-21']
you finally get up the courage to do it.:::['1-5-22']
there's that awkward moment when you've handed her the note.:::['1-5-23']
why do you have to break up with her?:::['1-5-24']
be a man. just stop calling.:::['1-5-25']
if you want, i'll do it with you.:::['1-5-26']
thanks, but she'd feel like we were ganging up on her.:::['1-5-27']
i mean you break up with janice. i'll break up with tony.:::['1-5-28']
you're breaking up with tony?:::['1-5-29']
i know. he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore.:::['1-5-30']
i don't know if it's me or his hunger strike. i don't know.:::['1-5-31']
does anybody want anything else?:::['1-5-32']
yeah. last week you had a wonderful nutty, chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that...:::['1-5-33']
nothing. i'm fine.:::['1-5-34']
what's the matter? why so scrunchie?:::['1-5-35']
it's my father. he wants to give me a mercedes convertible.:::['1-5-36']
that guy, he burns me up.:::['1-5-37']
yeah, well, it's a mercedes if i move back home.:::['1-5-38']
it was horrible! he called me "young lady.":::['1-5-39']
ooh, i hate when my father calls me that.:::['1-5-40']
did he give you that whole "you're not up to this" thing again?:::['1-5-41']
yeah, i got the extended disco version with three choruses of::::['1-5-42']
"you'll never make it on your own.":::['1-5-43']
uh-huh, uh-huh:::['1-5-44']
hi, joey.:::['1-5-45', '7-19-108']
oh, my god. angela.:::['1-5-46']
wow. being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.:::['1-5-47']
are you gonna go over there? - no.:::['1-5-48']
yeah. no.:::['1-5-49']
okay, but not yet. i don't wanna seem too eager.:::['1-5-50']
one mississippi, two mississippi......three mississippi. that seems pretty cool.:::['1-5-51']
hey, angela.:::['1-5-52']
you look good.:::['1-5-54', '5-14-266']
because i'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.:::['1-5-55']
you don't say.:::['1-5-56']
so, rachel, what are you doing tonight?:::['1-5-57']
big glamour night. me and monica at launderama.:::['1-5-58']
you wanna hear a freakish coincidence?:::['1-5-60']
guess who's doing laundry there too?:::['1-5-61']
who? - me.:::['1-5-62']
was that not clear?:::['1-5-63']
hey, why don't...?:::['1-5-64']
why don't i just join you both there?:::['1-5-65']
don't you have a laundry room in your building?:::['1-5-66']
i do have a laundry room in my building.:::['1-5-68']
um... but there's a rat problem.:::['1-5-69']
apparently, they're attracted to the dryer sheets.:::['1-5-70']
they're going in fine, but they're coming out all......fluffy.:::['1-5-71']
anyway, 7-ish?:::['1-5-72']
forget it, joey. i'm with bob now.:::['1-5-74']
bob? who the hell's bob?:::['1-5-75']
bob is great.:::['1-5-76']
he's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job.:::['1-5-77']
you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor. but bob...:::['1-5-78']
come on. we were great together.:::['1-5-79']
and not just at the fun stuff, but, like, talking too.:::['1-5-80']
sorry, joey. you said, "let's just be friends.":::['1-5-81']
so guess what?:::['1-5-82']
what? - we're just friends.:::['1-5-83']
so why don't the four of us go out and have dinner tonight? you know, as friends.:::['1-5-85']
what "four of us"?:::['1-5-86']
you and bob, and me and my girlfriend, um......monica.:::['1-5-87']
joey: monica, i'm telling you, this guy is perfect for you.:::['1-5-88']
forget it! not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.:::['1-5-89']
come on, this guy's great. his name's bob. he's angela's......ahem, brother.:::['1-5-90']
he's smart, he's sophisticated......and he has a real job.:::['1-5-91']
me, i go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but bob is...:::['1-5-92']
oh, god, help us. - what?:::['1-5-93']
ugly naked guy is laying kitchen tile.:::['1-5-94']
both: ew!:::['1-5-95']
look, i'm asking a favor here.:::['1-5-96']
i'm thinking if i do this for her brother......maybe angela will come back to me.:::['1-5-97']
what's going on here? you go out with tons of girls.:::['1-5-98']
i know, but...:::['1-5-99']
look, i made a huge mistake. i never should've broke up with her.:::['1-5-100']
will you help me? please?:::['1-5-101']
monica's not coming. it's just gonna be me and rachel.:::['1-5-103']
hold on there, camper. you sure you've thought this through?:::['1-5-104']
it's laundry. the thinking through is pretty minimal.:::['1-5-105']
it's just you and rachel? just the two of you?:::['1-5-106']
this is a date. you're going on a date.:::['1-5-107']
yeah-huh.:::['1-5-109']
what are you saying?:::['1-5-110', '9-9-244', '10-15-121']
i should shave again? pick up some wine? what?:::['1-5-111']
well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear.:::['1-5-112']
it's the first time she'll see your underwear. you want it to be dirty?:::['1-5-113']
and the fabric softener?:::['1-5-115']
okay, okay. now, what is wrong with my snuggles?:::['1-5-116']
what? it says i'm a sensitive, warm kind of guy.:::['1-5-117']
you know, like a little fuzzy bear.:::['1-5-118']
i can pick something else up on the way.:::['1-5-119']
monica: thank you.:::['1-5-120']
so what does this bob guy look like? is he tall, short?:::['1-5-121']
yep.:::['1-5-122', '7-18-244', '7-14-153', '7-16-296', '10-5-143', '5-20-63', '3-22-163']
which?:::['1-5-123']
which what?:::['1-5-124']
you've never met bob, have you?:::['1-5-125']
no, but...:::['1-5-126']
for all we know, he could be horribly...:::['1-5-127']
hey, joey:::['1-5-128']
horribly attractive. i'll be shutting up now.:::['1-5-129']
where are they? where are they?:::['1-5-130']
this is nice. we never do anything, just the two of us.:::['1-5-131']
that's great. maybe tomorrow we can rent a car, run over some puppies.:::['1-5-132']
ew. i don't wanna do that.:::['1-5-133']
here we go. - have a good breakup.:::['1-5-134']
hey, janice. - my god, i am so glad you called me.:::['1-5-135']
i had the most supremely awful day.:::['1-5-136']
that's not good.:::['1-5-137', '5-19-162']
can i get an espresso and a latte over here, please?:::['1-5-138']
we got the proofs from that photo shoot with the vegetables.:::['1-5-139']
they sucked.:::['1-5-140']
i blew off the rest of the afternoon. i went shopping.:::['1-5-141']
and i got you...:::['1-5-142']
janice: i'm looking. i'm looking.:::['1-5-143']
i'm looking.:::['1-5-144']
i got you... - what?:::['1-5-145']
what? - what did you get me there?:::['1-5-146']
i got you......these.:::['1-5-147']
bullwinkle socks.:::['1-5-148']
that's so sweet. - i knew you had the rockys.:::['1-5-149']
so you could wear bullwinkle and bullwinkle......or wear rocky and rocky, or you can mix and match.:::['1-5-150']
moose and squirrel.:::['1-5-151']
whatever you want.:::['1-5-152']
i'm gonna get another espresso. more latte?:::['1-5-153']
no, i'm still working on mine.:::['1-5-155']
that's it?:::['1-5-156', '10-9-99', '5-18-192', '5-10-152']
yeah, it was really hard.:::['1-5-157']
yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.:::['1-5-158']
okay, you weren't there.:::['1-5-159']
woman: coming through! move! move!:::['1-5-160']
excuse me! i was kind of using that machine.:::['1-5-161']
yeah, well, now you're kind of not.:::['1-5-162']
but i saved it. i put my basket on top.:::['1-5-163']
i'm sorry. is that your basket? - yes.:::['1-5-164']
it's really pretty. unfortunately, i don't see suds!:::['1-5-165']
no suds, no save, okay?:::['1-5-167']
what's going on? - hi.:::['1-5-168']
nothing. this horrible woman just took my machine.:::['1-5-169']
was your basket on top?:::['1-5-170']
yeah, but there were no suds. - so?:::['1-5-171']
you know, no suds, no save.:::['1-5-172']
no suds, no... excuse me.:::['1-5-173']
hold on a second!:::['1-5-174']
this is my friend's machine.:::['1-5-175']
hey, hey, hey! her stuff wasn't in it!:::['1-5-176']
hey, hey, hey! that's not the rule, and you know it!:::['1-5-177']
all right. show's over.:::['1-5-178']
nothing to see here.:::['1-5-179']
okay. let's do laundry.:::['1-5-180']
that was amazing! i can't even send back soup.:::['1-5-181']
well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle...:::['1-5-182']
do you, uh?:::['1-5-183']
oh, hey. you must need detergent.:::['1-5-184']
what's that? - überweiss.:::['1-5-185']
it's new. it's german. it's extra tough!:::['1-5-186']
rach, do you...? are you gonna separate those?:::['1-5-187']
oh, god. ugh.:::['1-5-188']
am i being like a total laundry spaz?:::['1-5-189']
am i supposed to use one machine for shirts and another for pants?:::['1-5-190']
have you...? have you never done this before?:::['1-5-191']
well, not myself. but i know other people that have.:::['1-5-192']
okay. you caught me. i'm a laundry virgin.:::['1-5-193']
don't worry. i'll use the gentle cycle.:::['1-5-194']
basically, you wanna use one machine for all your whites.:::['1-5-196']
whites. okay.:::['1-5-197']
a whole other machine for your colors. - colors.:::['1-5-198']
and then a third for your, uh......delicates. and that would be your bras......and your underpanty things.:::['1-5-199']
okay, well, these are white cotton panties.:::['1-5-200']
would they go with whites or with delicates?:::['1-5-201']
that would be a judgment call.:::['1-5-202']
he's so cute!:::['1-5-203']
so where did you guys grow up?:::['1-5-204']
brooklyn heights. - cleveland.:::['1-5-205']
ha. heh, heh, heh.:::['1-5-206']
how did that happen? - oh, my god!:::['1-5-207']
i suddenly had the feeling i was......falling.:::['1-5-209']
so you and angela, huh?:::['1-5-211']
yep. pretty much.:::['1-5-212']
you're a lucky man. - yeah.:::['1-5-213']
you know what i miss the most about her?:::['1-5-214']
that cute nibbley noise she makes when she eats.:::['1-5-215']
like a happy little squirrel......or a weasel.:::['1-5-216']
i never really noticed.:::['1-5-217']
oh, yeah, yeah. listen for it.:::['1-5-218']
monica. monica is great.:::['1-5-219']
yeah. yeah, she is.:::['1-5-220']
but it's not gonna last.:::['1-5-221']
she's too much for me in bed.:::['1-5-222']
sexually.:::['1-5-223']
i've gotta tell you, bob is terrific.:::['1-5-224']
yeah, isn't he?:::['1-5-225']
it's so great to meet a guy who's smart and funny......and has an emotional age beyond 8.:::['1-5-226']
you know what else? he's unbelievable in bed!:::['1-5-227']
my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.:::['1-5-229']
that's nice.:::['1-5-231']
you can do this. it's like pulling off a band-aid.:::['1-5-232']
just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.:::['1-5-233']
go! go!:::['1-5-234']
janice...:::['1-5-235']
hi, janice.:::['1-5-236', '3-4-316']
okay, here we go. i don't think we should go out anymore.:::['1-5-237']
well, there you go.:::['1-5-241', '8-1-261', '10-10-334', '2-16-285', '2-3-115', '2-23-126', '5-20-332', '3-17-51']
stop it, stop it, stop it.:::['1-5-242']
rachel: okay, i know this is gonna sound really stupid......but i feel that if i can do this......if i can actually do my own laundry......there isn't anything i can't do.:::['1-5-243']
that does not sound stupid to me.:::['1-5-244']
no, it's like... the first time i had to make dinner for myself after carol left me...:::['1-5-245']
i'm sorry, that's all the time we have. next on ross...:::['1-5-246']
uh-oh. - what, "uh-oh"?:::['1-5-248']
uh-oh...:::['1-5-249']
uh-oh, the laundry's done.:::['1-5-250']
it's a song.:::['1-5-251']
the laundry song that we sing.:::['1-5-252']
uh-oh, the laundry's done:::['1-5-253']
nothing. nothing.:::['1-5-255', '4-20-131', '4-2-74', '3-16-179']
the laundry's done:::['1-5-256']
come on, show me.:::['1-5-257']
it's just that you left a red sock in with your whites, and now......everything's kind of pink. - oh.:::['1-5-258']
everything's pink?:::['1-5-259']
except for the red sock, which is still red.:::['1-5-260']
don't be upset. it can happen to anyone.:::['1-5-261']
but it didn't. it happened to me.:::['1-5-262']

something went wrong with underdog......and they couldn't get his head to inflate.:::['1-5-267']
so anyway......his head is, like, flopping down broadway.:::['1-5-268']
and i'm thinking......how inappropriate this is.:::['1-5-269']
i've got something's in my eye. joey, could we check it in the light, please?:::['1-5-270']
oh, my god! - what?:::['1-5-271']

come on, they're close. - close? she's got her tongue in his ear.:::['1-5-273']
like you've never got a little rambunctious with ross.:::['1-5-274']
joey, this is sick. it's disgusting. it's......not really true, is it?:::['1-5-275']

monica: i'm so sorry. i can't believe i did this.:::['1-5-286']
i just couldn't stop laughing at your norman mailer story.:::['1-5-287']

you were incredible.:::['1-5-323']
a brand-new woman, ladies and gentlemen.:::['1-5-324', '4-21-83']
i could not have done this without you.:::['1-5-325']
ross: okay, um...:::['1-5-326']

what a beautiful story.:::['1-5-336']
i'm fine, by the way.:::['1-5-337']
where's chandler? - he needed some time to grieve.:::['1-5-339']
chandler: i'm free! i'm free!:::['1-5-340']
that ought to do it.:::['1-5-341']
phoebe: oh, that's good.:::['1-4-0']
okay. all right, phoebe? - okay, okay.:::['1-4-1']
if i were omnipotent for a day, i would want, um, world peace......no more hunger, good things for the rain forest.:::['1-4-2']
and bigger boobs.:::['1-4-3']
well, see, you took mine, so...:::['1-4-4']
chandler, what about you?:::['1-4-5']
if i were omnipotent for a day, i'd make myself omnipotent forever.:::['1-4-6']
heh. see, there's always one guy.:::['1-4-7']
"if i had a wish, i'd wish for three more wishes.":::['1-4-8']
ross & monica: hey, joey. - hey, buddy.:::['1-4-9']

hey, if little joey's dead, then i got no reason to live, you know?:::['1-4-13']
joey, uh, omnipotent.:::['1-4-14']

oh. - what's going on with you?:::['1-4-24']

my grandmother has this new boyfriend......and they're both kind of insecure in bed, so...:::['1-4-26']
and deaf.:::['1-4-27']
so they're constantly having to reassure each other that they're having a good time.:::['1-4-28']
you have no idea how loud they are.:::['1-4-29']
you can stay with rachel and me tonight. - thanks.:::['1-4-30']

ooh, ooh. and i brought operation.:::['1-4-131']

rach, it's the visa-card people.:::['1-4-134']
oh, god. ask them what they want.:::['1-4-135']
could you please tell me what this is in reference to?:::['1-4-136']
yes, hold on.:::['1-4-137']
um, they say there's been unusual activity on your account.:::['1-4-138']
but i haven't used my card in weeks. - that is the unusual activity.:::['1-4-139']
they just wanna see if you're okay.:::['1-4-140']
they wanna know if i'm okay?:::['1-4-141']
okay, they wanna know if i'm okay. okay, let's see.:::['1-4-142']

it was the first frost.:::['1-4-156']
we were... - sit. just sit down. sit.:::['1-4-157']
you should feel great.:::['1-4-158']
you're doing this amazing independent thing.:::['1-4-159']
monica, what is so amazing?:::['1-4-160']
i gave up like everything. and for what?:::['1-4-161']
you are just like jack.:::['1-4-162']
jack from downstairs?:::['1-4-163']
no, jack and the beanstalk.:::['1-4-164']
ah, the other jack. - yeah, right.:::['1-4-165']
see, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans.:::['1-4-166']
and then he woke up and there was this big plant......outside of his window, full of possibilities and stuff.:::['1-4-167']
and he lived in a village, and you live in the village.:::['1-4-168']
okay, but, pheebs, pheebs, jack gave up a cow.:::['1-4-169']
i gave up an orthodontist.:::['1-4-170']
okay, i know i didn't love him, but...:::['1-4-171']
oh, see, jack did love the cow.:::['1-4-172']
but, see, it was a plan, you know? it was clear.:::['1-4-173']
everything was figured out, and now everything's just kind of like...:::['1-4-174']
flupie? - yeah.:::['1-4-175']
you're not the only one. we don't know where we're going.:::['1-4-176']
you gotta figure, at some point, it's gonna come together......and it's just gonna be "unflupie.":::['1-4-177']
yeah, like that's a word.:::['1-4-178']
okay, but, monica, what if it doesn't come together?:::['1-4-179']
pheebs?:::['1-4-180', '9-5-60', '5-22-178', '4-2-305']
well, because you just... i don't like this question.:::['1-4-181']
okay, see? see, you guys? what if we don't get magic beans?:::['1-4-182']
i mean, what if all we've got are......beans?:::['1-4-183']
get him! get him! get him!:::['1-4-184']

chandler: he's open, he's open. shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!:::['1-4-188']

well, i'm not completely satisfied.:::['1-4-194']
listen, it's kind of an emergency.:::['1-4-195']
i guess you'd know that, or we'd be in the predicament room.:::['1-4-196']
hold on. fill these out. sit over there.:::['1-4-197']
ross: look, i don't wanna make any trouble, okay?:::['1-4-198']
but i'm in a lot of pain here, all right? my face is dented.:::['1-4-199']
well, you'll have to wait your turn. - well, how long do you think it'll be?:::['1-4-200']

and then when you do, he's a preppy animal.:::['1-4-256']
i remember the moonlight coming in through the open window......and her face had the most incredible glow.:::['1-4-258']
yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling.:::['1-4-259']
you did this part.:::['1-4-260']

it's just a little more complicated than that.:::['1-4-265']
what? what is it? that she left you? that she likes women?:::['1-4-266']
that she left you for a woman that likes women?:::['1-4-267']

okay, okay, okay, i got one.:::['1-4-291']

the valentine tommy rollerson left in your locker was really from me.:::['1-4-293']
oh, hello? like he was really gonna send you one.:::['1-4-295']
she was a big girl.:::['1-4-296']

i was laughing. you made me laugh.:::['1-4-299']
oh, my god. there he is. there he is. there he is.:::['1-4-300']

monica: please drop the towel. drop it.:::['1-4-304']
all: wow.:::['1-4-305', '2-4-73']
man, can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?:::['1-4-306']
i think it's great.:::['1-4-307']
you know, it's sweet. it's romantic.:::['1-4-308']
no, are you kidding? the guy's a freak. i judge him.:::['1-4-310']
hey, man. - hey, buddy.:::['1-4-311']
ross: ah? ah?:::['1-4-312']
that's attractive.:::['1-4-314']
oh, i thought you were great in silence of the lambs.:::['1-4-315']
oh, come on, admit it, all things considered, you had fun tonight.:::['1-4-316']
fun? where was the fun?:::['1-4-317']
tell me specifically, which part was the fun part?:::['1-4-318']
where's my puck?:::['1-4-319']
oh. the kid has it. - the kid?:::['1-4-320']
ahem. excuse me, uh, that's my puck.:::['1-4-321']
i found it. finders keepers, losers weepers.:::['1-4-322']
you gotta do it, man.:::['1-4-323']
oh, yeah? well, i'm rubber, you're glue. whatever you...:::['1-4-324']
i can't do it.:::['1-4-325', '10-17-436', '3-21-94']
listen, uh, give me back my puck. - no.:::['1-4-326']
yes, how about? - no.:::['1-4-327']
no, come here. just give me my puck. - no, no, no.:::['1-4-328']
sizemore: hey, no roughhousing in my er.:::['1-4-329']
give me my puck! unh.:::['1-4-330']
now, that was fun.:::['1-4-331']
ross: okay, monica.:::['1-4-332']
right foot, red.:::['1-4-333']
could've played monopoly, but no.:::['1-4-334']
okay, pheebs. right hand, blue.:::['1-4-336']
good. joey: hmm?:::['1-4-337']
oh. rachel, it's the visa-card people. rachel: oh, okay. will you take my place?:::['1-4-339']
all right. yes, this is rachel.:::['1-4-340']
rachel: no. - oh.:::['1-4-341']
oh, yeah. no, i know. i haven't been using it much.:::['1-4-343']
oh, well, thanks, but i'm okay, really.:::['1-4-344']
to the green, to the green.:::['1-4-345']
monica: oh, no. - to the green.:::['1-4-346']
i've got magic beans.:::['1-4-347']
no, no, never mind.:::['1-4-348']
chandler: to the left. to the left.:::['1-4-349']
chandler: i'm sorry. rachel: oh, my god. that's it.:::['1-13-0']
you just barge in here and you don't knock?:::['1-13-1']
you have no respect for anybody's privacy.:::['1-13-2']
rachel, wait. - no, you wait.:::['1-13-3']
can i just say one thing? - what? what?:::['1-13-4']
that's a relatively open weave and i can still see your......nippular area. - ugh!:::['1-13-5']
friends s01e13: the one with the boobies:::['1-13-6']
honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient......who thinks things are other things.:::['1-13-7']
like when the phone rings and she takes a shower...:::['1-13-9']
that's pretty much it.:::['1-13-10']
but you tell it really well, sweetie.:::['1-13-11']
thanks. okay.:::['1-13-12']
now go away so we can talk about you.:::['1-13-13']
okay. i'll miss you.:::['1-13-14']
isn't he great?:::['1-13-15']
he's so cute. and he likes you so much.:::['1-13-16']
he's so sweet. and so complicated, you know?:::['1-13-18']
and for a shrink, he's not too "shrinky." you know?:::['1-13-19']
so you think you'll do it on his couch?:::['1-13-20']
oh. i don't know. that's a little weird.:::['1-13-21']
it's vinyl.:::['1-13-22']
okay. you guys want anything else? - oh, yes.:::['1-13-23']
could i have...? - sorry, we're all out.:::['1-13-24']
anybody else? - okay.:::['1-13-25']
did i, uh, miss something?:::['1-13-26']
no, she's still upset because i saw her boobies.:::['1-13-27']
what were you doing seeing her boobies?:::['1-13-28']
it was an accident.:::['1-13-29', '2-21-258']
i wasn't across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts.:::['1-13-30']
can we change the subject, please?:::['1-13-31']
because, hello? these aren't her "boobies." these are her breasts.:::['1-13-32']
pheebs, i was hoping for more of a change.:::['1-13-33']
i don't know why you're embarrassed. they were very nice boobies.:::['1-13-34']
"nice"?:::['1-13-35']
they were "nice"?:::['1-13-36']
that's it? i mean, mittens are "nice.":::['1-13-37']
okay. rock, hard place......me.:::['1-13-38']
you're so funny.:::['1-13-39', '3-20-114']
he's really funny.:::['1-13-40']
i wouldn't want to be there when the laughter stops.:::['1-13-41']
whoa, whoa. back up there, sparky.:::['1-13-42']
what did you mean by that?:::['1-13-43']
it seems that maybe you have intimacy issues......that you use your humor to keep people at a distance.:::['1-13-44']
i mean, hey, i just met you. i don't know you from adam.:::['1-13-46']
only child, right?:::['1-13-47']
parents divorced before you hit puberty.:::['1-13-48']
uh-huh. how did you know?:::['1-13-49']
it's textbook.:::['1-13-50']
hey, you guys.:::['1-13-51', '7-21-253', '2-14-217', '5-12-163']
you all know my dad, right?:::['1-13-52']
how long are you in the city? - a couple of days.:::['1-13-53']
i got a job midtown.:::['1-13-54']
i figure i'm better off staying with the kid......than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.:::['1-13-55']
i don't know this one.:::['1-13-56']
oh. this is my friend roger. - hi.:::['1-13-57']
good to meet you. roger: you too.:::['1-13-58']
what happened to the, uh, puppet guy?:::['1-13-59']
dad, uh... - oh, oh.:::['1-13-60']
so, ross, uh, how's the wife?:::['1-13-62']
oh for two, huh? heh.:::['1-13-63']
uh, chandler, quick, say something funny.:::['1-13-64']
gotta go. ha, ha. i miss you too.:::['1-13-65']
i love you, but it's getting late now...:::['1-13-66']
let me say hi. hey, ma.:::['1-13-67']
listen, i made the appointment with dr. bassida and...:::['1-13-68']
did you know this isn't ma?:::['1-13-70']
her name's ronni.:::['1-13-71']
she's a pet mortician.:::['1-13-72']
so how long have you been...:::['1-13-74']
remember when you were a kid, i'd take you to the navy yard......and show you the big ships?:::['1-13-75']
since then? - no, it's only been six years.:::['1-13-76']
i wanted to give you a nice memory......so you'd know i wasn't always such a terrible guy.:::['1-13-77']
joe, have you ever been in love?:::['1-13-78']
then you haven't.:::['1-13-80']
you're burning your tomatoes. - hmm. you're one to talk.:::['1-13-81']
joe, your dad's in love, bigtime.:::['1-13-82']
and the worst part is, it's with two different women.:::['1-13-83']
oh, man. please tell me one of them is ma.:::['1-13-84']
of course one of them's ma. what's the matter with you?:::['1-13-85']
it's like if you woke up one day and found out......your dad was leading this double life.:::['1-13-86']
he's, like, actually some spy working for the cia.:::['1-13-87']
that'd be cool.:::['1-13-88']
this blows.:::['1-13-89']
i know. why can't parents just stay parents?:::['1-13-90']
why do they have to become people?:::['1-13-91']
why do they have...?:::['1-13-92']
why......can't you stop staring at my breasts?:::['1-13-93']
didn't you get a good enough look the other day?:::['1-13-96']
all right, we're all adults here.:::['1-13-97']
there's only one way to resolve this.:::['1-13-98']
since you saw her boobies......i think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee.:::['1-13-99']
you know, i don't see that happening.:::['1-13-100']
come on. he's right. tit for tat.:::['1-13-101']
well i'm not showing you my tat.:::['1-13-102']
phoebe: it's phoebe. roger: and rog.:::['1-13-104']
oh, good. rog is here.:::['1-13-106']
what's the matter with rog? - nothing. it's a little thing.:::['1-13-107']
i hate that guy.:::['1-13-108', '1-13-137']
what? so he was a little analytical. that's what he does.:::['1-13-109']
come on, he's not that bad.:::['1-13-110']
that's where you're wrong. why would i marry her......if i thought on any level that she was a lesbian?:::['1-13-111']
maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.:::['1-13-113']
ha, ha. - why? why would i? why?:::['1-13-114']
why? why? why?:::['1-13-115', '3-1-244']
i don't know. maybe low self-esteem?:::['1-13-116']
maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling. maybe...:::['1-13-117']
wait. go back to that "sibling" thing.:::['1-13-118']
well, i don't know.:::['1-13-119']
it's conceivable that you sabotaged your marriage......so the sibling would be less of a failure in the parents' eyes.:::['1-13-120']
that's ridiculous. i don't feel guilty for her failures.:::['1-13-121']
oh, so you think i'm a failure? - isn't he good?:::['1-13-122']
yeah. no. that's not what i was saying.:::['1-13-123']
all these years, i thought you were on my side......but maybe you were sucking up to mom and dad......so they'd favor you.:::['1-13-124']
hey, i married a lesbian to make you look good.:::['1-13-125']
i mean, you're right.:::['1-13-127']
it wasn't just the weebles, but it was the weeble play palace......and the weeble's cruise ship......which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in.:::['1-13-128']
that's tough, tough stuff.:::['1-13-129']
pheebs, if we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta go.:::['1-13-130']
okay. feel better, okay?:::['1-13-131']
roger: we're gonna be late, sweetie. - okay.:::['1-13-132']
listen, thanks for everything, mon. - no problem.:::['1-13-133']
it was great seeing you again.:::['1-13-134']
mon, uh, easy on those cookies, okay?:::['1-13-135']
remember, they're just food......they're not love.:::['1-13-136']
joey: good night, you guys.:::['1-13-138']
oh, look. it's the woman we ordered.:::['1-13-139']
hey. can, uh... can we help you?:::['1-13-140']
oh. no, thanks. i'm just waiting for, uh, joey tribbiani.:::['1-13-141']
oh. oh, no, not you. big joey.:::['1-13-143']
you're so much cuter than your pictures.:::['1-13-145']
i'm ronni.:::['1-13-146']
cheese nip?:::['1-13-147']
uh, joey's having an embolism......but i'd go for a nip.:::['1-13-148']
you see, most people, when their pets pass on......they want them laid out like they're sleeping.:::['1-13-149']
but occasionally you get a person who wants them in a pose.:::['1-13-150']
like, uh, chasing their tail.:::['1-13-151']
or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee.:::['1-13-152']
joey, if i go first, i want to be looking for my keys.:::['1-13-153']
that's a good one. - hey, joe.:::['1-13-154']
hey, dad. ronni's here.:::['1-13-155']
huh? - hi.:::['1-13-156']
hello, babe.:::['1-13-158']
what are...? what are you doing here?:::['1-13-159']
oh, uh, you left your hair at my apartment.:::['1-13-160']
i figured you'd need it for your meeting.:::['1-13-161']
thank you. uh...:::['1-13-162']
so who's up for a big game of kerplunk?:::['1-13-163']
look, i, uh...:::['1-13-164']
i shouldn't have come.:::['1-13-165']
i gotta go. i'll miss the last train.:::['1-13-166']
no, i don't want you taking that thing this late.:::['1-13-167']
where am i gonna stay? here? - whoa.:::['1-13-168']
we'll go to a hotel.:::['1-13-169', '1-13-170']
no, you won't. - no, we won't.:::['1-13-171']
if you go to a hotel, you'll be doing stuff.:::['1-13-172']
i want you right here, where i can keep an eye on you.:::['1-13-173']
you're gonna keep an eye on us?:::['1-13-174']
that's right, mister.:::['1-13-175']
i don't care how old you are, while you're here......you're gonna live by my rules.:::['1-13-176']
and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.:::['1-13-177']
wow, he's strict.:::['1-13-178']
dad, you'll be in my room.:::['1-13-179']
ronni, uh, you can stay in chandler's room.:::['1-13-180']
thanks. you're a good kid.:::['1-13-181']
come on. i'll show you to my room.:::['1-13-182']
that sounds weird when it's not followed by, "no, thanks, it's late.":::['1-13-183']
okay. this is just for tonight. starting tomorrow, you gotta change.:::['1-13-184']
six years is long enough. - what kind of change?:::['1-13-185']
break up with ronni... - i can't.:::['1-13-186']
then come clean with ma. this is not right.:::['1-13-187']
i don't wanna hear it. now go to my room.:::['1-13-188']
hey, kickie.:::['1-13-189']
what are you doing? - trying to get comfortable.:::['1-13-190']
i can't sleep in my underwear. - well, you're gonna.:::['1-13-191']
i've been thinking......about how i'm always seeing girls on top of girls.:::['1-13-192']
are they end-to-end, or tall, like pancakes?:::['1-13-193']
you know what i mean. how i date all these women.:::['1-13-194']
i always figured, when the right one comes along......i'll be able to be a standup guy and go the distance, you know?:::['1-13-195']
now i'm looking at my dad thinking...:::['1-13-196']
you're not him, you're you.:::['1-13-197']
when they wanted you to go into your father's business, did you cave?:::['1-13-198']
you decided to go into the out-of-work-actor business.:::['1-13-200']
that wasn't easy, but you did it.:::['1-13-201']
and i believe that when the right woman comes along......you'll have the guts to say::::['1-13-202']
"no thanks, i'm married.":::['1-13-203']
you really think so?:::['1-13-204', '10-15-304']
yeah. i really do.:::['1-13-205']
thanks, chandler. - get off.:::['1-13-206']
uh, joey said i could use your shower since, uh, chandler's in ours.:::['1-13-209']
okay. who are you?:::['1-13-210']
oh, uh, i'm ronni. ronni rapalono. - uh-huh.:::['1-13-211']
the mistress?:::['1-13-212']
um, come on in. - thanks.:::['1-13-213']
hi, i'm rachel. bathroom's up there.:::['1-13-214']
hey, ronni.:::['1-13-215']
how long has chandler been in the shower?:::['1-13-216']
oh. like, uh, five minutes.:::['1-13-217']
perfect.:::['1-13-218']
fasten your seat belts......it's pee-pee time.:::['1-13-219']
hey, mr. trib.:::['1-13-220']
hey. good morning, dear.:::['1-13-221']
chandler bing, it's time to see your thing.:::['1-13-222']
what's the matter with you? - i thought it was chandler.:::['1-13-223']
you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing.:::['1-13-224']
sorry, my thing was in there with me.:::['1-13-225']
phoebe: hey. all: hey, pheebs.:::['1-13-226']
monica: how's it going? - good. oh, oh.:::['1-13-227']
roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.:::['1-13-228']
so, what's going on? - nothing.:::['1-13-229']
it's just that, uh...:::['1-13-230']
it's roger.:::['1-13-231']
um, ahem, i don't know. there's something about... ahem.:::['1-13-232']
basically, we just feel that he's, uh...:::['1-13-233']
we hate that guy.:::['1-13-234']
monica: we hate him.:::['1-13-235']
we're sorry, pheebs.:::['1-13-236']
uh-huh. okay.:::['1-13-237', '3-22-40']
don't you think maybe it's just that he's so perceptive......that it freaked you out?:::['1-13-238']
no, i hate him. - no, we hate him.:::['1-13-239']
ma. what are you doing here?:::['1-13-241']
i came to give you this......and this. - ow.:::['1-13-242']
big ring.:::['1-13-243']
why did you fill your father's head with that garbage......about making things right?:::['1-13-244']
things were fine the way they were.:::['1-13-245']
there's chicken in there. put it away.:::['1-13-246']
for god's sake, joey. really.:::['1-13-247']
hold on. you knew?:::['1-13-248']
of course i knew. what do you think?:::['1-13-249']
your father is no james bond.:::['1-13-250']
you should have heard his cover stories.:::['1-13-251']
"i'm sleeping over at my accountant's.":::['1-13-252']
i mean, what is that? please.:::['1-13-253']
so then, how could you...?:::['1-13-254']
do you remember how your father used to be?:::['1-13-255']
always yelling. nothing made him happy.:::['1-13-256']
not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle.:::['1-13-257']
now he's happy.:::['1-13-258']
i mean, it's nice. he has a hobby.:::['1-13-259']
ma, i don't mean to be disrespectful, but......what the hell are you talking about?:::['1-13-260']
i mean, what about you? - me? i'm fine.:::['1-13-261']
look, honey......in an ideal world......there'd be no her and your father would look like sting.:::['1-13-262']
and i'll tell you something else::::['1-13-263']
ever since that poodle-stuffer came along......he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive.:::['1-13-264']
he's been more loving.:::['1-13-265']
it's like every day is our anniversary.:::['1-13-266']
i'm happy for you?:::['1-13-267']
well, don't be.:::['1-13-268']
because now everything's screwed up.:::['1-13-269']
i just want it the way it was.:::['1-13-270']
joey: ma, i'm sorry.:::['1-13-271']
i just did what i thought you'd want.:::['1-13-272']
i know you did, cookie. oh, i know you did.:::['1-13-273']
so tell me...:::['1-13-274']
did you see her?:::['1-13-275']
you're 10 times prettier than she is.:::['1-13-277']
could i take her?:::['1-13-279']
with this ring, no contest.:::['1-13-280']
roger: what's wrong, sweetie? phoebe: nothing.:::['1-13-281']
no, no. what's wrong? come on.:::['1-13-282']
it's nothing. i'm fine.:::['1-13-284']
it's just, um... it's my friends.:::['1-13-285']
they have a liking problem with you......in that, um......they don't.:::['1-13-286']
oh. they don't?:::['1-13-287']
but you know......they don't see all of the wonderfulness that i see.:::['1-13-288']
they don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff.:::['1-13-289']
they think you're a little...:::['1-13-290']
what? - intense and creepy.:::['1-13-291']
but i don't. me. phoebe.:::['1-13-293']
well, i'm not at all surprised they feel that way.:::['1-13-294']
you're not? see, that's why you're so great.:::['1-13-295']
actually, it's quite typical behavior......when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic.:::['1-13-296']
you know, this kind of codependent......emotionally stunted......sitting in your stupid coffeehouse, with your stupid big cups......which, i'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them.:::['1-13-297']
and you're all like, "oh, define me. define me.:::['1-13-298']
love me. i need love.":::['1-13-299']
so you talked to your dad, huh?:::['1-13-300']
yeah. he's gonna keep cheating on ma, like she wanted.:::['1-13-301']
ma's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does.:::['1-13-302']
and my sister tina can't see her husband anymore......because he got a restraining order.:::['1-13-303']
which has nothing to do with it, except that i found out today.:::['1-13-304']
things sure have changed here on walton's mountain.:::['1-13-306']
so, joey, are you okay?:::['1-13-307']
it's just... you know, they're parents.:::['1-13-309']
after a certain point, you gotta let go.:::['1-13-310']
even if you know better......you gotta let them make their own mistakes.:::['1-13-311']
and just think......in a couple years, we get to turn into them.:::['1-13-312']
if i turn into my parents, i'll either be an alcoholic blond......chasing after 20-year-old boys......or i'll end up like my mom.:::['1-13-314']
hey. all: hey, pheebs.:::['1-13-315']
monica: how's it going?:::['1-13-316']
okay, except i broke up with roger.:::['1-13-317']
all: no, no, really. aw.:::['1-13-320']
what happened? - ugh. i don't know. i mean...:::['1-13-321']
he's a good person......and he can be really sweet.:::['1-13-322']
and in some ways, i think he is so right for me.:::['1-13-323']
it's just, i hate that guy.:::['1-13-324']
hey, joey. what's going on?:::['1-13-325']
clear the tracks for the boobie payback express.:::['1-13-326']
next stop, rachel green.:::['1-13-327']
joey, what the hell were you doing?:::['1-13-328']
sorry, wrong boobies.:::['1-13-329']
hello, joey.:::['1-13-330', '4-24-256']
hello, dear.:::['1-13-331']
are you excited about our honeymoon? yeah, i am.:::['8-3-0']
come on, pretty mama:::['8-3-1']
get it out of your system while we're alone.:::['8-3-2']
we came to say goodbye. have a great honeymoon.:::['8-3-3']
thanks. i'll go pack.:::['8-3-4']
i already packed. the only thing i couldn't find, though, was your speedo.:::['8-3-5']
speedo? uh, i don't have a speedo.:::['8-3-6']
i'm gonna go pack my regular, long bathing suit.:::['8-3-7']
good, you're still here. i wanted to tell you to have a good honeymoon.:::['8-3-8']
and i wanted you guys to know that i am telling the father today.:::['8-3-10']
we know it's ross. how? how do you know?:::['8-3-12']
it was his sweater. but, oh, my god!:::['8-3-13']
i so wanted ross to know first. but i'm so relieved that you guys know.:::['8-3-14']
that's so great. i'll be your baby's aunt! i know.:::['8-3-15']
me too! i'm gonna be an uncle! come here.:::['8-3-16']
you'll all be aunts and uncles. but i'm the only one related by blood.:::['8-3-17']
okay, great. now that you all know, you can give me advice on how to tell ross.:::['8-3-18']
that i'm gonna have the baby, and he can be as involved as he wants.:::['8-3-20']
well, that sounds good.:::['8-3-21']
yeah, but how do i start? what's the first thing that i say?:::['8-3-22']
okay, great. thanks. hey, good luck.:::['8-3-23']
phoebe: yeah, bye.:::['8-3-24']
what was that all about?:::['8-3-25', '10-16-160']
well, i guess no harm in telling you now. rachel and ross are having a baby.:::['8-3-26']
even know! why didn't you tell me?:::['8-3-27']
why am i talking like this?:::['8-3-28']
i didn't think you could keep it a secret.:::['8-3-29']
secret-keeper. i've kept all our secrets.:::['8-3-30']
what secrets? no, no, joey.:::['8-3-31']
i'm not gonna tell you because i am an excellent secret-keeper.:::['8-3-32']
psst. you'll tell me later? you already know.:::['8-3-33']
it's so romantic to send people off on their honeymoon.:::['8-3-34']
you know, monica and chandler are married. ross and rachel are having a baby.:::['8-3-35']
maybe you and i should do something. all in good time, my love. all in good time.:::['8-3-36']
oh, shoot. i left my guitar in their apartment. you can let me in later, right?:::['8-3-37']
no, i don't have a key. they took mine to give to you.:::['8-3-38']
what? they took mine to give to you. why would they take away our keys?:::['8-3-39']
maybe they don't trust us.:::['8-3-40']
they let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.:::['8-3-41']
you mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle... ...and cleaned it up with monica's guest towels?:::['8-3-42']
i washed those. no, you didn't.:::['8-3-43']
yeah, that didn't sound like me.:::['8-3-44']
what am i gonna do? i really need my guitar. i have stuff in there too.:::['8-3-45']
what stuff? monica's chicken parm. i'll take care of this.:::['8-3-46']
mr. treeger? it's joey tribbiani.:::['8-3-47']
i need to get into monica and chandler's apartment. it's an emergency.:::['8-3-48']
uh... uh... gas leak. oh, and bring garlic bread.:::['8-3-49']
did rachel find you? no, why?:::['8-3-51']
she was looking for you. well, i guess i'll catch up with her later.:::['8-3-52']
she really wanted to talk to you now. yeah, it seemed pretty important.:::['8-3-53']
oh, no. phoebe: what?:::['8-3-54']
i think i might know what this is about.:::['8-3-55']
yeah. we promised we weren't gonna tell anybody this......but a month ago,rachel and i slept together.:::['8-3-57']
and?:::['8-3-58', '10-10-328', '10-8-325']
wow, i thought you'd be more shocked. oh, sorry. and?:::['8-3-59']
well, we said we'd just do it that one time......but now i think she may:::['8-3-60']
wanna start things up again.:::['8-3-61']
yeah, i don't think that's what it is.:::['8-3-62']
why? what else could it be? oh, wow, i don't feel well.:::['8-3-63']
i'm telling you, i'm telling you, that's what it is.:::['8-3-64']
no wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding.:::['8-3-65']
she didn't say anything to you?:::['8-3-66']
maybe it's something you ate. it could've been...:::['8-3-67']
please, just go and talk to rachel. yeah, i guess i should.:::['8-3-68']
man, you know what i have to realize?:::['8-3-69']
maybe i'm not the type of guy women can have just one night with.:::['8-3-70']
they always seem to want a little bit more.:::['8-3-71']
i should remember that.:::['8-3-72']
clerk: next.:::['8-3-73']
they're kissing. let's go around them. leave them alone. they're in love.:::['8-3-74']
i'm in love too. but in an orderly fashion.:::['8-3-75']
next. hi. can you do that and walk?:::['8-3-76']
because she said, "next.":::['8-3-77']
sorry, we didn't hear you. we're on our honeymoon.:::['8-3-78']
aw. let me see what i can do. there are some first-class seats available.:::['8-3-79']
they bumped them up to first class because they're on their honeymoon.:::['8-3-80']
let's act like we're on our honeymoon. we are on our honeymoon.:::['8-3-81']
grab my ass. next.:::['8-3-82']
sorry, i almost didn't hear you because i'm so in love with my new husband.:::['8-3-83']
we're on our honeymoon. congratulations.:::['8-3-84']
mr. bing, you'll be in 25j, and mrs. bing, you're in 25k.:::['8-3-85']
we're on our honeymoon, so can you do your little thing, bump us up to first class?:::['8-3-86']
i'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken. that couple got the last two.:::['8-3-87']
if we'd gone around them like i said, she'd have given us those tickets. damn it.:::['8-3-88']
25j and k, any chance those aren't together?:::['8-3-89']
i still can't believe they took away my key. you trust me with yours.:::['8-3-90']
of course i do. and i'll give it back to you......as soon as they're done with it:::['8-3-91']
at the key-shining place.:::['8-3-92']
what the hell is that?:::['8-3-93', '4-12-0']
whoa, whoa. treeger, what are you doing? you said there was a gas leak in here.:::['8-3-94']
why don't you use your key? i won't find it before the place explodes.:::['8-3-95']
if that happens at another building i manage, people will start asking questions.:::['8-3-96']
come on, hurry up.:::['8-3-97']
we could have done that.:::['8-3-99']
look at that. they're going into the first-class lounge.:::['8-3-100']
do you know what they have in there? no.:::['8-3-101']
me neither. we have to get in!:::['8-3-102']
just act like you belong. oh, my god! oranges!:::['8-3-103']
shh!:::['8-3-104', '8-21-109', '9-2-310']
nice to see you again. sir, may i see your tickets, please?:::['8-3-105']
yes, of course.:::['8-3-106']
would you move your thumb. i can't see the seat number.:::['8-3-107']
that's all right. i have it memorized. it's 1a.:::['8-3-108']
sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. i'm sorry. apology accepted. excuse us.:::['8-3-109']
sir, i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to leave.:::['8-3-110']
go, go, go!:::['8-3-112']
i think there's something that we really need to talk about.:::['8-3-115']
i think we do. why don't we go inside.:::['8-3-116']
look, i know why you're here. you do?:::['8-3-118']
yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment, i think i should talk first.:::['8-3-119']
ross and rachel. rachel and ross. heh.:::['8-3-122']
it's been one heck of a seesaw, hasn't it?:::['8-3-123']
i mean, look, that one night we had was fun and certainly passionate.:::['8-3-125']
but don't you think it's better if we just stay friends?:::['8-3-126']
seriously, what?:::['8-3-127']
okay, okay. you know what?:::['8-3-128']
if you want to, we can do it one more time.:::['8-3-129']
i'd be okay with that. in fact, i have some time right now.:::['8-3-130']
you know what? ahem. can i talk now? oh, sure.:::['8-3-131']
i'm pregnant.:::['8-3-132']
okay, whenever you're ready.:::['8-3-134']
and you're the father, by the way. but you're good.:::['8-3-135']
can i get you some water? i'm good, i'm good.:::['8-3-136']
ross, there is no pressure on you. okay? you can be as involved as you want.:::['8-3-137']
yeah, i, uh... i'm just, i don't know. i don't understand......how this happened.:::['8-3-138']
we used a condom. i know.:::['8-3-139']
but you know, condoms only work, like, 97 percent of the time.:::['8-3-140']
well, they should put that on the box!:::['8-3-143']
they do. no, they don't!:::['8-3-144']
well, they should put it in huge block letters!:::['8-3-145']
let's just forget about the condoms. well, i may as well have!:::['8-3-146']
listen, i was really freaked out too when... freaked out? no, i'm not freaked out.:::['8-3-147']
i'm indignant as a consumer!:::['8-3-148']
you know what? let's talk later. no. no, i wanna talk now.:::['8-3-149']
in fact, i wanna talk to the president of the condom company.:::['8-3-150']
okay, maybe i should come back... shh!:::['8-3-151']
yeah, i'll press one!:::['8-3-152']
i looked everywhere. there's no gas leak. so now i can heat this up?:::['8-3-153']
anyway, i'll get moving on that new door.:::['8-3-154']
great. and could you do us a favor and not tell chandler and monica about this?:::['8-3-155']
because, you know, they don't have any kids of their own......and this door was:::['8-3-156']
like a child to them.:::['8-3-157']
i have to put on a new lock. they'll find out anyway.:::['8-3-158']
this looks like an all-day job. i'll have to cancel my yoga class.:::['8-3-160']
hey, ross. hey. could you tell jasmine i can't make it to yoga?:::['8-3-161']
my god. what happened to the door? so it's noticeable, huh?:::['8-3-163']
is rachel here? i really need to talk to her. didn't you two already talk?:::['8-3-164']
yeah, but...:::['8-3-165']
okay, look. you guys know rachel and i slept together, but there's something else.:::['8-3-166']
rachel's pregnant.:::['8-3-167']
holy mother of god! oh, my god! i can't believe it!:::['8-3-168']
with my child. that is brand-new information!:::['8-3-169']
you already know, don't you? a little bit.:::['8-3-170']
how you doing? okay. okay. i mean, i'll be okay.:::['8-3-171']
it's just i don't think i handled it very well.:::['8-3-172']
what did you say to her? nothing.:::['8-3-173']
but the complaint department at the condom company got an earful.:::['8-3-174']
then when i turned around, she was gone.:::['8-3-175']
but in my defense, i found out that condoms are only 97 percent effective.:::['8-3-177']
what? i gotta go find her.:::['8-3-178']
hold on! are you serious? so, like, 3 percent of the time they don't even work?:::['8-3-179']
huh? they should put that on the box!:::['8-3-180']
evidently, they do. what?:::['8-3-181']
i can't believe we're here. you've gotta be kidding.:::['8-3-182']
as a wedding gift to you, the hotel would like to give you the honeymoon suite.:::['8-3-184']
no! you have been screwing us all day!:::['8-3-185']
who are you? we're you. just 10 seconds later!:::['8-3-186']
you already got the first-class tickets, the lounge. we should get free stuff too!:::['8-3-187']
you're not the only ones on your honeymoon!:::['8-3-188']
you can have the suite, if you want. we don't care about where we stay.:::['8-3-189']
we're here to celebrate our love for each other. we don't have to get free stuff.:::['8-3-190']
we just want to be together.:::['8-3-191']
we need the stuff.:::['8-3-192']
hey, monica, it's joey. phoebe and i smell gas coming from your apartment.:::['8-3-193']
are you serious? joey smells gas. what else is new?:::['8-3-194']
we'd check it out, but you took our keys. do something. get in there!:::['8-3-195']
how? i guess i could break down your door. yeah, do that.:::['8-3-196']
you won't blame us for any damage? no.:::['8-3-197']
are you doing it? i can't hear anything. okay, i'll break it down.:::['8-3-198']
he's doing it, he's breaking down the door.:::['8-3-199']
okay, we're in.:::['8-3-200']
rachel, are you comfortable? if i said i was, would you judge me?:::['8-3-201']
the doctor will be here soon to do your sonogram.:::['8-3-202']
oh, man, i swear, if they sold these at pottery barn...:::['8-3-204']
we need to talk.:::['8-3-206']
right now? i kind of got an alfresco situation going on over here.:::['8-3-207']
please. please, i want to apologize for the way i acted earlier today.:::['8-3-208']
that's fine. can you stay up near my head? yeah, sorry.:::['8-3-209']
i went crazy. i was thinking about myself when i should've been thinking about you.:::['8-3-210']
head, ross. head, ross. head, ross. right.:::['8-3-211']
i want you to know that i'll be there through this whole thing. okay?:::['8-3-212']
the doctor's appointments, lamaze classes, baby-proofing the apartment.:::['8-3-213']
we can do that after we get married. married?:::['8-3-214']
yeah, we should get married.:::['8-3-215']
because that's your answer to everything?:::['8-3-216']
no, because that's the right thing to do.:::['8-3-217']
yeah, maybe, if you're in love. but, ross, we are not in love, are we?:::['8-3-218']
no, but still, i mean, you can't possibly do this alone.:::['8-3-219']
come on, you can't even eat alone in a restaurant.:::['8-3-221']
what? i'm saying if you can't eat by yourself... ...how can you have a baby by yourself?:::['8-3-222']
i can too eat by myself. when have you ever?:::['8-3-223']
when certain people leave the table and i am not finished!:::['8-3-224']
well, certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup.:::['8-3-225']
please, you inhale your food.:::['8-3-226']
i grew up with monica. if you didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!:::['8-3-227']
am i interrupting?:::['8-3-228']
no, dr. long, please come in. this is ross, he's the father.:::['8-3-229']
but not the husband, because she can do this alone.:::['8-3-230']
nice to meet you. i'll get started on this.:::['8-3-231']
why can't you admit you need me? i need you. i need you to stay near my head!:::['8-3-232']
okay. everything looks good. here it is on the screen.:::['8-3-233']
there's your uterus......and right here is your baby.:::['8-3-234']
there it is, i see it.:::['8-3-237']
congratulations. i'll give you two a minute.:::['8-3-238']
pretty amazing, huh?:::['8-3-240']
i don't see it!:::['8-3-241']
what? what? i can't see it.:::['8-3-242']
you just said that you did. i know, i lied.:::['8-3-243']
i didn't want her to think i was a terrible mother. i can't even see my own baby.:::['8-3-244']
come here. sure you can. come here. look, it's right there.:::['8-3-245']
oh, it's beautiful.:::['8-3-247', '9-12-317']
i see it now.:::['8-3-248']
do you really? no, i don't see it!:::['8-3-249']
okay, come on. come on. all right. okay. okay.:::['8-3-250']
you see this tiny thing that looks like a peanut?:::['8-3-251']
sweetie, that's it.:::['8-3-253']
that's it? well, i saw that.:::['8-3-254']
oh, thank you. you're welcome.:::['8-3-256']
wow, i can't believe that's our baby.:::['8-3-257']
yeah, that's our baby.:::['8-3-258']
so how was the doctor? everything went great.:::['8-3-260']
good. hey, show them the picture of your uterus.:::['8-3-261']
phoebe: aw.:::['8-3-262', '5-19-242']
i don't see the baby. where is it?:::['8-3-263']
i know, i couldn't see it either at first. but it's right, um...:::['8-3-264']
ross, i lost it again.:::['8-3-265']
listen, you know what? sir, for the last time, i don't care what the computer says.:::['8-2-0']
we did not take a bag of meshugga nuts from the minibar.:::['8-2-1']
and we did not watch dr. do-me-a-little.:::['8-2-2']
hey. oh.:::['8-2-3']
joey, were you in our room last night? no.:::['8-2-4']
i was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill.:::['8-2-5']
hi, we're checking out of the bridal suite. that's right, i'm no longer a bride.:::['8-2-6']
i'll never be a bride again. now i'm just someone's wife.:::['8-2-7']
and i'm the happiest guy in the world.:::['8-2-8']
come on, honey. don't be upset. we have so much to look forward to.:::['8-2-9']
the honeymoon. that's not till thursday.:::['8-2-11']
the wedding pictures. those won't be ready weeks.:::['8-2-12']
not the disposable cameras from the tables. that's true! i knew i married you for a reason!:::['8-2-13']
i'll tell you what. i will go get them developed, and you can go home.:::['8-2-14']
what? what did you take a picture of? nothing. it was something.:::['8-2-15']
okay, ross has the cameras. is he checked out yet?:::['8-2-16']
are you joking? checkout is not till noon.:::['8-2-17']
and he has a good 11 minutes left. so?:::['8-2-18']
so ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.:::['8-2-19']
yeah, one time when we were dating......we got a late checkout, he got so excited,it was the best sex we ever had.:::['8-2-20']
until he screamed out "radisson" at the end.:::['8-2-21']
okay, i'm gonna get ross, get the cameras, and get them developed.:::['8-2-22']
thirty-two, joe. you're 32!:::['8-2-23']
here's a copy of your bill. oh, thanks.:::['8-2-24']
champagne, strawberries...:::['8-2-25']
oh, my god! i can't believe chandler ordered porn on our wedding night.:::['8-2-26']
yeah, that's sad. meshugga nut?:::['8-2-27']
soaps, shampoos. are you really taking all this stuff?:::['8-2-29']
why not? it's built into the price of the room. yeah, but you don't need...:::['8-2-30']
what is this? thread.:::['8-2-31']
score!:::['8-2-32']
where are the disposable cameras? what disposable cameras?:::['8-2-33']
last night i asked you to take them.:::['8-2-34']
no, you didn't. yes, before we cut the cake, i said...:::['8-2-35']
yeah, you came up to me and asked me for a favor.:::['8-2-36']
and then my uncle murray came up to you and handed you a check.:::['8-2-37']
then you said, "why do they call it a check? why not a yugoslavian?":::['8-2-38']
yeah, then you did that. so you don't have the cameras?:::['8-2-39']
no, sorry. so what? what?:::['8-2-40']
they're gone? monica's gonna freak! i'm sure they're here somewhere.:::['8-2-41']
i'll help you look.:::['8-2-42']
great. in three minutes.:::['8-2-43']
hey hey.:::['8-2-44']
are you gonna open the presents without chandler?:::['8-2-45']
they're calling out to me. this little guy even crawled up in my lap.:::['8-2-47']
come on, chandler wouldn't mind if i opened just one present. what do you think it is?:::['8-2-48']
a mirror that when you look into it, you see yourself as an old woman.:::['8-2-49']
a tiny salt shaker!:::['8-2-50']
oh, my god, for tiny salt!:::['8-2-51']
oh, wow! okay, that was fun. oh, yeah.:::['8-2-52']
i'm just gonna wait for chandler to open up the rest of them. okay. whoo!:::['8-2-53']
although, you know, this is part of a salt-and-pepper set.:::['8-2-54']
so i guess it may just count as half a present. what do you think?:::['8-2-55']
well, i guess it's okay to open one more if it's part of a set. it's probably this one.:::['8-2-56']
or this one!:::['8-2-57']
how you feeling? got any morning sickness? shh! the guys don't know yet, do they?:::['8-2-59']
no. joey and ross don't know anything, and chandler thinks phoebe's pregnant.:::['8-2-60']
that's right. chandler does still think i'm pregnant.:::['8-2-61']
he hasn't asked me how i'm feeling, or offered to carry my bags.:::['8-2-62']
i feel bad for the woman who ends up with him.:::['8-2-63']
after you, of course.:::['8-2-64']
don't worry. i promise that you will only have to be pregnant a few more hours.:::['8-2-65']
i'm going to tell the father today.:::['8-2-66']
is it someone in this building? that tall guy from the first floor?:::['8-2-67']
eww! no! what? i think he's cute.:::['8-2-68']
well, then you have his baby. believe me, i'm trying.:::['8-2-69']
wow. it's so weird. you're gonna tell this guy today......and he has no idea:::['8-2-70']
what's gonna happen.:::['8-2-71']
yeah. you're just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever.:::['8-2-72']
you're like ed mcmahon, except without the big check.:::['8-2-73']
or the raw sexual magnetism.:::['8-2-74']
yeah, i guess it is pretty big news. pretty big? it's huge!:::['8-2-75']
god, this guy doesn't have a clue. he's walking around thinking::::['8-2-76']
"i had sex with rachel green. i rock!":::['8-2-77']
then, bam! he's a father, everything's different.:::['8-2-78']
well, it's only different if he wants it to be. i'm not gonna ask him for anything.:::['8-2-79']
then he still has this huge decision to make. now he's thinking::::['8-2-80']
"do i want to be a dad?" then, bam!:::['8-2-81']
what was that "bam"? i don't know. he's hit by a bus.:::['8-2-82']
rachel: hi. hey.:::['8-2-83', '9-19-137']
joey, what would you do if someone you slept with told you she was pregnant?:::['8-2-84']
who called here?:::['8-2-85']
did she sound blond? any accent? i gotta make a call.:::['8-2-86']
should have never walked into that sunglass hut!:::['8-2-87']
oh, joey! joey! it's not you! you didn't get anyone pregnant.:::['8-2-88']
why would you scare me like that? what the hell's going on?:::['8-2-89']
is somebody pregnant?:::['8-2-90']
oh, yeah! that's me.:::['8-2-91']
oh, my god, pheebs! you're gonna have a baby?:::['8-2-92']
yes, i am. oh, my god, i'm gonna have a baby!:::['8-2-93']
wait, who's the father? you don't know him.:::['8-2-94']
he wants nothing to do with me or the baby.:::['8-2-95']
who is this guy? who is he? because i'll track him down and kick his ass!:::['8-2-96']
david linn. david linn! david linn! david linn!:::['8-2-97']
who's david linn? some guy from my gym. a little annoying.:::['8-2-98']
chandler? hey. did you find the cameras?:::['8-2-99']
no. did you?:::['8-2-100']
yes, that's why i'm under the table. celebrating.:::['8-2-101']
i checked in the lost and found. i talked to the manager. no one's turned them in.:::['8-2-102']
great. those cameras were the only thing that will cheer monica up. she's depressed.:::['8-2-103']
you guys just got married. why is she so depressed?:::['8-2-104']
all my energy is going into not asking that question.:::['8-2-105']
i can't believe i screwed this up! i'm sorry, man.:::['8-2-106']
here's a thought. this is the same ballroom.:::['8-2-107']
there's a band. there's gonna be plenty of dressed up people.:::['8-2-108']
are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?:::['8-2-109']
no, we buy more of these at the gift shop, throw our tuxes on and take a few pictures.:::['8-2-110']
all have to do is make sure not to get people's faces.:::['8-2-111']
are you serious?:::['8-2-112', '8-19-115', '7-20-97', '10-7-12', '5-21-40', '5-14-148', '4-11-295', '4-19-75']
i'm just thinking about your new bride.:::['8-2-113']
okay? do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?:::['8-2-114']
marriage advice? really?:::['8-2-115']
i'm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding.:::['8-2-116']
aren't these the same flowers? i don't know. monica picked them.:::['8-2-117']
the chairs? those too.:::['8-2-118']
the place settings? her.:::['8-2-119']
what did you do? i was in charge of the cameras.:::['8-2-120']
gift shop? mm.:::['8-2-121']
did you do it yet? not yet.:::['8-2-123']
then what are you doing here? are you about to do it?:::['8-2-124']
is it gunther? no...:::['8-2-125']
it's not gunther! thank god. that hair on a baby?:::['8-2-126']
the father is not here. i haven't told him, and i don't think i can now.:::['8-2-127']
why not? now let me think.:::['8-2-128']
i was walking down the street, thinking, "i'm gonna tell the father today." and then, bam!:::['8-2-129']
bus?:::['8-2-130']
no, you! you freaked me out. you kept saying how huge this all is.:::['8-2-131']
but it is huge. i know.:::['8-2-132']
but i was just thinking about how huge it was for me.:::['8-2-133']
i didn't go to how huge this is gonna be for the father.:::['8-2-134']
you're thinking about this way too much. just tell him and get it over with.:::['8-2-135']
it's like ripping off this band-aid, quick and painless. watch.:::['8-2-136']
oh, mother of...!:::['8-2-137']
ooh. are we opening presents? no. i shouldn't have even opened these.:::['8-2-139']
joey, i am out of control! you have to do me a favor.:::['8-2-140']
no matter what i say, no matter what i do, please do not let me open another present.:::['8-2-141']
okay? okay.:::['8-2-142']
give me one more. okay.:::['8-2-143']
hey. oh, good. you're here. pheebs? listen...:::['8-2-144']
sit down, i got something i want to say. all right.:::['8-2-145']
it's a scary world out there, especially for a single mom.:::['8-2-147', '8-2-230']
now, i always felt that you and i have a special bond.:::['8-2-148']
so, phoebe buffay, will you marry me?:::['8-2-149']
joey! oh, yeah, i'll marry you.:::['8-2-151']
you can't marry him! hey, lady, your day's over, it's my turn.:::['8-2-152']
phoebe! what? why can't she marry me?:::['8-2-153']
i can and i will.:::['8-2-154']
she's not pregnant. it's rachel. rachel's the one who's pregnant, okay.:::['8-2-155']
oh, my god! hey.:::['8-2-156']
he'd notice when you didn't have a baby in nine months!:::['8-2-157']
it's joey!:::['8-2-158']
i can't believe it! rachel's pregnant? yeah. who's the father?:::['8-2-160']
we don't know.:::['8-2-161']
i wonder if it's that dude. there's a dude?:::['8-2-162']
yeah. who is it?:::['8-2-163']
a month ago this guy spent the night. i didn't see who it was, but...:::['8-2-164']
was that story over?:::['8-2-165']
the guy left this.:::['8-2-166']
oh, my god! i know who the father is.:::['8-2-167']
people have got to finish their stories.:::['8-2-168']
excuse me. could you take a picture of us? oh. of course.:::['8-2-169']
would you take one of us? uh. yeah, sure.:::['8-2-170']

but there was no flash. why won't you take our picture?:::['8-2-173']
yeah, i'll take your picture.:::['8-2-174']
your finger was covering the lens. who are you, ansel adams? get out of here!:::['8-2-175']
look, i feel really bad about how i freaked you out before......so i called the father:::['8-2-176']
and asked him to meet you here. go!:::['8-2-177']
what? wait a minute. how do you even know who the father is?:::['8-2-178']
i may play the fool at times......but i'm more than a pretty blond:::['8-2-179']
with an ass that won't quit.:::['8-2-180']
i believe this belongs to the father of your baby.:::['8-2-181']
oh, god. oh. he's in there right now? uh-huh.:::['8-2-182']
you can turn around, or you can go in there and rip the band-aid off. what do you wanna do?:::['8-2-183']
let's rip. really? are you sure?:::['8-2-184']
phoebe! okay. sorry. yeah.:::['8-2-185']

so, what's this about?:::['8-2-199']
rachel has something that she wants to tell you.:::['8-2-200']
and i believe that this is your red sweater.:::['8-2-201']
no, this is my red sweater.:::['8-2-202']
could i get anyone a coffee?:::['8-2-204']
or poison? no? just for me? okay.:::['8-2-205']
nothing. phoebe kind of made a mistake.:::['8-2-207']
but you do wear that sweater a lot. are you involved in some kind of dare?:::['8-2-208']
i'm actually glad phoebe called.:::['8-2-209']
i know we broke up because you thought i wasn't mature enough......but i've really grown up.:::['8-2-210']
and i think we should get back together.:::['8-2-211']
it's just not the right time.:::['8-2-212']
it is the right time. okay.:::['8-2-213']
i'm ready for more. tag.:::['8-2-214']

i'm having a baby. oh.:::['8-2-216']
you can go. thank you.:::['8-2-217', '5-22-60']
i don't know how any of these got opened!:::['8-2-218']
you opened them all? i know, i am a terrible person.:::['8-2-219']
chandler's never gonna trust me with anything ever again.:::['8-2-220']
hey! you got my parents' gift. yeah. what is that?:::['8-2-221']
i don't know. i think it does something to salami.:::['8-2-222']
hey. how'd it go? yeah. what did tag say?:::['8-2-223']
tag is not the father. and joey knows now?:::['8-2-224']
i do, rach. i do. and i'm so happy for you.:::['8-2-225']
oh. wow, you didn't even try to unhook my bra.:::['8-2-226']
so are you ever gonna tell whoever it is? i will, i'm just not up for it tonight.:::['8-2-227']
hey, rach, listen. no matter what he says, you're not gonna be alone.:::['8-2-228']
i'm not? no. listen, i, uh...:::['8-2-229']
aww.:::['8-2-231', '3-18-66', '3-9-349']
i've always felt like you and i have this special bond.:::['8-2-232']
rachel green, will you marry me? what?:::['8-2-233']
what? what?!:::['8-2-234']
pheebs, give me the ring back. no!:::['8-2-235']
joey, you're so sweet. you are so, so sweet, honey. but i'm not looking for a husband.:::['8-2-236']
now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to go and lie down.:::['8-2-238']
i can't say that didn't hurt.:::['8-2-239']
but i'll take you back, joey. about that, i...:::['8-2-240']

yeah. and interesting, because i found the cameras in one of our bags.:::['8-2-250']
huh. didn't see that coming.:::['8-2-251']
okay, so this isn't the picture of our first kiss......but it is a picture of my first kiss:::['8-2-252']
with this lady.:::['8-2-253']
which, by the look on your face, i'm sure you'll remember, so there's no need...:::['8-2-254']
i'll take the real pictures to them developed. that'd be a good idea. okay.:::['8-2-255']
you opened all the presents without me? we were gonna do that together.:::['8-2-256']
you kissed another woman?:::['8-2-257']
call it even? okay.:::['8-2-258']
well, i'm gonna go get these in some water. you stole those from that wedding?:::['8-2-259']
no, the hotel lobby. they think they can charge me for some dirty movie......and a bag of meshugga nuts:::['8-2-260']
they got another thing coming!:::['8-2-261']
hey, my sweater!:::['8-2-262']
i've been looking for this for like a month.:::['8-2-263']

okay. he is so weird.:::['8-2-271']
photographer: great. great. just give me a sec to change film.:::['8-1-0']

why? what's going on? monica's pregnant.:::['8-1-2']
oh, my god! is that why you guys had to get married?:::['8-1-3']
guys, i'm not pregnant! ah, slow swimmers?:::['8-1-4']
what? what do you mean? you're not pregnant?:::['8-1-5']
you didn't tell anybody i was, did you? no.:::['8-1-6']
now why don't we get a shot of monica and the bloody soldier?:::['8-1-8']
oh, about that. joey, you have to change before the party.:::['8-1-9']
i can't. i don't have any other clothes.:::['8-1-10']
find some. please! anything that doesn't say, "i died tragically in france.":::['8-1-11']
then why don't we see the bride and the groom, and the bridesmaids?:::['8-1-12']
hey, mon? why did you tell the guys that you weren't pregnant?:::['8-1-13']
because i'm not.:::['8-1-14']
we found your test in the trash. if you're not pregnant......it's because i am.:::['8-1-15']
both: what are you talking about?:::['8-1-16']
yes. ahem. i am with child.:::['8-1-17']
and i didn't wanna say anything because it's your day.:::['8-1-18']
i didn't wanna steal your thunder. so you told people i was pregnant?:::['8-1-19']
does this look like a conversation i wanna remember?:::['8-1-20']
who's the father? yeah.:::['8-1-21']
i can't say.:::['8-1-22', '2-23-312']
why? why not?:::['8-1-23', '5-2-190']
i can't say because he's famous.:::['8-1-24']
oh, my god, who is it?:::['8-1-25']
come on, you have to tell us.:::['8-1-26']
okay, okay. it's james brolin.:::['8-1-27']
james brolin is the father of my baby.:::['8-1-28']
as in, barbra streisand's husband, james brolin?:::['8-1-29']
what? he never said that to me.:::['8-1-30']
monica, if you can step away, we'll get chandler and the bridesmaids.:::['8-1-31']
how about just the bridesmaids?:::['8-1-32']
i am the groom. i was told it was kind of a big deal.:::['8-1-33']
phoebe: it is. rachel: yeah.:::['8-1-34']
oh, my god! thank you for doing that.:::['8-1-35']
i just can't deal with this just quite yet.:::['8-1-36']
so instead you told me monica was pregnant? you did, i just didn't disagree.:::['8-1-37']
sneaky! yeah.:::['8-1-38']
photographer: smile, ladies! ohh.:::['8-1-39']
by the way, james brolin? ugh. i know.:::['8-1-40']
i could only think of two names: him and ed begley jr. and then...:::['8-1-41']
i remembered he's gay, so...:::['8-1-42']
ed begley jr. is not gay. really?:::['8-1-43']
thank you very much. ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure......to introduce to you:::['8-1-44']
for the first time::::['8-1-45']

so would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?:::['8-1-51']
yes. okay.:::['8-1-52', '5-17-262']
what's the matter? these new shoes are all slippery.:::['8-1-53']
are you going to be able to do this? not well.:::['8-1-54']
well, the good news is i don't think anyone's looking at us.:::['8-1-55']
so you ready to talk about it? no.:::['8-1-56']
now?:::['8-1-57', '4-2-92']
okay, we'll talk about something else.:::['8-1-59']
thank you. who's the father?:::['8-1-60']
uh. look, honey, i haven't told him yet......so until i do,i don't think i should tell anybody else.:::['8-1-61']
yeah. that's fine. that's fair. is it tag?:::['8-1-62']
ugh. phoebe!:::['8-1-63']
okay. i'm sorry, i'll stop. okay.:::['8-1-64']
is it ross? it's ross, isn't it?:::['8-1-65']
oh, my god, it's joey! honey, stop it, okay?:::['8-1-66']

ah-ha! at least we know it's a him.:::['8-1-68']
oh, sweet lord.:::['8-1-69']
i'm sorry, okay?:::['8-1-70']
i went down to the gift shop, and it was either this or a bathrobe.:::['8-1-71']

honey, i'm not even going to pretend i was listening. hey! hey.:::['8-1-73']
i'm ross. i don't believe we've met. i'm monica's older brother.:::['8-1-75']
hi, i'm mona from her restaurant. oh.:::['8-1-76']
hello, "mona from her restaurant.":::['8-1-77']
mona. what a beautiful name.:::['8-1-78']
you think so? i always kind of hated it.:::['8-1-79']
aw, come on! mona lisa? uh-huh.:::['8-1-80']
mona......klegglachen?:::['8-1-81']
the famous botanist. huh?:::['8-1-82']
oh, no. she's... well, she's dead now.:::['8-1-83']
but supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.:::['8-1-84']
well, see, i never knew about her. linda klegglachen...:::['8-1-86']
so, what table are you at?:::['8-1-87']
oh, heh, me too.:::['8-1-88']

yes, there will.:::['8-1-90']
guess what, molly gilbert. you've just been bumped up to table one.:::['8-1-91']
and if it's all right with you, i'm gonna take your place at table six.:::['8-1-92']
martin klegglachen!:::['8-1-93']
that's better. just bend your arms a little more. there you go. look straight ahead.:::['8-1-94']
now this time i want you to really put your ass into it.:::['8-1-95']
chandler, darling. look, my date has finally arrived. i'd like you to meet dennis phillips.:::['8-1-96']
congratulations. thanks.:::['8-1-97']
dennis is a dear old friend. and a fantastic lover.:::['8-1-98']
bravo, dennis, thanks for pleasing my mother so.:::['8-1-99']
i'm so sorry i missed the ceremony. i was stuck at auditions.:::['8-1-100']
dennis is directing a new broadway show.:::['8-1-101']
hi, i don't believe we've met. joey tribbiani.:::['8-1-102']
dennis phillips. wow. i've admired your work for years.:::['8-1-103']
you've done some amazing stuff.:::['8-1-104']
thank you. excuse me, i'll get myself a drink. i'll be back in a moment.:::['8-1-105']
dennis phillips! that's great! how did you guys meet?:::['8-1-106']
well, you know, it's a funny story. funny "ha-ha," or funny "boom, uh-oh!":::['8-1-107']
thank you very much. now if everyone will please take their seats, dinner will be served.:::['8-1-108']
uh, i thought you were at table six. uh, no. nine.:::['8-1-110']
ohh. see, before, when you showed it to me, you held it that way......which was misleading.:::['8-1-111']
well... i'll... um...:::['8-1-112']
chandler! will you see if your mom can give my résumé to dennis phillips?:::['8-1-114']
because if i can get into a broadway show, i would've done it all::::['8-1-115']
film, television and theater.:::['8-1-116']
the only thing left would be radio, and that's just for ugly people.:::['8-1-117']
what size shoes do you wear? uh, eleven. eleven and a half.:::['8-1-118']
great. my shoes are giving me a problem on the dance floor.:::['8-1-119']
can i borrow the boots from your costume? i don't know where i left those, so...:::['8-1-120']
those aren't eleven and a half. okay, fine, i'm a 7!:::['8-1-121']
all right, i have surprisingly small feet. but the rest of me is good! i'll show you!:::['8-1-122']
can you believe phoebe got pregnant? let's not talk about that now.:::['8-1-123']
this is so huge. sure, but as big as your wedding?:::['8-1-124']
of course not. nothing is.:::['8-1-125']
wow. between me and you? yeah.:::['8-1-126']
in this day and age, how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?:::['8-1-127']
hey, sometimes you can do everything right, wear what you're supposed to......and one of those little guys:::['8-1-128']
just gets through.:::['8-1-129']
how? i don't know, maybe they have tools.:::['8-1-130']
well, i talked to her, and she's definitely gonna have this baby.:::['8-1-131']
she's gonna raise it on her own.:::['8-1-132']
well, maybe that's really brave.:::['8-1-133']
i just hope she realizes how hard it's gonna be.:::['8-1-134']
maybe she hasn't really thought it through that much.:::['8-1-135']
there's a lot to think about.:::['8-1-136']
how is she gonna handle this financially? how is she gonna juggle work?:::['8-1-137']
does she realize she's not gonna have a date again for the next 18 years?:::['8-1-138']
i'm just thinking about phoebe. poor, knocked-up phoebe.:::['8-1-142']
champagne? oh, yes. thank you very much. whew.:::['8-1-143']
that's actually how the french drink it.:::['8-1-144']
well, i just got off the phone with my lover, james brolin.:::['8-1-145']
really? yes. and apparently, he is married to some singer.:::['8-1-146']
but he said he'd leave her for me. so i said, "are you sure?":::['8-1-147']
and james brolin said... rachel's the one who's pregnant?:::['8-1-148']
why bother?:::['8-1-150']
i don't know how i feel. this is all happening so fast. i have to make all these decisions that i don't want to make.:::['8-1-152']
mm! oh! someone take this away from me!:::['8-1-153']
calm down. maybe you're not pregnant. what?:::['8-1-154']
when i got pregnant with the triplets, i took the test three times.:::['8-1-155']
yes. maybe it's a false-positive. are you sure you peed on the stick right?:::['8-1-156']
how many ways are there to do that?:::['8-1-157']
i'm just saying, don't freak out until you're 100 percent sure.:::['8-1-158']
i'll take it again at home.:::['8-1-159']
you gotta take it now, as a present to me.:::['8-1-160']
okay. thank you.:::['8-1-161', '9-11-19']
i'll run out and get you one. aw, you girls are so great.:::['8-1-162']
wait a minute. who's the father?:::['8-1-163']
she won't tell us. come on! it's my wedding. that could be my present.:::['8-1-164']
hey! i just gave you peeing on a stick. see, this is why you register.:::['8-1-165']
it was the chair again, okay? i'm not doing it!:::['8-1-166']
it was... look, i don't. you know what?:::['8-1-167']
would you like to dance? sure.:::['8-1-169']
yeah. oh, great.:::['8-1-170']
dr. geller? i wasn't farting!:::['8-1-171']
uh, a little game from our table.:::['8-1-172']
yes? dr. geller, will you dance with me?:::['8-1-173']
oh. um...:::['8-1-174', '5-19-79']
maybe later. i'm about to dance with this lady.:::['8-1-175']
ooooh.:::['8-1-177']
unless this lady wouldn't mind letting you go first.:::['8-1-178']
i'd be happy to. you are very sweet.:::['8-1-179']
ohh. yes, i am.:::['8-1-180']
in fact, why don't we try it my special way. you can dance on my feet.:::['8-1-181']
sure. yeah? hop on.:::['8-1-182']
is the pretty lady looking? uh-huh. keep dancing.:::['8-1-183']
music playing]:::['8-1-184']
and the world will never know.:::['8-1-185']
hey! did you talk to dennis? yes. i told him how talented you were.:::['8-1-186']
i told him all about days ofour lives. no, you don't tell a broadway guy that!:::['8-1-187']
now he thinks i'm just a soap actor. but you're not just a soap actor.:::['8-1-188']
you are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.:::['8-1-189']
thank you. no, thank you, miranda.:::['8-1-191']
melinda. all right.:::['8-1-192']
how cute was that? oh! were you watching?:::['8-1-193']
can i go next? uh...:::['8-1-194']
of course you can. hop on.:::['8-1-195']
okay. but i get to hop on after her.:::['8-1-196']
i am so gonna score! what?:::['8-1-197']
i like your bow.:::['8-1-198']
i'd like to propose a toast to monica and chandler......the greatest couple in the world,and my best friends.:::['8-1-199']
when i first found out they were getting married, i was a little angry.:::['8-1-200']
i was like, "why, god? how can you take them away from me?!":::['8-1-201']
but then i thought back over our memories together. some happy memories.:::['8-1-202']
then there were some sad memories.:::['8-1-203']
and some scared memories. whoa!:::['8-1-205']
and then i realized i'll always be their friend.:::['8-1-207']
their friend who can speak in many dialects......has training in stage combat:::['8-1-208']
and is willing to do partial nudity.:::['8-1-209']
oh... to the happy couple.:::['8-1-210']
that was nice. can we do it again?:::['8-1-211']
so is it my turn? i'm next.:::['8-1-213']
that's okay, you can dance with her first. are you sure?:::['8-1-215']
so what's your name? gert.:::['8-1-217']
that's pretty.:::['8-1-218']
whoa! whoa!:::['8-1-220']
what are you doing, gert?:::['8-1-221']
dancing on your feet like the other girls did it.:::['8-1-222']
hop on, gert.:::['8-1-224']
why aren't you moving your feet? i'm trying.:::['8-1-225']
faster! you're not going fast enough!:::['8-1-226']
maybe i should stand on your feet!:::['8-1-227']
so did you happen to catch my toast up there?:::['8-1-228']
oh, my god. that was for my benefit? well, i like to think there was something for everyone.:::['8-1-229']
i know you're casting for this new show. look, joey, i don't think you're right for it.:::['8-1-230']
see, that's where you're wrong. whatever it is, i can do it.:::['8-1-231']
and if you didn't see it up there, just try me. it's an all-chinese cast.:::['8-1-232']
can you be chinese?:::['8-1-233']
i'm not proud of this, but... oh, my god. no, please! don't!:::['8-1-234']
ready to get back on the dance floor? did it turn into sand?:::['8-1-235']
come on, i love this song. you'll be fine. no, i won't.:::['8-1-236']
do you know why i took all those lessons?:::['8-1-237']
for the first time, i didn't want you to be embarrassed......to be seen on the dance floor:::['8-1-238']
with some clumsy idiot.:::['8-1-239']
aww. sweetie, you could never embarrass me.:::['8-1-240']
okay, you could easily embarrass me. but it doesn't matter. right?:::['8-1-241']
i married you.:::['8-1-242']
so i'm gonna dance on my wedding night with my husband. come on!:::['8-1-243']
just try not to move your feet at all. oh.:::['8-1-244']
chandler, i'm gonna have you arrested. why?:::['8-1-246']
you stole my moves.:::['8-1-247']
how much longer? thirty seconds.:::['8-1-248']
thirty seconds. okay.:::['8-1-249']
did i miss it?:::['8-1-250', '2-11-56']
rachel, i want you to know... ...that if it's positive, we...:::['8-1-251']
i know. i know. you do? okay.:::['8-1-252']
it's time.:::['8-1-253']
all: no!:::['8-1-254', '9-20-185', '10-16-223']
go ahead, rach. oh, wait. you know what? i can't look at it.:::['8-1-255']
i can't look at it. somebody else tell me.:::['8-1-256']
phoebe: okay. okay.:::['8-1-257', '10-16-154']
it's negative.:::['8-1-258']
what? it's negative.:::['8-1-259']
whew!:::['8-1-262']
that is... that is really great, great news.:::['8-1-263']
because the whole......not being ready,the financial aspects, all that...:::['8-1-264']
this is so just the way it was supposed to be.:::['8-1-265']
well then, great.:::['8-1-266']
god. this is so stupid.:::['8-1-267']
how can i be upset over something i never had?:::['8-1-268']
it's negative? no, it's positive.:::['8-1-269']
what? it's not negative, it's positive.:::['8-1-270']
are you sure? yeah, i lied before.:::['8-1-271']
now you know how you really feel about it. oh! that's a risky little game.:::['8-1-274']
are you really gonna do this?:::['8-1-275']
yeah. i'm gonna have a baby.:::['8-1-276']
i'm gonna have a baby!:::['8-1-277']
with who? no, it's still not the time.:::['8-1-278']
i just didn't see the fast song coming.:::['8-1-279']
shh. don't try to talk. we'll get you up to your room, soak your feet. you'll be okay.:::['8-1-280']
oh, thank you. that is so sweet!:::['8-1-281']
yeah. no, i mean it. there's so few genuinely nice guys out there.:::['8-1-282']
tell me about it. i feel like i'm holding down the fort all by myself.:::['8-1-283']
it's joey, right? yeah.:::['8-1-284']
wait a minute! no! i'm the nice one!:::['8-1-285']
i'm the one that danced with the kids all night.:::['8-1-286']
how small are your feet?:::['8-1-287']
okay, this one's rare. this one is medium well. go!:::['8-5-0']
hey, phoebe! how was dinner? hey!:::['8-5-1']
dinner was good! just saying hi! now i'm gonna go!:::['8-5-2']
all right, okay.:::['8-5-3']
oh. well, hello there. hi.:::['8-5-4']
i didn't see this on the menu.:::['8-5-5']
phoebe, this is tim, my new sous chef.:::['8-5-6']
oh. so you're monica's boss? actually, she's my boss.:::['8-5-7']
"sous" is french for "under." ah! i "sous-stand." heh.:::['8-5-8']
tim, i need a calamari and a caesar salad. and could you get me the pesto?:::['8-5-9']
yeah. you made pesto?:::['8-5-10']
yes, i did.:::['8-5-11', '3-4-167']
would you say your pesto is the best-o? heh.:::['8-5-12']
i don't know. i would say it's pretty good-o.:::['8-5-13']
i still need the calamari and the salad.:::['8-5-14']
i like your necklace. oh, i made it myself.:::['8-5-15']
you are so talented. well, it's no pesto.:::['8-5-16']
all right, let's just cut to the chase. okay? you're single, you're single.:::['8-5-17']
he gets off work at 11. she'll be waiting for your call.:::['8-5-18']
i'll give him your number if i could just get calamari and caesar salad!:::['8-5-19']
i did not yell. i am not putting a dollar in the jar.:::['8-5-20']
wow, bing! burning the midnight oil. you know me, sir.:::['8-5-21']
oh, i have a question. do you know how can i get around the computer network......so i can access:::['8-5-22']
the really good internet porn?:::['8-5-23']
you're a joker, bing.:::['8-5-24']
what's funny about that?:::['8-5-25']
sorry i kept you waiting so long. that's okay. where do you wanna go?:::['8-5-26']
oh, uh, i think you know where i wanna go.:::['8-5-27']
the hard rock cafe? yeah.:::['8-5-28']
again? yeah.:::['8-5-29']
i'm telling you, i like the food. you like the purple rain display.:::['8-5-30']
hey, bob. hey, toby. have a good night.:::['8-5-31']
did that guy just call you toby? yeah, he thinks that's my name.:::['8-5-32']
why don't you correct him? oh, it's been way too long now.:::['8-5-33']
the first time, we were passing each other so i didn't say anything.:::['8-5-34']
the next time he said, "hey, toby, want a doughnut?":::['8-5-35']
and i wanted the doughnut.:::['8-5-36']
five years later, the doughnut's gone and i'm still toby.:::['8-5-37']
five years? chandler, you have to tell him. no, that would be so awkward.:::['8-5-38']
besides, we work in different departments. he's on the sixth floor.:::['8-5-39']
so he calls me toby once in a while. big deal. could be worse.:::['8-5-40']
it's not like he's calling me muriel.:::['8-5-41']
muriel. why would he call you muriel?:::['8-5-42']
chandler m. bing.:::['8-5-44']
it's not just an m. your middle name is muriel!:::['8-5-45']
shh! it is a family name.:::['8-5-46']
chandler muriel bing.:::['8-5-47']
your parents never even gave you a chance, did they?:::['8-5-48']
drake, i've discovered the reason for your headaches and memory loss.:::['8-5-49']
what is it?:::['8-5-50', '9-6-411', '7-11-228', '5-20-158', '4-12-315', '4-3-124']
apparently, your brain transplant was not entirely successful.:::['8-5-51']
it seems your body is rejecting jessica's brain.:::['8-5-52']
is it serious?:::['8-5-53']
not if we extract tissue from the original body......synthesize antibodies,introduce them into your system......which could stop you:::['8-5-54']
from rejecting the brain.:::['8-5-55']
that sounds simple enough. let's just do that.:::['8-5-56']
we would, but when we went to exhume jessica's body......it was gone.:::['8-5-57']
director: cut. very nice, people.:::['8-5-58']
let me change and we can go to dinner. wh...? oh.:::['8-5-59']
what happened to jessica's body? i'm not telling. you'll have to see it on tv.:::['8-5-60']
you don't know, do you? no. couldn't care less.:::['8-5-61']
hey, good scene, man. all right. you too.:::['8-5-62']
what? you weren't in it. oh...:::['8-5-63']
oh, sorry. uh, kash, this is my friend rachel. rachel, kash.:::['8-5-64']
hi. how come i haven't seen you here before?:::['8-5-65']
well, heh. joey probably just thinks i'll embarrass him.:::['8-5-66']
he thinks i'm some kind of soap opera nut. ha-ha-ha.:::['8-5-67']
which i'm not. i'm not. ha, ha.:::['8-5-68']
although, i do know your favorite ice cream flavor is butter pecan.:::['8-5-69']
and, uh... and your dog's name is wally.:::['8-5-70']
look at that, i'm just stroking your arm. here we go.:::['8-5-71']
we're leaving. bye, kash. say hi to wally.:::['8-5-72']
oh, monica. hi.:::['8-5-73']
oh, my god, i had the best time with tim last night. he is so sweet.:::['8-5-74']
ugh! i can't wait to get "sous-neath" him.:::['8-5-75']
uh, i... i have to fire him. why?:::['8-5-76']
because he's terrible. he's slow. he burns things.:::['8-5-77']
last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.:::['8-5-78']
he was nervous. you can be very intimidating.:::['8-5-79']
and i've met your pastry chef. she can stand to be taken down a peg.:::['8-5-80']
well, now she has no eyebrows. mission accomplished.:::['8-5-81']
but monica, he loves his job so much.:::['8-5-82']
can't you just give him another chance, please?:::['8-5-83']
all right. but if he lights someone else on fire, he is out of there.:::['8-5-84']
that's fair. thank you so much. thanks.:::['8-5-85']
oops, looks like when he got the pastry chef, he got you a little bit too.:::['8-5-86']
i paid to have this done.:::['8-5-87']
love it!:::['8-5-88']
hey. hi. oh, you know, uh, kash really liked you the other day.:::['8-5-89']
he said he thought you were charming. ha!:::['8-5-90']
i thought i was an idiot. i'm with you.:::['8-5-91']
he asked if you'd go out with him. oh! oh, i think i'm gonna throw up a little.:::['8-5-92']
what did you say? i said, "no." heh.:::['8-5-93']
i figured since you're pregnant, you're not gonna be seeing people.:::['8-5-95']
okay, joey.:::['8-5-96']
first of all, kash ford? not people.:::['8-5-97']
second, what did he say when you told him i was pregnant?:::['8-5-98']
i didn't. i didn't know if you were telling people. this was back when i thought kash was still "people.":::['8-5-99']
good. don't. just have him call me. i really don't think that's such...:::['8-5-100']
okay, you go do it. i'll come back to that set. i'll meet more actors. i'll meet them all. yup.:::['8-5-101']
hey, bob. hey! how's my pal toby doing today?:::['8-5-102']
if i see him, i'll ask. aah!:::['8-5-103']
hey, bing. was that bob from six you were just talking to?:::['8-5-104']
yeah. you know each other?:::['8-5-105']
we're on a semi-first-name basis.:::['8-5-106']
what do you think of adding him to our team? bob? ooh.:::['8-5-107']
working here with us? every day? yeah, i don't know if he has what it takes.:::['8-5-108']
really? they love him down on six. but this is 11.:::['8-5-109']
it's almost twice as hard up here.:::['8-5-110']
okay, i hear you loud and clear. bob will stay put. i think it's best, sir.:::['8-5-111']
we really do need to find somebody. work is starting to pile up.:::['8-5-112']
i've got a stack of documents on my desk this high.:::['8-5-113']
what you should do, toss them in the shredder... ...and claim you never got them.:::['8-5-114']
that's a good one, bing.:::['8-5-115']
what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here?:::['8-5-116']
hey. okay, i gave him another chance... ...but tim has got to go. but... no! no, no. he's totally incompetent.:::['8-5-117']
i called the chef who recommended him to me.:::['8-5-118']
he said, "ha, ha! gotcha!":::['8-5-119']
okay, but you can't fire him today. why not?:::['8-5-120']
because i'm dumping him today. what? you said he was sweet.:::['8-5-121']
he is sweet. he's too sweet. he calls me all the time.:::['8-5-122']
"did you get home from work okay? did you get out of the shower okay?":::['8-5-123']
just don't pick up your phone. then he comes over!:::['8-5-124']
"i was worried about you." ugh, be a man!:::['8-5-125']
so now i'm not allowed to fire him?:::['8-5-126']
you can't fire him and dump him in the same day. he'll kill himself.:::['8-5-127']
i fire him today, you go out with him another week.:::['8-5-128']
are you kidding? another week with that simp, i'll kill myself.:::['8-5-129']
then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it.:::['8-5-130']
okay. but the question is, who's gonna go first? whoever goes second is the bitch.:::['8-5-131']
what do you mean? the boss that fires a guy... ...that's just been dumped? bitch!:::['8-5-132']
and the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired?:::['8-5-133']
blond bitch!:::['8-5-134']
i wanted to do this days ago, so i think i should go first.:::['8-5-135']
ugh. all right, that makes sense.:::['8-5-136']
agh, but......screw you! i'm going first!:::['8-5-137']
hey, toby, you got a sec? sure, what's up?:::['8-5-138']
i just had a meeting. i was hoping to get transferred up here. but i found out it's not gonna happen.:::['8-5-139']
apparently somebody thinks i'm not "11 th-floor material.":::['8-5-140']
say, uh, who the hell is this chandler?:::['8-5-141']
what do you think is the better excuse for why i'm not drinking on this date?:::['8-5-142']
um, "i'm a recovering alcoholic," "i'm a mormon"......or "i got so hammered last night:::['8-5-143']
i'm still a little drunk"?:::['8-5-144']
hey. rachel: hi.:::['8-5-145', '9-1-108', '10-3-209', '10-3-263', '10-9-48', '2-15-175']
so, what do you want to do tonight?:::['8-5-146']
there's a ukrainian film at the angelika that's supposed to be very powerful.:::['8-5-147']
interested? no. no.:::['8-5-148']
but i'll go see a normal-person movie with you.:::['8-5-149']
rach, you wanna come? oh, no, i can't. i got a date.:::['8-5-150']
heh. a date? yeah. why, is that weird for you?:::['8-5-151']
why, no. it's the opposite of weird. it's, uh... it's regular. it's, uh...:::['8-5-152']
it's mundane. it's actually a little dull.:::['8-5-153']
it's no ukrainian film, i'll tell you.:::['8-5-154']
ooh! earrings!:::['8-5-155']
a date? she's got a date? with who? i set her up with this actor on my show.:::['8-5-156']
you set her up? no.:::['8-5-157']
joey, what were you thinking? that it would probably be okay......because ross hasn't gone out:::['8-5-158']
with rachel in five years.:::['8-5-159']
joey, i'm not worried about her. i'm worried about my baby. whoever she dates, my baby dates.:::['8-5-160']
where is this "actor" taking them? hey! i'm an "actor" too.:::['8-5-161']
i'm not sure. i think they're taking the ferry to some italian place on staten island.:::['8-5-162']
a ferry? my baby's going on a ferry? do you have any idea how dangerous those are?:::['8-5-163']
aren't we talking about those big boats that go, like, five miles an hour?:::['8-5-164']
why don't they just jump out of an airplane? that's a fun date. or burn each other with matches? that's fun too.:::['8-5-165']
whoo!:::['8-5-166', '9-11-169', '10-11-357', '10-10-246', '2-6-240', '5-1-337', '5-10-148', '3-9-333']
hey, joey. hey, kash. uh, hey, ross, this is kash. hey.:::['8-5-167']
hey, i hear you're going on a ferry tonight. yeah.:::['8-5-168']
bit of a daredevil, are we?:::['8-5-169']
hey, you guys, do you think this is too slutty? hi, kash.:::['8-5-170']
hey, rachel. you ready to go? yeah. see you guys later. okay. have a great time, you guys. rachel: thank you.:::['8-5-171']
and yes, it is too slutty!:::['8-5-172']
hi. ah!:::['8-5-173']
i'm so glad you called. i feel like it's always me calling you.:::['8-5-175']
so, what's up? is everything okay with phoebe?:::['8-5-176']
it will be in a minute. listen.:::['8-5-177']
tim, you're a really great guy. that's because i'm with you.:::['8-5-178']
i'm just... i'm in a place in my life right now where i...:::['8-5-180']
whoops! so sorry. "this just in." heh.:::['8-5-181']
it's 911 from the restaurant. that means monica needs me.:::['8-5-182']
oh, no, she doesn't! i know what that is. you can stay.:::['8-5-183']
aw...:::['8-5-184', '9-15-303', '7-4-93', '10-11-234']
i'll miss you too, pheebs.:::['8-5-185']
and i will be holding you right here.:::['8-5-186']
so, what movie do you wanna see? and not another one i have to read.:::['8-5-187']
i get enough of that from books.:::['8-5-188']
books? all right, car magazines, cereal boxes......but it's, like, enough!:::['8-5-189']
i tell you what, why don't we...? why don't we stay. let's not see a movie. we'll just hang.:::['8-5-190']
just wait for rachel to come back from her date? hey, if that's what you wanna do, i'm not gonna say no.:::['8-5-191']
dude, what is going on?:::['8-5-192']
i just... i have to find out how it went. why?:::['8-5-193']
this guy could be my baby's stepfather. they go on one date and you're worried about them getting married?:::['8-5-194']
he's not you.:::['8-5-195']
i just, i can't believe she's dating.:::['8-5-196']
what did you think she was gonna do? i don't know.:::['8-5-197']
i guess i can't believe any of this is happening. what do you mean?:::['8-5-198']
i always thought when i had another kid, it'd be different.:::['8-5-199']
i love ben. but every time i drop him off at carol and susan's......it breaks my heart a little.:::['8-5-200']
i've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on sunday.:::['8-5-201']
my kid comes running in, leaps up on the bed and we all read the paper together.:::['8-5-202']
you know? maybe fight over the science section.:::['8-5-203']
that's a nice picture. maybe you can still have that. no, i can't. rachel's out with some guy.:::['8-5-204']
my baby went with her.:::['8-5-205']
if anything, that picture keeps moving further away.:::['8-5-206']
hey, can i ask you something?:::['8-5-207', '8-12-260', '5-1-232']
in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife rachel?:::['8-5-208']
it used to be.:::['8-5-209']
now she doesn't really have a face.:::['8-5-210']
smoking body, though.:::['8-5-211']
good call. but the face, ross, the face isn't rachel.:::['8-5-212']
no. but, ugh, how much easier would it be if it were?:::['8-5-213']
i know, but i don't think that's what she wants.:::['8-5-214']
it's not what i want either. and i can't force myself to fall in love with her again.:::['8-5-215']
ross, maybe you need a new picture.:::['8-5-216']
okay? it's not gonna be what you thought. but no matter what......there's gonna be:::['8-5-217']
a brand-new little baby. your baby.:::['8-5-218']
who cares what the picture looks like?:::['8-5-219']
hey, tell you what. let's you and me go out and have some fun.:::['8-5-221']
huh? whatever you want. come on.:::['8-5-222']
we can catch that ukrainian film. no, i said fun.:::['8-5-223']
hey, toby? hey, bobby.:::['8-5-224']
it's bob, actually.:::['8-5-225']
you work up here. can you tell me where chandler bing's office is?:::['8-5-226']
uh, yeah, it's right...:::['8-5-227']
right there. let me ask you, why?:::['8-5-228']
ha, ha, i wanna talk to that bastard, see what his problem is.:::['8-5-229']
okay, bob, listen. uh...:::['8-5-230']
i'm the reason you didn't get the job.:::['8-5-231']
toby, don't. bob.:::['8-5-232']
toby, i'm not gonna let you cover for him.:::['8-5-233']
anything you say will just get me more upset with chandler.:::['8-5-234']
well that puts me in a difficult position.:::['8-5-235']
i got your page. is everything okay? uh, well, that depends.:::['8-5-236']
how are things with phoebe? it's great. thank you for introducing us.:::['8-5-237']
oh, my pleasure. okay, i'm afraid i've got some bad news.:::['8-5-238']
phoebe! monica!:::['8-5-239']
i'm breaking up with you! you're fired!:::['8-5-240']
what? i'm breaking up with you.:::['8-5-241']
you're fired. why?:::['8-5-242']
i'm sorry. i'm not ready for a relationship right now.:::['8-5-243']
and i'm sorry too. but, well, i like things done a certain way.:::['8-5-244']
and the chemistry's just not right. ooh, good. the chemistry thing for us too.:::['8-5-245']
wow, heh. um, okay. um...:::['8-5-246']
i realize i came on a little strong. but it's only because i think you're so amazing.:::['8-5-247']
and, uh...:::['8-5-248', '8-15-275', '2-8-17', '2-11-1']
i just wanna tell you how much i appreciate you giving me an opportunity here......because you're the most talented chef:::['8-5-249']
i've ever worked for.:::['8-5-250']
anyway, heh.:::['8-5-251']
tim, wait. wait. um... yeah?:::['8-5-252']
i think i spoke too quickly. there's a learning curve with this job.:::['8-5-253']
maybe we could try it again. really?:::['8-5-254']
thank you so much. because i know i can be better. okay.:::['8-5-255']
and tim, i just want to say good luck here.:::['8-5-256']
hello. ha, ha. hi.:::['8-5-257']
uh, how was the date?:::['8-5-258']
well, i'm alone and i just bought $15 worth of candy bars. what do you think?:::['8-5-259']
huh. what happened? made the mistake... ...of telling him that i was pregnant.:::['8-5-260']
he didn't, uh, take it so well? well, better than you.:::['8-5-261']
but still not what you want. oh?:::['8-5-262']
yeah. he got all weird and sputtery. then he said, uh::::['8-5-263']
"i hear those hemorrhoids are a bitch.":::['8-5-264']
he sounds swell. doesn't he?:::['8-5-265']
hey, you want a little cheering up? yes. okay. sit down.:::['8-5-266']
guess whose middle name is muriel?:::['8-5-267']
chandler m. bing. yu-huh. oh, my god.:::['8-5-268']
i'm sorry about your date. it's all right.:::['8-5-269']
i guess i'm just done with the whole dating thing.:::['8-5-270']
just one more thing in my life that is suddenly completely different.:::['8-5-271']
this is hard. yeah, i know.:::['8-5-272']
on the other hand, in, um... in about seven months you're gonna have something......that you're gonna love more than:::['8-5-273']
any guy you've ever gone out with.:::['8-5-274']
just wait. wait until, uh...:::['8-5-275']
wait until the first time your baby grabs your finger.:::['8-5-276']
you have no idea.:::['8-5-277']
thanks, sweetie.:::['8-5-278']
you wanna grab some coffee? no. i'm gonna go eat 10 candy bars.:::['8-5-279']
i thought i cheered you up. oh, you did. there are 20 in here. right.:::['8-5-280']
good night. good night.:::['8-5-281', '4-19-286']
ross? yeah? hey, it's mona. from the wedding.:::['8-5-282']
oh, hi! hi. wow, uh...:::['8-5-283']
how are you? i'm good, except, um... ...you still owe me a dance.:::['8-5-284']
oh, that's right. mm. well, uh, would you be interested in seeing a ukrainian film?:::['8-5-285']
oh, you're serious. sure.:::['8-5-286']
ross: great. well, uh...:::['8-5-287']
i think i might need one more cup of coffee. sure, uh, let me get it for you. okay.:::['8-5-288']
bob? bob!:::['8-5-289']
bob!:::['8-5-290']
what the hell are you doing? i just found out this is chandler's office.:::['8-5-291']
come on, toby. give me a hand!:::['8-5-292']
wait. before we go in, i just want you to know that i love you.:::['8-4-0']
and i had a great time on our honeymoon.:::['8-4-1']
i can't wait to go in there and spend the rest of our life together.:::['8-4-2']
you're sticking with the shell necklace, huh?:::['8-4-3']
hey, you're back! woo-hoo! yay!:::['8-4-4']
come on in! yeah, come on!:::['8-4-5']
how was the honeymoon?:::['8-4-6']
so much fun. the best part is, we met this incredible couple on the flight back.:::['8-4-7']
that was the best part? good honeymooning, tiger.:::['8-4-8']
they're cool. they were on their honeymoon too.:::['8-4-9']
they're terrific. they live here in the city.:::['8-4-10']
can we go call them? is it too soon to call? i wanna call.:::['8-4-11']
sorry, we're excited. we finally have a couple to hang out with.:::['8-4-12']
a couple? like two people? like one, two people?:::['8-4-13']
this is different. greg and jenny are in a relationship.:::['8-4-14']
ugh, greg and jenny. ugh! "hi, greg. i'm chandler. this is monica.":::['8-4-15']
"hi, monica. this is jenny." "hi, jenny. hi, greg.":::['8-4-16']
listen, they're great. if you got a chance... you know what?:::['8-4-17']
why don't you give us our souvenirs and get the hell out of here.:::['8-4-18']
we didn't get a chance to... you've got to be kidding me!:::['8-4-19']
we didn't get anything for anyone. mm-hm, yeah. nice necklace.:::['8-4-20']
that you can have.:::['8-4-21']
hi. monica: hey!:::['8-4-22']
hello! welcome home. so, how was the honeymoon?:::['8-4-23']
great! how about you? i mean, you're having a baby!:::['8-4-24']
oh, look, i have a sonogram picture. oh, good.:::['8-4-25']
ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.:::['8-4-26']
so now that ross knows, can you tell us how it happened? when did it happen? how many times did it happen?:::['8-4-27']
monica, that's not right. what? start with where.:::['8-4-28']
well, it happened about six weeks ago.:::['8-4-29']
and, uh, i had just got home from work and ross was already there.:::['8-4-30']
i guess he'd been hanging out with joey. you're welcome, buddy.:::['8-4-31']
and so i had a lot of work, and ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out.:::['8-4-33']
and then we had wine, we got to talking.:::['8-4-34']
next thing you know, out of nowhere ross comes on to me.:::['8-4-35']
um, heh. that's...:::['8-4-36']
that's a little misleading.:::['8-4-37']
what is? the lie you just told.:::['8-4-38']
that you came on to me? there's the one!:::['8-4-39']
but you did. let's be honest. yes, let's.:::['8-4-40']
you know what? uh, it's not important.:::['8-4-41']
heh, what's important is that we're having a baby. it doesn't matter who came on to who.:::['8-4-42']
"whom.":::['8-4-43']
you kissed me first. what? you were begging me to kiss you!:::['8-4-45']
you were sending me signals all over the place.:::['8-4-46']
i was sending signals? please. yeah. okay, anyone think that i'd actually send ross begging signals?:::['8-4-47']
please, show of hands.:::['8-4-48']
it doesn't matter what people "believe." what matters is what happened.:::['8-4-49']
these signals, explain this. maybe i need to be more careful. am i you sending these signals right now?:::['8-4-50']
you know what? just drop it. show me how i begged you.:::['8-4-51']
i can show you! i have it on videotape.:::['8-4-52']
it's an expression.:::['8-4-53', '2-1-82']
i can't believe he taped the two of them having sex.:::['8-4-54']
yeah. you gotta tell a girl before you tape her.:::['8-4-55']
such a rookie mistake.:::['8-4-56']
know who has a great camera? greg and jenny?:::['8-4-57']
do you want to call them? i want to. let's call.:::['8-4-58']
ask them if they brought their friends souvenirs.:::['8-4-59']
hello? 8th street deli?:::['8-4-60']
hey, hang up. you get food poisoning just talking to that place.:::['8-4-61']
sorry, wrong number. here you go, babe.:::['8-4-62']
hello? it's the deli again!:::['8-4-63']
all right, i'll have a sandwich.:::['8-4-64']
i don't think this number's right.:::['8-4-65']
what? you got fake-numbered.:::['8-4-66']
what? people don't do that. oh, i think we do.:::['8-4-67']
a fake number? why would they do that? i don't know.:::['8-4-68']
you were a delight to talk to. you asked those insightful, great questions.:::['8-4-69']
and you've never been funnier. i mean, joke, joke, joke! you were a hoot!:::['8-4-70']
don't worry about it. you still got me and phoebe.:::['8-4-71']
excuse me, i don't want greg and jenny's rejects.:::['8-4-72']
rachel won't talk to me. she won't open the door.:::['8-4-73']
hmm, i wonder why, pervert.:::['8-4-74']
okay, listen, i am not a pervert.:::['8-4-75']
that's, like, the pervert motto.:::['8-4-76']
yeah, they have you raise your right hand... ...put your left hand down your pants and repeat that.:::['8-4-77']
filming rachel was not something i planned.:::['8-4-78']
look, here's what happened. and joey can back me up on this.:::['8-4-79']
about a month and a half ago, remember i came to you with a problem?:::['8-4-80']
um, a...:::['8-4-81']
the personal thing?:::['8-4-82']
pers...? what personal thing? about... about sex?:::['8-4-83']
that i hadn't had sex in months?:::['8-4-84']
yeah, i knew what you were talking about.:::['8-4-85']
do you have a minute? i'd like to talk about something i'm uncomfortable talking about.:::['8-4-87']
sure, yeah.:::['8-4-88']
how about, uh, you showering with your mom?:::['8-4-89']
i actually had a topic in mind.:::['8-4-90']
i'm kind of going through a dry spell, sex-wise.:::['8-4-91']
oh, for, like, months? five, to be......lying. six.:::['8-4-92']
six months? that's rough.:::['8-4-93']
well, it's not all bad. i'm learning to appreciate the, uh, small things in life.:::['8-4-94']
like the sound of a bird, or the color of the sky.:::['8-4-95']
the sky's blue, ross. and i had sex yesterday.:::['8-4-96']
please help me. i have a date tonight.:::['8-4-97']
it has to go well. i'm scared for my health.:::['8-4-98']
okay, okay. oh! i got something. it's this story that i came up with.:::['8-4-99']
very romantic. any woman that hears it, they're like putty.:::['8-4-100']
really? tell it to me.:::['8-4-101']
okay. now, you're gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it.:::['8-4-102']
but you have to remember, it is just the story.:::['8-4-103']
i'll try to control myself. okay. ahem.:::['8-4-104']
years ago, when i was backpacking across western europe...:::['8-4-105']
heh, you were backpacking across europe?:::['8-4-106']
have a nice six more months, ross. okay, okay!:::['8-4-107']
i'm sorry. please, please. you were in western europe, and?:::['8-4-108']
i was outside barcelona, hiking in the foothills of mount tibidabo.:::['8-4-109']
i was at the end of this path. i came to a clearing, and there was a lake.:::['8-4-110']
very secluded. there were tall trees all around.:::['8-4-111']
it was dead silent. gorgeous.:::['8-4-112']
and across the lake i saw a beautiful woman bathing herself.:::['8-4-113']
but she was crying.:::['8-4-114']
mm! mm, this is great wine.:::['8-4-116']
it's from france.:::['8-4-117']
in europe.:::['8-4-118']
western europe.:::['8-4-119']
you know, um, a few years ago i was backpacking across western europe.:::['8-4-120']
really? mm-hm. wait, it gets better.:::['8-4-121']
um, yeah, i was in, um, barcelona.:::['8-4-122']
i studied for a year in barcelona.:::['8-4-123']
anyway, um, so i was hiking... i love hiking!:::['8-4-124']
oh, that's great!:::['8-4-125', '7-6-313']
i was hiking along the foothills of mount tibidaybo...:::['8-4-126']
i think it's "tibidabo." okay, do you want to tell the story?:::['8-4-127']
whoa, what are you doing here? how'd your date go?:::['8-4-128']
great. i'm across the street having sex right now.:::['8-4-129']
your story sucks. if it didn't work, you didn't tell it right.:::['8-4-130']
show me how you did it. no, i don't want to.:::['8-4-131']
how long since you seen a girl naked? i was backpacking across western europe.:::['8-4-132']
i'm not feeling it. i was outside barcelona, hiking...:::['8-4-133']
no, ross, i'm not hot. are you hot? it's been six months. i'm always hot.:::['8-4-134']
you're not selling the story. you don't believe it.:::['8-4-135']
i gotta go, i got a date. but try this.:::['8-4-136']
do what i do when i'm preparing for an audition.:::['8-4-137']
i'll set you up with my video camera. you can record yourself and see what you're doing wrong.:::['8-4-138']
i'll try that.:::['8-4-139']
all right. now, you're all set up. good to go. just hit record. good luck. thanks.:::['8-4-140']
and joe, listen. if you ever have any problem with the ladies... ...you know i'll help you out.:::['8-4-141']
that means a lot to me, man.:::['8-4-142']
can i get you anything? lens cleaner? your battery okay?:::['8-4-144']
rachel. oh, ross. hi. thank god you're here.:::['8-4-145']
you have to help me. were you just talking to yourself?:::['8-4-146']
that's less embarrassing. yes. yes, i was.:::['8-4-147']
ross: when she came in, i got distracted and totally forgot about the camera.:::['8-4-148']
it kept rolling and recorded everything.:::['8-4-149']
yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape. yeah.:::['8-4-150']
what a great idea! that'll get rachel to forgive me.:::['8-4-151']
this is not fair to her. let's forget the tape.:::['8-4-152']
you'll show it to me.:::['8-4-154']
no. you're right.:::['8-4-155']
joey, no. loud and clear.:::['8-4-156']
i don't get why greg and jenny would give us a fake number. you know, if they knew what they were doing......they didn't give you real names either.:::['8-4-157']
maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names.:::['8-4-159']
oh, yeah?:::['8-4-160', '7-10-294', '2-23-253', '4-2-200']
hi. ken adams. nice to meet you.:::['8-4-161']
regina phalange.:::['8-4-162']
we didn't do anything wrong. monica: i know.:::['8-4-163']
although you did tell an awful lot of jokes.:::['8-4-164']
i thought you said those jokes were funny. joke, joke, joke!:::['8-4-165']
joke, joke...:::['8-4-166']
maybe it was your questions. what about my questions?:::['8-4-167']
the sheer volume. it was like flying with the riddler.:::['8-4-168']
ooh, sorry, was that another joke? was that another question?:::['8-4-169']
hey, is ross still here? uh, no, rach, he's gone, but listen.:::['8-4-170']
he told us what happened. it sounds like an honest mistake.:::['8-4-171']
really? how would you like it if i had sex with you and i taped it?:::['8-4-172']
oh, forget it.:::['8-4-173', '5-8-9']
oh, there he is, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.:::['8-4-174']
look, it was an accident, okay?:::['8-4-175']
i feel bad it happened. i swear, i didn't even watch it.:::['8-4-176']
anyway, here.:::['8-4-177']
i thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself.:::['8-4-178']
you don't want to see this, do you? hell, yeah!:::['8-4-181']
i am not gonna show you this.:::['8-4-182']
not the sex part. just the stuff leading up to it.:::['8-4-183']
forget it. she's destroying it.:::['8-4-184']
okay, fine! fine. we'll just have to think of some other way... ...to put the "who came on to who" thing to rest.:::['8-4-185']
come on now, think!:::['8-4-186']
forget it. it's rachel's tape, and she can do whatever she wants with it.:::['8-4-187']
and she wants to destroy it, so end of story.:::['8-4-188']
i want to see it. what?:::['8-4-189']
clearly you don't want people to see this tape.:::['8-4-190']
i don't want people to see this tape either. but you so badly don't want people to see it that it makes me want to see it. see?:::['8-4-191']
are we watching the tape or not?:::['8-4-192']
i don't want people to see it for your sake. oh, i don't believe you.:::['8-4-193']
i think you don't want them to see you begging me.:::['8-4-194']
rachel, please? oh, a little preview.:::['8-4-195']
fine. but i want the record to show that i tried to take the high road.:::['8-4-196']
because in about five minutes, i'm gonna be saying::::['8-4-197']
hello. can i can get you anything?:::['8-4-199']
i'm so happy.:::['8-4-200']
rachel: oh, thank god you're here. i need you to help me. were you talking to yourself?:::['8-4-201']
oh, there i am. you're gonna get pregnant.:::['8-4-202']
rachel: i screwed up so bad.:::['8-4-203']
i told monica that i'd stuff and send those wedding invitations weeks ago.:::['8-4-204']
ross: you didn't do it?:::['8-4-205']
i had put them in... in my desk at work... ...and i forgot about them until today.:::['8-4-206']
sweetie, it's okay. everybody made it to the wedding. i'm fine.:::['8-4-207']
kind of hurting my hand though. i know.:::['8-4-208']
i can not believe that i did this. especially after monica just went on and on and on about it.:::['8-4-209']
"here are the invitations, rachel. be very careful, rachel.:::['8-4-210']
please drinking no liquids around the invitations, rachel.":::['8-4-211']
whoa, oh! oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!:::['8-4-212']
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!:::['8-4-213']
did you do it on our invitations?:::['8-4-214']
not on the ones we sent out.:::['8-4-215']
so just the ones you gave back to us and we had framed?:::['8-4-216']
can you believe this is happening? it seems like yesterday they got engaged. i know.:::['8-4-217']
remember the night they got engaged? how you and i almost...:::['8-4-218']
oh, i remember how we almost.:::['8-4-219']
you think we would've gone through with it if we hadn't gotten caught?:::['8-4-220']
you think we would have done it?:::['8-4-221']
i know i wanted to. i just wasn't sure if you wanted to.:::['8-4-222']
oh, i wanted to.:::['8-4-223']
so we... we both wanted to.:::['8-4-224']
interesting. mm.:::['8-4-225']
anyway, um, probably worked out for the best.:::['8-4-226']
in about 10 seconds, you're gonna see him kiss me.:::['8-4-228']
and in about 5 seconds, you're gonna see why.:::['8-4-229']
ross, did i ever tell you about the time... ...that i went backpacking through western europe?:::['8-4-230']
okay, get ready to see some begging.:::['8-4-231']
oh, you came on to ross!:::['8-4-232']
what? now i'm so happy.:::['8-4-233']
what are you talking about? you used the europe story!:::['8-4-234']
that's the magic story you use when you want to have sex!:::['8-4-235']
how do you know about that story? how do you know about that story?:::['8-4-236']
i heard it from my friend irene who heard it from some guy.:::['8-4-237']
some guy!:::['8-4-238']
no, no, she told me that his name was ken adams.:::['8-4-239']
ken adams!:::['8-4-240']
so apparently, uh, people are familiar with the europe story?:::['8-4-242']
yeah, listen, about that... ...the whole "who came on to who" thing really doesn't matter.:::['8-4-243']
i think it would have happened either way.:::['8-4-244']
i mean, if you hadn't initiated it, i know i would have.:::['8-4-245']
it was an amazing night. it was. it was an amazing night.:::['8-4-246']
you think it looked amazing?:::['8-4-247']
i, uh... i don't know. i honestly didn't watch it.:::['8-4-248']
yeah, me neither.:::['8-4-249', '4-23-122']
yet.:::['8-4-250']
that... that may be weird. yeah, it would be really weird.:::['8-4-252']
good luck. good luck to you.:::['8-4-253']
mind if i mute? oh, please.:::['8-4-254']
oh, there go the clothes. you are undressing awfully quickly.:::['8-4-255']

my student's helped me. i teach second grade.:::['8-6-115']
i love the second grade. really?:::['8-6-116']
it's better than first grade, where you don't know what's going on. and definitely better than third grade.:::['8-6-117']
you know, with all the politics and the mind games.:::['8-6-118']
so, what do you do? i'm a masseuse, by day.:::['8-6-119']
you don't have to stand here with me. i'm having fun.:::['8-6-120']

relax. what are you taking this so seriously for? it doesn't matter.:::['8-6-135']
really? what would you say if i told you ross or chandler could beat you up?:::['8-6-136']
i would say, "woman, please.":::['8-6-137']
hey, ursula's fiancé is really sweet.:::['8-6-138']
he's a teacher, he does volunteer work.:::['8-6-139']
normally, i don't like sweaty guys. but i could just mop him up.:::['8-6-140']
oh, my god, phoebe? what?:::['8-6-141']
you're getting a crush on your sister's fiancé. no, i'm not, you are!:::['8-6-142']

hi. hi, mona.:::['8-6-150']
oh, hey. hi.:::['8-6-151']
joey's gonna be thrilled. he was hoping you'd come by as a slutty nurse.:::['8-6-152']
um, actually, i'm just a nurse.:::['8-6-153']
you'd think that would embarrass me, but, you see, i'm maxed out.:::['8-6-154']
hey, you made it. hi! wait.:::['8-6-155']
you're, um... you're a potato? well, i'm a spud?:::['8-6-156']
and the antenna... oh, my god, you're spud-nik! yes!:::['8-6-157']
marry her.:::['8-6-158']
okay, here's a good one for you.:::['8-6-159']
who do you think would win a fight between ross and chandler?:::['8-6-160']
i can't answer that. chandler's my husband.:::['8-6-161']
so ross? yeah.:::['8-6-162']
hey, beautiful. hello, handsome.:::['8-6-163']
aw, look at you two. so when did you guys meet?:::['8-6-165']
two weeks ago. two weeks, that's it?:::['8-6-166']
i know. it sounds crazy, and it's not like me to do something impulsive.:::['8-6-167']
but she's so perfect, and we have so much in common. oh, really?:::['8-6-168']
we're both teachers. huh?:::['8-6-169']
and we were both in the peace corps. peace corps, really?:::['8-6-170']
in fact, when we were building houses in uruguay... ...we were just two towns apart and we never met.:::['8-6-171']
yeah. it wasn't a town when i got there, but it was a town when i left.:::['8-6-172']
shall we get me really drunk? sure.:::['8-6-173']
ha, ha. ugh.:::['8-6-174']
howdy, doodie.:::['8-6-175']
that's funny, yeah.:::['8-6-176']
you're the funniest man here in a bunny costume his wife made him wear.:::['8-6-177']
relax, man. relax. you're looking a little flushed.:::['8-6-178']
hey, i think we might find out the answer to our question.:::['8-6-179']
what question? who could kick whose ass in a fight... ...you or ross?:::['8-6-180']
there's no question. so you think ross too?:::['8-6-181']
you picked ross? ross is really strong.:::['8-6-182']
he's the strongest out of all three of you. except for joey.:::['8-6-183']
i can not believe you didn't pick me. in her defense, she's right. i am stronger.:::['8-6-184']
i would destroy you.:::['8-6-185']
oh, really? you think you're stronger? why don't you prove it?:::['8-6-186']
oh, i'll prove it. i'll prove it like a theorem!:::['8-6-187']
all right! okay, stop it. stop it!:::['8-6-188']
stop! no one's gonna fight.:::['8-6-189']
people came to see a fight, let's give them what they came for!:::['8-6-190']
you guys could arm-wrestle. yeah, listen to the slutty nurse.:::['8-6-191']
you're going down. oh, yeah? you're going further down.:::['8-6-192']
downtown!:::['8-6-193']
seriously, guys, the trash talk is embarrassing.:::['8-6-194']
oh, gunther, you brought candy. thank you so much for picking this up.:::['8-6-195']
you are so sweet. really?:::['8-6-196']
someday, you are gonna make some man the luckiest guy in the world.:::['8-6-197']

i'd rather have the money.:::['8-6-202']
well, that's not your choice. happy halloween!:::['8-6-203']

shut up!:::['8-6-206', '5-24-190']
you shut up!:::['8-6-207']

oh, wait! no. shut... don't cry!:::['8-6-213']

honey, you don't have to do this. it's the strength you have inside that means the most to me.:::['8-6-215']
you're loyal, you're honest and you have integrity.:::['8-6-216']
that's the strength i want in the man i love.:::['8-6-217']
that means nothing to me. come on!:::['8-6-218']
hi, liar. hey.:::['8-6-220']
you know, the only reason he's marrying you... ...is because he thinks the things you were saying were true.:::['8-6-221']
they could be true. but they're not.:::['8-6-222']
yeah. it's a fine line, huh?:::['8-6-223']
why are you lying to him? i don't know.:::['8-6-224']
he said he did this stuff, i said i did it too. he got so excited, it was fun.:::['8-6-225']
eric: honey?:::['8-6-226']
it's a disgusting habit, and i want you to quit now!:::['8-6-227']
she's helped so many people quit smoking.:::['8-6-228']
ursula: we'd better get going.:::['8-6-229']
you have a church group meeting. right.:::['8-6-230']
well, it was nice meeting you. you too.:::['8-6-231']

joey: come on!:::['8-6-239', '7-12-67']
wow, they're both really strong. or equally weak.:::['8-6-240']
oh, god. chandler's making his sex face.:::['8-6-241']
so you getting tired? no. i could do this all day.:::['8-6-242']
yeah. me too.:::['8-6-243', '8-7-98', '7-13-183']
getting a little tired, though. god, i'm exhausted.:::['8-6-244']
this is starting to look bad for me, okay? mona's standing right there.:::['8-6-245']
oh, god, she's talking to joey! you've got to let me win!:::['8-6-246']
no way. let me win. my wife thinks i'm a wimp.:::['8-6-247']
hey, at least you have a wife. i keep getting divorces and knocking people up.:::['8-6-248']
and i'm dressed as doodie.:::['8-6-249']
you're spud-nik. come on, who we kidding? i'm doodie.:::['8-6-250']
please? she's watching. ugh.:::['8-6-251']
fine. thanks.:::['8-6-252', '9-21-149']
oh, no. oh, yeah! yay!:::['8-6-253']
my hero!:::['8-6-254']
you're a weird lady.:::['8-6-255']
hey, ursula said she left her purse. oh.:::['8-6-256']
what a relief. it has the numbers of the people in her prayer chain.:::['8-6-257']
i'm sure it does. yeah. yeah.:::['8-6-258']
well, guess i'll see you at the wedding.:::['8-6-259']
um, listen. i don't think i'm gonna make it to the wedding.:::['8-6-260']
i wish you all the luck in the world. we'll be okay.:::['8-6-261']
it's so perfect, and she's been saving herself for me.:::['8-6-262']
i can't let you do this. she's lying to you. what?:::['8-6-263']
she is lying. and i bet i could prove it. excuse me.:::['8-6-264']
okay. yeah, not a prayer chain.:::['8-6-265']
but what looks like a detailed drawing of a bank floor plan.:::['8-6-266']
here's the name tag from the restaurant where she works as a waitress.:::['8-6-267']
not a teacher, a waitress.:::['8-6-268']
here's her driver's license. she always lies about this.:::['8-6-269']
how old did she say she was? she told me she was 25.:::['8-6-270']
aw. i almost don't want to show you this.:::['8-6-271']
just remember, i'm a minute younger.:::['8-6-272']
i am so stupid.:::['8-6-273']
of course she's lying. she's not a teacher.:::['8-6-274']
there's no such thing as a "top secret school for the children of spies.":::['8-6-275']
no, you're not stupid.:::['8-6-276']
i'm not smart.:::['8-6-277']
i just wanted so much to be impulsive for once.:::['8-6-278']
to be romantic. that's good.:::['8-6-279']
you should be impulsive and you should be romantic.:::['8-6-280']
just, you did it with the wrong person.:::['8-6-281']
what? it's weird, two people look so alike.:::['8-6-282']
and so different.:::['8-6-283']
ursula: eric! let's go!:::['8-6-284']
better go deal with it. yeah, you should.:::['8-6-285']
ursula: hurry up! i gotta pray!:::['8-6-286']
well, i had to give the kid 50 bucks to stop crying.:::['8-6-288']
that's not so bad. i also had to go to a couple houses......as his girlfriend.:::['8-6-289']
ugh, i am just awful with children.:::['8-6-290']
come on, you're good with kids. they're just crazy on halloween.:::['8-6-291']
they're all greedy, hopped up on sugar.:::['8-6-292']
really? that's all it is? absolutely.:::['8-6-293']
halloween is the worst. except for christmas. and their birthdays.:::['8-6-294']
they get crazy during the summer too.:::['8-6-295']
and any time they're hungry or sleepy.:::['8-6-296']
kids are tough. good luck with that. pfft.:::['8-6-297']
look, i wanted to tell you, i'm sorry you lost.:::['8-6-298']
oh, listen. i got a secret for you. i let him win.:::['8-6-299']
heh, heh. was that a secret, or a lie?:::['8-6-300']
no, i let him... ross? yeah?:::['8-6-301']
would you tell her i let you win, please?:::['8-6-302']
oh, yeah, uh, chandler let me win.:::['8-6-303']
no, chandler's really strong. oh, my arm is so sore. oh, nurse?:::['8-6-304']
i am strong. i'll show you.:::['8-6-305']
chandler, please.:::['8-6-306']
oh, what's the matter? are you scared?:::['8-6-307']
let's go, big bunny!:::['8-6-308']
one, two, three. go!:::['8-6-309']
i'm gonna kill myself.:::['8-6-310']
oh, my god, you cleaned! look at these floors!:::['8-7-0']
you did the windows! i have been begging for months and you did, you cleaned!:::['8-7-1']
and nagging works! no, uh, i didn't actually do this.:::['8-7-2']
oh, no. was i cleaning in my sleep again?:::['8-7-3']
no, it wasn't you.:::['8-7-4']
well, then, who? i got a maid. yay!:::['8-7-5']
oh, well, i hope by "maid," you mean "mistress"... ...because if some other woman was cleaning...:::['8-7-6']
now, honey, i know you don't like to relinquish control.:::['8-7-7']
"relinquish" is just a fancy word for "lose.":::['8-7-8']
look, she's really nice, okay? and she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.:::['8-7-9']
did she really say that?:::['8-7-10']
yes, i distinctly remember because i thought it was a joke.:::['8-7-11']
now, just give her a chance, okay? fine, i can do it.:::['8-7-12']
what's the matter? usually when i'm anxious, i clean.:::['8-7-14']
whose cell phone is that? it's just so annoying.:::['8-7-15']
everywhere you go. i think it's coming from your bag.:::['8-7-16']
i never get calls!:::['8-7-17']
hi, it's eric, from the halloween party. ursula's fiancé.:::['8-7-19']
oh, my god, eric, hi! wait, how'd you get this number?:::['8-7-20']
i have a friend who's a cop, and he got it.:::['8-7-21']
wow. what an incredible violation and wonderful surprise!:::['8-7-22']
i just... i thought you should know i broke up with ursula.:::['8-7-23']
oh, you did? he did it, he did it!:::['8-7-24']
wow, what did he do? shh! i'm talking.:::['8-7-25']
anyway, i was wondering... ...if you were the sort of person who eats lunch?:::['8-7-26']
are you asking me out?:::['8-7-27']
because it'd be weird since you just broke up with my sister.:::['8-7-28']
yeah, um, okay.:::['8-7-29']
i'm sorry. bye.:::['8-7-30']
no, wait! i was just saying that so you'd think i was a good person.:::['8-7-31']
fight for me!:::['8-7-32']
uh, i won't take no for an answer.:::['8-7-33']
not great, we can work on it at lunch.:::['8-7-34']
okay, um, i can be at your apartment in two hours.:::['8-7-35']
great. uh, how do you know where i live?:::['8-7-36']
i've got friends too.:::['8-7-37']
okay, bye. bye.:::['8-7-38']
oh, my god, i'm going out with eric!:::['8-7-39']
oh, this day is gonna be much better than i thought it was gonna be. heh.:::['8-7-40']
oh, ross, i can't make lunch.:::['8-7-41']
so apparently i'm available for lunch.:::['8-7-42']
can't, i'm busy. i'm apartment hunting.:::['8-7-43']
you're moving?:::['8-7-44']
i can't live with joey once the baby comes.:::['8-7-45']
i don't want my child's first words to be, "how you doing?":::['8-7-46']
so does joey know you're moving?:::['8-7-47']
i haven't discussed it, but he's gonna be relieved.:::['8-7-48']
last week he brought this girl over... ...and i started talking to her about morning sickness.:::['8-7-49']
then i showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.:::['8-7-50']
that's not really porn. not so much.:::['8-7-51']
you know what? if you're looking for a place... ...i heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.:::['8-7-52']
oh, my god. was she old? does she have a view?:::['8-7-53']
well i don't know. but how great would that be, huh? you living in my building?:::['8-7-54']
i could take care of the baby, i could come over whenever i want......with your permission.:::['8-7-55']
that really would be great. yeah. well, can we see it?:::['8-7-56']
oh, maybe we shouldn't. if she just died this morning. out of respect.:::['8-7-57']
yeah. no. no, you're right.:::['8-7-58']
shall we? yeah.:::['8-7-59']
yes? hi. i'm ross geller.:::['8-7-60']
i live in the building.:::['8-7-61']
and i'm rachel, an admirer of the building.:::['8-7-62']
i heard about mrs. verhoeven passing away, and i am so sorry for your loss.:::['8-7-63']
she didn't pass away. what?:::['8-7-64']
my mother's still alive. oh, thank god!:::['8-7-65']
it looked like we were gonna lose her this morning... ...but she's a tough old bird. both: aww.:::['8-7-66']
are you close with her?:::['8-7-67']
of course. heh. uh, yeah. she and i would talk all the time......in the laundry room.:::['8-7-68']
you speak dutch?:::['8-7-69']
you know, i would, but it's just too painful.:::['8-7-70']
so she's really not dead.:::['8-7-71']
no. she's hanging in there. mm.:::['8-7-72']
do you think...? could you tell me, is she hanging in in a one-bedroom or a two?:::['8-7-73']
mrs. bing, this tile cleaner is incredible. where did you get it?:::['8-7-74']
oh, well, um, i make it myself.:::['8-7-75']
it's two parts ammonia and one part lemon juice. the secret ingredient is...:::['8-7-76']
you know what? we just met.:::['8-7-77']
okay. uh, i'm gonna get the clothes from the laundry room now......and when i come back,i'll clean behind the fridge.:::['8-7-78']
i love her.:::['8-7-79', '5-14-307']
i'll be back in a minute.:::['8-7-80']
see? i told you. she stole my jeans!:::['8-7-82']
i have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them.:::['8-7-84']
so she stole your pants... ...and then she came back and wore them in front of you?:::['8-7-85']
don't you see? it's the perfect crime.:::['8-7-86']
she must have been planning this for years.:::['8-7-87']
i will prove it to you.:::['8-7-88']
about a week ago, i was wearing those jeans. i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch.:::['8-7-89']
when she comes back, i will find it and show you that stain!:::['8-7-90']
is it possible the company that sold the jeans... ...made more than just the one pair?:::['8-7-91']
i guess.:::['8-7-92', '9-11-336', '10-4-287', '10-6-203', '2-16-333', '4-20-212']
so shouldn't we give her the benefit of the doubt before we go... ...snooping around her crotch?:::['8-7-93']
fine. i'm just glad i didn't give her my secret ingredient.:::['8-7-94']
heh. out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?:::['8-7-95']
yeah. ha-ha-ha.:::['8-7-96', '2-8-96']
hi. come in. i'm so glad you're here.:::['8-7-97']
not in the shaky, angry way you are, though.:::['8-7-99']
sorry. i just saw ursula. i had to get the engagement ring back. ugh.:::['8-7-100']
just seeing her brought it all back.:::['8-7-101']
all the lies, the way she used me.:::['8-7-102']
i just... i get so angry, just looking at her...:::['8-7-103']
face. yeah. yeah.:::['8-7-104']
i'm sorry. it's just, when i look at you......i see her.:::['8-7-105']
and when i see her, i get a little bit angry.:::['8-7-106']
maybe this is too weird. no, wait.:::['8-7-107']
there's only a problem... ...when i look at you.:::['8-7-108']
i got it. i got it.:::['8-7-109']
no, don't tear out your eyes!:::['8-7-110']
i was just gonna take out my lenses. oh, yeah. try that.:::['8-7-111']
so is that better?:::['8-7-112', '5-5-251']
you... ugh. you're blurry. but you still look like ursula. you're "blursula.":::['8-7-114']
okay, wait. maybe...:::['8-7-115']
if i just don't look at you for a while.:::['8-7-116']
see? it works. i'm not angry at all anymore. this is a great date!:::['8-7-117']
look, eric, turn around.:::['8-7-118']
look, i like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. it's our first date.:::['8-7-119']
first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity.:::['8-7-120']
and "ooh, he touched my hand, did he mean touch my hand?" and, you know, first kisses, and......second kisses.:::['8-7-121']
thanks for the coffee, or, uh, ahem::::['8-7-122']
yeah, we're done.:::['8-7-123']
"ezel"? ezel...:::['8-7-124']
hey, ross. listen. you wanna go see that new imax movie on tide pools?:::['8-7-125']
really? no, ha, ha.:::['8-7-126']
but i got knicks tickets for you, me, and chandler.:::['8-7-127']
sweet! all right, finish your coffee. let's go.:::['8-7-128']
i have to stop by my place.:::['8-7-129']
to tape the game? you do this every time. you're not gonna be on tv!:::['8-7-130']
no, no, i have to see if this apartment became available.:::['8-7-131']
you're switching apartments? not for me, it's for rachel.:::['8-7-132']
rachel has an apartment. when the baby comes, she's gonna move.:::['8-7-133']
she is? yeah.:::['8-7-134']
you didn't expect her to live there with a baby, did you?:::['8-7-135']
i guess i didn't really think about it.:::['8-7-136']
ezel.:::['8-7-137']
hey, gunther, you're an ezel. huh.:::['8-7-138']
nice jeans. oh, thanks.:::['8-7-140']
i like your top. oh. you're not getting it.:::['8-7-141']
what happened? oh. i fell asleep.:::['8-7-142']
i was thinking about taking my lunch break.:::['8-7-143']
will you do the top of the cabinets? that'll really work up your appetite.:::['8-7-144']
i'm sorry. i've never had a maid before. is this not okay?:::['8-7-148']
how was the game? uh, it was okay. i ate way too much.:::['8-7-150']
mm. ooh.:::['8-7-151', '8-7-174']
so, um, i was talking to ross and he said you were looking for a new place?:::['8-7-152']
oh, yeah. hopefully across the street. if certain dutch people would just let go.:::['8-7-153']
i was kind of hoping you'd stay.:::['8-7-154']
but joey, i have to go. there's no room for a baby here.:::['8-7-155']
no room? it's a baby. it's, like, this big.:::['8-7-156']
you could put it over here.:::['8-7-157']
or we could put it right here. aw! cute, right?:::['8-7-158']
or over here. you wouldn't even notice it.:::['8-7-159']
"where's the baby?" "oh, it's right over...":::['8-7-160']
honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it.:::['8-7-161']
a baby changes everything. they cry all the time.:::['8-7-162']
imagine bringing home some girl... ...and trying to score when there's a screaming baby.:::['8-7-163']
i could use a challenge. it's getting pretty easy.:::['8-7-164']
it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but i can't do that to you.:::['8-7-165']
i mean, it would disrupt your entire life.:::['8-7-166']
i love living with you so much.:::['8-7-168']
i wish things didn't have to change. i know.:::['8-7-169']
you know, i blame ross for this.:::['8-7-170']
i do too, a little bit. yeah.:::['8-7-171']
you're the hottest roommate i ever had.:::['8-7-173']
oh, no, i have to go. ugh, i have a massage appointment.:::['8-7-175']
no, stay here. we'll keep doing this. i'll pay you.:::['8-7-176']
no, i've gotten in trouble for that before.:::['8-7-177']
i'll see you later? absolutely.:::['8-7-178']
i love the way you kiss.:::['8-7-179']
really? that's the thing i'm worst at! heh, you'll see.:::['8-7-180']
hey. hey! um...:::['8-7-181']
i think brenda needs a raise. how come?:::['8-7-182']
because i put my head between her legs.:::['8-7-183']
to see her pants? they're my pants!:::['8-7-184']
are you sure? did you see the stain?:::['8-7-185']
no. i was getting into position, and everything went dark.:::['8-7-186']
god, she is not stealing from us, okay? will you let this go?:::['8-7-187']
she's wearing my bra! oh, dear god.:::['8-7-189']
my pink flowered bra! i recognize the strap!:::['8-7-190']
and yet you don't recognize that you're crazy?:::['8-7-191']
here's the plan, okay? i'm going to leave, and you're gonna look at brenda's bra.:::['8-7-192']
here's another plan. no.:::['8-7-193']
i would do it, but she thinks i'm attracted to her.:::['8-7-194']
why? did you not hear where my head was?:::['8-7-195']
come on! we're a team. we're in this together.:::['8-7-196']
i fear a jury will see it the same way.:::['8-7-197']
do this for me. i catch you looking at women's breasts all the time.:::['8-7-198']
you see that?:::['8-7-199']
do you see this? unh...:::['8-7-200']
all right. yes, okay. i get your point.:::['8-7-201']
but if it's not her bra, will you just let the woman clean?:::['8-7-202']
yes. absolutely. okay? you'll know it's mine because on the right cup, the lacy part... ...there's very a noticeable rip.:::['8-7-203']
you need new clothes.:::['8-7-204']
hi. how is she? it's not looking good.:::['8-7-205']
oh? oh. aw.:::['8-7-206']
well, i, uh, brought her some bloemen.:::['8-7-207']
that's so sweet. would you like to say goodbye? i'm sure it would mean a lot to her.:::['8-7-208']
oh, i don't know that it would. heh.:::['8-7-209']
well, her memory is pretty much gone. all right, then.:::['8-7-210']
hey! welcome back.:::['8-7-211']
should we pick up from where we left off? i don't know. i'm still tired from this afternoon.:::['8-7-212']
why? uh, the sex.:::['8-7-213']
what sex? our sex.:::['8-7-214']
we didn't have sex.:::['8-7-215']
well if i didn't have sex with you... ...i had sex with somebody that looked an awful lot like...:::['8-7-216']
ew. ew. ew, ew! eric: no, no, no, no!:::['8-7-217']
you had sex with ursula? a little bit.:::['8-7-218']
she walked in, i thought she was you and i kissed her and...:::['8-7-219']
you didn't notice different clothes? i was just so excited to see you. aw.:::['8-7-220']
ew! ew! ew!:::['8-7-221']
ugh! you know what? this is too weird.:::['8-7-222']
no. i don't wanna lose you. it's like i was saying to ursula... ...when i was making love to her and thought she was you...:::['8-7-223']
yeah. it's too weird.:::['8-7-224']
so i guess this is it.:::['8-7-225']
maybe it's for the best.:::['8-7-227']
you smell just like her. yeah, so do you.:::['8-7-228']
what are you doing? i'm leaning.:::['8-7-229']
this is where i lean.:::['8-7-230']
brenda, a bee! what?:::['8-7-232']
yes, it's flown into your blouse. you better undo your buttons lest it sting you.:::['8-7-233']
i think i know what's going on here. you do?:::['8-7-234']
look, i know it must be hard that your wife is a lesbian......but it's wrong. you're married.:::['8-7-235']
i totally understand. okay, good. ha-ha-ha.:::['8-7-236']
could i just see your bra?:::['8-7-237']
where'd you get those jeans? you gave them to me.:::['8-7-239']
no, i didn't! all right, i took them.:::['8-7-240']
i figured it was okay, you've got an ink stain on the crotch.:::['8-7-241']
oh, no! did you take my bra too? what bra?:::['8-7-242']
the pink one with the flowers. you mean the one you're wearing?:::['8-7-243']
i quit!:::['8-7-244', '7-3-245']
sounds about right.:::['8-7-245']
what is this? hey.:::['8-7-246']
uh, this is just to give you an idea.:::['8-7-247']
we can put screens here so the baby has privacy......and maybe a mobile,you know, over the crib......and, uh, here's a baby monitor which,until the baby comes......we can use as walkie-talkies. eh?:::['8-7-248']
you're so sweet!:::['8-7-249']
oh, my god! and you gave the baby hugsy!:::['8-7-250']
that's really just to show where the baby would go.:::['8-7-252']
why don't i hold on to him so there's no confusion?:::['8-7-253']
joey, the baby is gonna be crying. it's gonna be loud.:::['8-7-254']
i'm loud. it's gonna be up all night.:::['8-7-255']
i'm up all night. it's gonna poop.:::['8-7-256']
what about the women you wanna bring home?:::['8-7-258']
look, if i'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby......then maybe i don't wanna:::['8-7-259']
be with that woman.:::['8-7-260']
or maybe we'll do it in the bathroom of the club!:::['8-7-261']
joey, are you sure? yeah.:::['8-7-262']
look, i know sometimes it'll be hard, okay......but it'll also be really,really great.:::['8-7-263']
please, rachel, i really want you to stay.:::['8-7-264']
i want me to stay too. thank you. aw.:::['8-7-265']
joey, look at this crib! it's so cute! i know. i found it on the street.:::['8-7-266']
are you...? really? this is in such good condition. yeah.:::['8-7-267']
wow. whoa, what's under the cover?:::['8-7-268']
i don't know. it's moving.:::['8-7-269']
ew. still...:::['8-7-270']
aah! it's got a tail! get it out! oh, aah! okay!:::['8-7-271']
well, the old lady died. and how do i know?:::['8-7-272']
because her dying wish was for one last kiss.:::['8-7-273']
but i don't care because you got the apartment. yes!:::['8-7-274']
ew, yeah.:::['8-7-275']
um, i think i'm gonna stay here.:::['8-7-276']
isn't that great?:::['8-7-277', '5-4-277']
ezels!:::['8-7-278']
hey, i got you a present!:::['8-12-0']
oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?:::['8-12-1']
i got it for your wedding, i ordered it weeks ago and it finally got here!:::['8-12-2']
pheebs, you didn't have to get us anything for our...:::['8-12-3']
i love it! it's huge! let's open it! open it!:::['8-12-4']
it's a ms. pac-man machine! oh, my god!:::['8-12-5']
i didn't know where to put it so i left.:::['8-12-6']
we can put it in the guest bedroom. yeah, okay.:::['8-12-7']
i kind of like it here. do you really like it?:::['8-12-8']
are you kidding? i practically spent my entire childhood at the arcade.:::['8-12-9']
this was, like, my second favorite game. what was your first?:::['8-12-10']
i don't really remember the name of it. well, what did it do?:::['8-12-11']
well, you'd put a quarter in, pull some handles and win a candy bar.:::['8-12-12']
a vending machine?:::['8-12-13']
hey, don't feel bad for me. i won every time!:::['8-12-14']
hey! i'm so glad you guys are here.:::['8-12-15']
i've been dying to tell someone what happened in the paleontology department.:::['8-12-16']
do you think he saw us, or can we still slip out?:::['8-12-17']
professor newman, the head of the department, is retiring, so...:::['8-12-18']
they made you head of the department! no, i get to teach his advanced class!:::['8-12-19']
why didn't i get head of the department?:::['8-12-20']
oh, hey, rach, listen, um... yeah.:::['8-12-21']
i got a big date. do you know a good restaurant?:::['8-12-22']
uh, paul's cafe. it's got great food and it's really romantic.:::['8-12-23']
ooh. great, thanks.:::['8-12-24']
and then after, you could take her to the four seasons for drinks.:::['8-12-25']
or go downtown and listen to some jazz.:::['8-12-26']
or dancing. oh, take her dancing!:::['8-12-27']
you sure are naming a lot of ways to postpone sex, i'll tell you.:::['8-12-28']
agh, i miss dating. getting dressed up, going to a fancy restaurant.:::['8-12-29']
i'm not gonna be able to do that for so long. and it's so much fun.:::['8-12-30']
not that sitting at home worrying about giving birth to a 16-pound baby is not fun.:::['8-12-31']
hey, you know what? why don't i take you out?:::['8-12-32']
what? you don't want to go on a date with a pregnant lady.:::['8-12-33']
yes, i do. we're gonna go out, we're gonna have a good time.:::['8-12-34']
i'll take your mind off of childbirth, and c-sections......and giant baby heads stretching out...:::['8-12-35']
okay, i'll go with you. i'll go.:::['8-12-36']
it will be fun. all right. okay.:::['8-12-37']
no, no! yes!:::['8-12-38']
aw, would you look at that, monica?:::['8-12-39']
i knocked off all your top scores. how sad.:::['8-12-40']
okay, i'm next.:::['8-12-41']
no, don't start another game. i'm next! phoebe?:::['8-12-42']
i'm sorry, i couldn't hear you over all the winning.:::['8-12-43']
chandler! phoebe's hogging the game. who cares? it's a stupid game.:::['8-12-44']
oh, you only think it's stupid because you suck at it.:::['8-12-45']
i don't suck. it sucks.:::['8-12-46']
you suck.:::['8-12-47']
if this game is gonna cause problems between you......maybe i should keep it.:::['8-12-48']
no, i love it. it is a great present.:::['8-12-49']
in fact, why don't you go home and wait for the "thank you" card?:::['8-12-50']
why do you want to play so badly? yeah, it's not like it spits out......a clark bar after every game.:::['8-12-51']
okay. phoebe, that's it. out of the chair. come on. out of the chair.:::['8-12-52']
phoebe!:::['8-12-53', '8-12-278', '9-8-146', '7-7-124']
joey, could you get that?:::['8-12-54']
ugh, joey...:::['8-12-55']
what? i thought you were in your room.:::['8-12-56']
no, i'm picking you up for our date. these are for you.:::['8-12-57']
oh, lilies. they're my favorite. thank you.:::['8-12-58']
and a brownie.:::['8-12-59']
well, half a brownie.:::['8-12-60']
actually, it's just a bag.:::['8-12-61']
it's a long walk from the flower shop and i was starting to feel faint, so...:::['8-12-62']
oh, man, this is so great!:::['8-12-63']
i actually feel like i'm going on a real date.:::['8-12-64']
with a hint of morning sickness and i'm wearing underwear that goes up to about......there.:::['8-12-65']
hey, come on. this is a real date. uh...:::['8-12-66']
so, nice place you got here.:::['8-12-67']
foosball, huh? pizza box.:::['8-12-68']
oh, a subscription to playboy. my kind of woman.:::['8-12-69']
actually, that's my roommate's.:::['8-12-70']
i'd like to meet him. he sounds like a standup guy.:::['8-12-71']
but he's very protective of me......so you'd better watch yourself.:::['8-12-72']
hey, so, this roommate of yours, is he good-looking?:::['8-12-74']
mm-hm. oh, yeah.:::['8-12-75']
must be tough to keep your hands off him. ha, ha.:::['8-12-76']
yeah, but i'm pretty sure he's gay.:::['8-12-77']
no! no, he's not! why are you trying to ruin the game?:::['8-12-78']
which brings us back, of course, to greely's theory of dominance.:::['8-12-79']
that's it for today.:::['8-12-80']
oh, uh, does anyone know where the freeman building is?:::['8-12-81']
yeah, it's the new building on avenue a.:::['8-12-82']
what? that's across town.:::['8-12-83']
i'm supposed to teach a seminar there in 10 minutes.:::['8-12-84']
ooh, dude, that's not gonna happen.:::['8-12-85']
ross: move it. move it. move it!:::['8-12-86']
hey! i'm the teacher!:::['8-12-87']
sorry i'm a little late. uh...:::['8-12-89']
whoa, a lot late.:::['8-12-90']
uh, well, let me start by, uh, introducing myself.:::['8-12-91']
i'm, uh, professor geller.:::['8-12-92']
so to sum up......i'm professor geller. good job today.:::['8-12-93']
now, the filet mignon, what comes with that?:::['8-12-94']
a side of steamed vegetables.:::['8-12-95']
instead of the vegetables......is there any way that i could:::['8-12-97']
substitute the, um......three-pound lobster?:::['8-12-98']
you know what? bring her both.:::['8-12-99']
and i'll have the same.:::['8-12-100']
wow, this is shaping up to be a pretty good date.:::['8-12-101']
oh, i almost forgot. i didn't pay you the rent.:::['8-12-102']
whoa, whoa, whoa, no roommate stuff. we're on a date.:::['8-12-103']
okay. wow, so i get to see what joey tribbiani is like on a date.:::['8-12-104']
do you have any moves?:::['8-12-105']
no, i'm just myself, and if they don't like me for...:::['8-12-106']
i'm sorry, i couldn't even get through that.:::['8-12-107']
i knew it. come on, tell me your moves.:::['8-12-108']
uh, all right. um...:::['8-12-109']
i start by having a bottle of wine sent to my table from a fan.:::['8-12-111']
oh, my god. and that works?:::['8-12-112']
it does when you combine it with, "this is embarrassing.:::['8-12-113']
i just want to have a normal life.":::['8-12-114']
aw, you poor little famous man. mm-hm.:::['8-12-115']
oh, okay, how about this one?:::['8-12-116']
i was gonna wait until the end of the night to kiss you......but you're just so beautiful,i don't think i can.:::['8-12-117']
oh, my god! ha.:::['8-12-118']
wow, that was fantastic! i almost leaned in. i really almost did.:::['8-12-119']
all right, so tell me one of your moves.:::['8-12-120']
all right. ahem.:::['8-12-121']
so where'd you grow up?:::['8-12-122']
that's your move?:::['8-12-123']
boy, rach, you're lucky you're hot.:::['8-12-124']
come on, just answer the question. ugh. queens.:::['8-12-125']
and so were you close to your parents?:::['8-12-126']
with my mom. not so much my dad. why not?:::['8-12-127']
i don't know. i guess there's just always been this distance.:::['8-12-128']
i mean, we both try to pretend it's not there, but it is.:::['8-12-129']
it's gotta be rough.:::['8-12-131']
it is. yeah, it's really tough. you know, sometimes i think...:::['8-12-132']
nice move! uh-huh.:::['8-12-134']
"where'd you grow up?" so simple. thank you.:::['8-12-135']
ha, ha. now, excuse me. i'm gonna go to the restroom.:::['8-12-136']
and now you're watching me walk away. yes, i am! again, so simple.:::['8-12-137']
you're not gonna believe what i did today. clearly wasn't showering or shaving.:::['8-12-139']
i got good. i played this game all day, and now i rule at it.:::['8-12-140']
they should change the name of it to "ms. chandler.":::['8-12-141']
although, i hope they don't.:::['8-12-142']
you stayed home all day and played ms. pac-man......while i went off to work:::['8-12-143']
like some chump?:::['8-12-144']
uh-huh. i got the top ten scores. i erased phoebe off the board. high-five!:::['8-12-145']
what is the matter with your hand?:::['8-12-146']
i been playing for eight hours.:::['8-12-147']
it'll loosen up. come on, check out the scores.:::['8-12-148']
and also, look at the initials. they're dirty words.:::['8-12-149']
chandler, why would you do that? because it's awesome.:::['8-12-150']
you think this is clever?:::['8-12-151']
they only give you three letters, so after a-s-s, it is a challenge.:::['8-12-152']
this one's not dirty. it is when you put it together with that one.:::['8-12-153']
if you don't clear this off, you won't get one of those from me.:::['8-12-155']
ben's coming over here tomorrow. this can't be there.:::['8-12-156']
he won't know what they mean. he's 7, not stupid.:::['8-12-157']
have you talked to him lately? look, i'm gonna unplug it.:::['8-12-158']
no, no! i'll have nothing to show for my day.:::['8-12-159']
it'll be like i was at work.:::['8-12-160']
hey, look! it's still there!:::['8-12-162']
this thing must have some kind of primitive rom chip in it or something!:::['8-12-163']
you gotta beat your scores. with the claw?:::['8-12-164']
fine, i'll do it. we gotta get this off the screen.:::['8-12-165']
carol's still upset that you taught him "pull my finger.":::['8-12-166']
pull my finger. my hand is messed up!:::['8-12-167']
i am not gonna answer that. oh, come on. just pick one.:::['8-12-168']
between monica, phoebe, chandler and ross......if you had to... if you had to,who would you punch?:::['8-12-169']
no one. they're my friends. i wouldn't punch any of them.:::['8-12-170']
yeah, but i don't know why.:::['8-12-172']
i'm having a wonderful time! me too.:::['8-12-173']
hey, rach, can i just say......i think this is the best date i ever had.:::['8-12-174']
i've never laughed so hard. did you see the wine come out my nose?:::['8-12-176']
yes. joey, i think everybody saw the wine come out of your nose.:::['8-12-177']
i gotta say, i never knew i could enjoy the non-sex part of a date so much.:::['8-12-178']
that's because you have never been on a date with me before.:::['8-12-179']
all right. now don't judge me.:::['8-12-181']
i normally wait till my date leaves, but you live here.:::['8-12-182']
i'm ripping into the swan.:::['8-12-183']
okay, well then, you don't judge me.:::['8-12-184']
i'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie i had before.:::['8-12-185']
mm. mm.:::['8-12-186', '10-9-299']
so tell me, what are joey tribbiani's end-of-the-night moves?:::['8-12-187']
uh, well, if i want the girl to kiss me......first thing i do is make my lips:::['8-12-188']
look irresistible.:::['8-12-189']
how do you do it?:::['8-12-190']
now you can't tell anyone, but, uh......i put on shiny lip balm.:::['8-12-191']
oh, my god. like a moth to a flame, i'm telling you.:::['8-12-192']
okay, all right, so now you go. no, i don't want to tell you.:::['8-12-193']
why not? it's embarrassing.:::['8-12-194']
more embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?:::['8-12-195']
i didn't say raspberry before, did i?:::['8-12-196']
just tell me, rach. just tell me. ha, ha.:::['8-12-197']
okay. all right, stand up.:::['8-12-198']
well, when we're at the door......i lightly press my lips against his.:::['8-12-199']
then move into his body, just for a second.:::['8-12-200']
and then i make this sound::::['8-12-201']
mmm.:::['8-12-202']
i know it doesn't sound like anything, but it works.:::['8-12-203']
oh, yeah. that would work, yeah.:::['8-12-204']
all right, i gotta go to bed. i had such a wonderful time.:::['8-12-205']
mwah. oh, yeah.:::['8-12-206']
you were 50 minutes late to the class? did you crawl there?:::['8-12-208']
no, i ran, okay? it's really far.:::['8-12-209']
when did people stop understanding "get the hell out of my way"?:::['8-12-210']
why didn't you take a cab?:::['8-12-211']
ugh. between the traffic and one-way streets, it'd take me twice as long.:::['8-12-212']
besides, i teach the class three times a week. who am i, rockefeller?:::['8-12-213']
you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.:::['8-12-214']
i have to. if i don't, they'll take the class away from me.:::['8-12-215']
and i already put it in my family newsletter.:::['8-12-216']
your what? you've seen it, the geller yeller.:::['8-12-217']
right. wow.:::['8-12-218']
besides, i figured out a faster route. i'm sure i can make it this time.:::['8-12-219']
i just can't be afraid to get a little bit hit by cars.:::['8-12-220']
hey. hi!:::['8-12-221']
hey, remember, um, last night when we were talking about cujo?:::['8-12-222']
oh, yeah, i can't believe you haven't seen cujo. what is wrong with you?:::['8-12-223']
relax, it's not like it's citizen kane.:::['8-12-224']
have you ever tried to sit through citizen kane?:::['8-12-225']
yeah, i know. it's really boring.:::['8-12-226']
but it's a big deal. yeah.:::['8-12-227']
anyway, i was thinking about renting cujo sometime.:::['8-12-228']
well, yeah, all right. let's do it tonight.:::['8-12-229']
don't you have that big date tonight? oh, right.:::['8-12-230']
hey, joey, can i ask you something? yeah.:::['8-12-231']
after our date last night, did you feel a little weird?:::['8-12-232']
oh, my god. you did too? it freaked me out. what was that?:::['8-12-233']
i'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.:::['8-12-235']
oh, yeah. yeah, the lobster.:::['8-12-236']
i was up sick all night. yeah, me too. all night.:::['8-12-237']
really? how come we didn't cross paths?:::['8-12-238']
yeah, well, that's because, uh......i stayed in my room.:::['8-12-239']
yeah, you don't want to look in my hamper.:::['8-12-240']
okay, i got that.:::['8-12-241']
i'll escape there. i'll come back here.:::['8-12-242']
all right. come on, ms. pac-man...:::['8-12-243']
well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?:::['8-12-244']
hey, you guys?:::['8-12-245', '7-7-301']
i'm sorry that i was hogging the game before.:::['8-12-246']
oh, my god, your friends have some unfortunate initials.:::['8-12-247']
they're all chandler. chandler sucks.:::['8-12-248']
he couldn't have gotten this good. i did.:::['8-12-249']
but it came at a price. ugh.:::['8-12-250']
ben's coming, and he can't see this.:::['8-12-251']
come on, by age 7, kids have already seen orgies.:::['8-12-252']
was it just me?:::['8-12-253']
yes, i made it! i'm on time!:::['8-12-254']
agh.:::['8-12-255', '7-5-314', '5-12-217']
okay, why don't we all, uh......open our books to page 23......where......where you will see a, uh......a bunch of, uh, red spots.:::['8-12-256']
okay, why don't, uh, you all start to read, while i...:::['8-12-257']
hey, are you all right? you seem a little distracted.:::['8-12-258']
no, no, i'm fine. it's just...:::['8-12-259']
have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while......and suddenly seen them:::['8-12-261']
in a different way?:::['8-12-262']
you mean like from behind?:::['8-12-263']
yeah. yeah. that's exactly it.:::['8-12-264']
one time i saw this guy from behind, and he seemed totally normal.:::['8-12-266']
and then he turned around and it was stephen baldwin!:::['8-12-267']
ooh, yeah. so you know exactly what i'm talking about.:::['8-12-268']
totally! wow. ha-ha-ha.:::['8-12-269']

throwing himself at the windshield?:::['8-12-283']
no. no! seriously, what's wrong with the dog?:::['8-12-284']

oh. sure, yeah. why not?:::['8-12-291']

oh, my god. what's he gonna do now? i can't watch.:::['8-12-295']
ugh, seriously, how can you watch this? aren't you scared?:::['8-12-296']
terrified.:::['8-12-297']
so is everybody here? i got here a little early, myself.:::['8-12-298']
let us begin.:::['8-12-299']
now, the hadrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations.:::['8-12-300']
here......and here.:::['8-12-301']
now, as for the hadrosaurus...:::['8-12-302']
joey: all right, it's a new day. that stuff about rachel?:::['8-13-0']
you don't feel that now. it was crazy. you're fine. you're better than fine.:::['8-13-1']
you are, as your friend tony would say, "great!":::['8-13-2']
everything's normal. she's just your friend, rachel.:::['8-13-3']
your friend, rachel. your friend. rachel.:::['8-13-4']
hi, sweetie. joey: hey, it's your girlfriend, rachel!:::['8-13-5']
are you...? are you high?:::['8-13-7']
i had the most amazing bath.:::['8-13-8']
really? i don't like baths. you like them with me.:::['8-13-9']
honey, it's not the bath i enjoy. it's the wet, naked lady.:::['8-13-10']
baths are so relaxing. really? what do you do?:::['8-13-11']
you just sit in there, stewing in your own filth.:::['8-13-12']
how dirty do you think i am?:::['8-13-13']
if you had some candles and bubbles and music, you'd love it.:::['8-13-14']
it'd take all your stress away.:::['8-13-15']
it's 2:00 on wednesday, i'm watching road rules. how stressed am i?:::['8-13-16']
hey, chandler. i really need to talk to you.:::['8-13-17']
oh, uh, yeah. is this a cold pizza or a leftover-meat loaf talk?:::['8-13-18']
well, neither. oh, my god, what's up?:::['8-13-19']
i don't know. it's just... lately, i've been feeling...:::['8-13-20']
okay, here's what it is. heh.:::['8-13-21']
i feel a lot better. thanks. wait a minute. just come back.:::['8-13-22']
okay. you and monica, friends for a long time.:::['8-13-23']
and sure, there are rules. but then you went to london.:::['8-13-24']
but that's different. there are rules there too, know what i mean?:::['8-13-25']
do you?:::['8-13-26', '2-6-283', '5-6-208', '3-18-43', '3-20-170']
it was different for you guys. you were both in the same place.:::['8-13-27']
in london. yeah.:::['8-13-28']
yes, when monica and i were in london, we were both in london.:::['8-13-29']
this is a bad idea. forget all about it.:::['8-13-30']
this conversation, between you and me.:::['8-13-31']
if that.:::['8-13-32']
hi. oh, ross, don't forget that doctor's appointment.:::['8-13-33']
right. to find out the sex of the baby?:::['8-13-34']
we don't wanna know as long as it's happy and healthy.:::['8-13-35']
yep, healthy. and cute. and smart.:::['8-13-36']
popular. with an aptitude for science.:::['8-13-37']
are you two talking about the same baby?:::['8-13-38']
have you thought of names? oh, yeah. i've come up with a bunch.:::['8-13-39']
really? me too. me too.:::['8-13-40']
really? uh-huh.:::['8-13-41', '8-20-299', '5-21-182']
if it's a girl, phoebe. and if it's a boy, pheebo.:::['8-13-42']
maybe. but it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know?:::['8-13-43']
rach, what were you thinking? okay.:::['8-13-44']
um, i was thinking if it's a girl......how about sandrene? it's french.:::['8-13-45']
that's a really pretty name for an industrial solvent.:::['8-13-47']
fine. what do you have? it's for a boy.:::['8-13-49']
i know it's a little out there, but......darwin.:::['8-13-50']
our child will be beaten in the schoolyard.:::['8-13-51']
yeah, by sandrene.:::['8-13-52']
you're saying that because i said no to you.:::['8-13-53']
i'm really, really not.:::['8-13-54']
how about you each get five vetoes?:::['8-13-55']
all right. that sounds fair. i don't think you'll need it.:::['8-13-56']
if it's a girl, rain.:::['8-13-57']
veto. why?:::['8-13-58']
rain? "hi, my name is rain.:::['8-13-59']
i have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.":::['8-13-60']
i know her!:::['8-13-61']
i bought a homemade soap from her at a dead show!:::['8-13-62']
okay. how about for a guy, thatcher? why do you hate our child?:::['8-13-63']
fine, you go. okay. james.:::['8-13-64']
but only if it's a girl. oh, veto.:::['8-13-66']
i like ruth. what about ruth?:::['8-13-67']
oh, i'm sorry. are we having an 89-year-old?:::['8-13-68']
how about dayton? veto. stewart.:::['8-13-69']
veto. sawyer.:::['8-13-70']
veto. helen. veto.:::['8-13-71']
is it me, or is veto starting to sound really good?:::['8-13-72']
boy, do i have a surprise for you.:::['8-13-74']
sex on the balcony?:::['8-13-75']
no. but someone's not gonna get over that idea.:::['8-13-76']
what? i drew you a bath.:::['8-13-77']
i don't like baths. could you draw me a picture of sex on the balcony?:::['8-13-78']
try it for me. i used all my best stuff.:::['8-13-79']
i lit candles, i put on music. i used bath salts, plus bubble bath.:::['8-13-80']
and got you this little plastic navy ship! so it's a boy bath.:::['8-13-81']
this does butch it up a bit. i swear, you will love it.:::['8-13-82']
if i do this, can we discuss balcony sex?:::['8-13-83']
but i know how that discussion's gonna go.:::['8-13-85']
who can say where the road goes?:::['8-13-86']
chandler: all right, this isn't bad. i like the flowery smell.:::['8-13-87']
which is okay, because i've got my boat.:::['8-13-88']
so? oh, my god.:::['8-13-89']
i told you you were a bath person. hey, maybe i can give you a facial.:::['8-13-90']
i'm gonna need a bigger boat.:::['8-13-91']
i don't think you had an open mind about ruth.:::['8-13-92']
little ruthie geller? how cute is that?:::['8-13-93']
oh, my god, i can practically hear the mahjong tiles.:::['8-13-94']
all your tests look fine. are you interested in the sex of the baby?:::['8-13-95']
no, we're not. you have it right there?:::['8-13-96']
you know if it's a boy or a girl? dayton or sandrene? phoebe or pheebo?:::['8-13-97']
but if you don't wanna know...:::['8-13-98']
no, we wanna wait. right? right. right.:::['8-13-99']
oh, i'll be right back.:::['8-13-100']
i know it's really not my place......but please don't name:::['8-13-101']
your child pheebo.:::['8-13-102']
so, which of these babies is the ugliest?:::['8-13-103']
what? rach, come on, that's terrible.:::['8-13-104']
they're babies. they're all beautiful.:::['8-13-105']
third one from the left? yeah. why is it staring at me?:::['8-13-106']
i think it knows i'm talking about it. don't you...? you're looking!:::['8-13-107']
i didn't! i saw you!:::['8-13-108']
fine, i did, but i didn't see anything.:::['8-13-109']
shame on you! ugly baby judges you!:::['8-13-110']
but i didn't... don't tell me! i don't wanna know!:::['8-13-111']
i couldn't, because i don't know!:::['8-13-112']
i swear i didn't see anything! it was just a momentary lapse.:::['8-13-113']
"momentary lapse." don't you have any self-control?:::['8-13-114']
okay. a couple months late on the lecture, ross.:::['8-13-115']
chandler: can you come in here? there's something wrong.:::['8-13-117']
you know what? i think i'll wait out here.:::['8-13-118']
chandler: i'm in the bathtub. oh.:::['8-13-119']
what's wrong? i drew a bath, but i did it wrong.:::['8-13-120']
the water's tepid, the salt didn't dissolve and is now lodged places.:::['8-13-121']
and the scents i used don't compliment each other. eucalyptus and chamomile? oh!:::['8-13-122']
what? bath salts.:::['8-13-123']
they're starting to effervesce.:::['8-13-124']
it's different. it's interesting.:::['8-13-125']
let's talk about something else.:::['8-13-126']
yeah. sure. so, what was going on with you today?:::['8-13-127']
i actually had the weirdest conversation with joey.:::['8-13-128']
he was talking about rules and right and wrong.:::['8-13-129']
i had the same conversation. what was he talking about?:::['8-13-130']
he hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since he was in macbeth.:::['8-13-131']
that was a long night. what exactly did he say to you?:::['8-13-132']
he was talking about rules and looking at people differently.:::['8-13-133']
not to me. what'd he tell you?:::['8-13-134']
he asked about you, me and london.:::['8-13-135']
and the glue that holds this all together, the rules.:::['8-13-136']
okay. so you, me and london.:::['8-13-137']
looking at people differently.:::['8-13-138']
maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london.:::['8-13-139']
but what'd he mean by "rules"?:::['8-13-140']
wait. he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in.:::['8-13-141']
he's looking at her differently. phoebe is his friend.:::['8-13-142']
that'd be breaking the rules.:::['8-13-143']
my god, he wants to do it with phoebe in london!:::['8-13-144']
phoebe: you guys? um, just a minute!:::['8-13-145']
that's mrs. tribbiani. you don't say anything.:::['8-13-146']
why would i? that two of our friends could start a great love affair?:::['8-13-147']
they'd have me to thank. then we could all start having babies!:::['8-13-148']
i won't let you say anything. stay here.:::['8-13-149']
oh. i brought back your iron.:::['8-13-151']
you had that? i thought i lost it. i got a new one a month ago.:::['8-13-152']
oh, just as well. i broke this one.:::['8-13-153']
i really shouldn't say. i'm really not supposed to.:::['8-13-156']
it's a humdinger. too bad you can't tell me.:::['8-13-158']
somebody likes you!:::['8-13-159']
ugh. is it chandler? no!:::['8-13-160']
then tell him to stop staring. it's joey.:::['8-13-161']
really? joey? you don't say.:::['8-13-162']
would you be interested? i don't know, i don't know.:::['8-13-163']
you know, i mean, on the one hand, "mother, may i?":::['8-13-164']
but, you know, on the other hand...:::['8-13-165']
no. no, i can't. we're friends.:::['8-13-166']
oh, no. i don't wanna risk what we have.:::['8-13-167']
i guess that makes sense. you think you're gonna talk to him?:::['8-13-168']
sure. i mean, it's joey. i don't want him to get hurt.:::['8-13-169']
well, i must say, i am on fire! first chandler, now joey.:::['8-13-170']
not chandler. just joey. sure.:::['8-13-171']
you know what? i'm coming around on the name ruth.:::['8-13-173']
i'd consider naming our child that.:::['8-13-174']
rach, i can't tell you how much that means to me. oh...:::['8-13-175']
you hated the name ruth. why would you change your mind?:::['8-13-177']
unless you know we're never gonna have to use it.:::['8-13-178']
you did see. you know it's a boy!:::['8-13-179']
i didn't see anything. i changed my mind.:::['8-13-180']
i don't think so. you're giving me ruth......so you get to name him:::['8-13-181']
when it's a boy.:::['8-13-182']
that's when you'll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia.:::['8-13-183']
i would... sequoia!:::['8-13-184']
veto. fine.:::['8-13-185']
unless you anticipated that i would figure all this out......and you know that it actually is a girl.:::['8-13-186']
and you really do want her to be named ruth.:::['8-13-187']
well, i'm not falling for that! okay? ruth is off the table!:::['8-13-188']
but, ross, you want the name ruth. not like this!:::['8-13-189']
hey. hey. what's up?:::['8-13-190']
um, joey, i know. what?:::['8-13-191']
i know. what?:::['8-13-192']
i know about your feelings. oh, my god, you do?:::['8-13-193']
i'm sorry. things worked out for chandler and monica, but that's rare.:::['8-13-194']
i know. and this is so much more complicated than it was for them.:::['8-13-195']
i mean, it's rachel, for god's sakes.:::['8-13-196']
for god's sakes, it's rachel!:::['8-13-197']
i know! she's not only my friend, she's my pregnant friend.:::['8-13-198']
she's my pregnant friend who's ross' ex!:::['8-13-199']
yeah, that's rachel. beat me over the head with it.:::['8-13-200']
what am i gonna do? i keep trying to get rid of these feelings.:::['8-13-201']
i made a list of everything i don't like about her.:::['8-13-202']
you wanna hear it? yeah.:::['8-13-203']
"she made me switch to light mayo." that's it! that's all i got!:::['8-13-204']
you know what? tastes the same and my pants fit better.:::['8-13-205']
joey, you're getting upset for nothing.:::['8-13-206']
this is probably just a crush. you think?:::['8-13-207']
absolutely. you get this rush of feelings, but it goes away.:::['8-13-208']
yeah, just a crush. that's all this is. it's a crush!:::['8-13-209']
i'm joey. i don't get deep feelings.:::['8-13-210']
there you go. crushes happen all the time.:::['8-13-211']
i've had them for all you guys. except for ross and chandler.:::['8-13-212']
and i'm sure you've had them for us. not really.:::['8-13-213']
throw me a bone here.:::['8-13-214']
so i, uh... i called the doctor.:::['8-13-215']
now we both know the sex of the baby. what?:::['8-13-216']
that's right. the student has become the master.:::['8-13-217']
ross, i swear. i don't know. oh, come on, you know it's a girl.:::['8-13-218']
a what? you really didn't know?:::['8-13-219']
we're having a girl? no.:::['8-13-220']
that's what you said. no.:::['8-13-221']
you said girl. yes. i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.:::['8-13-222']
i'm not! we're having a girl!:::['8-13-223']
sometimes i can't believe it's with you, but still, we're having a girl!:::['8-13-224']
i know! you know what? i'm putting ruth back on the table.:::['8-13-225']
yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby ruth.:::['8-13-226']
permission to veto. yes, please.:::['8-13-227']
hey. do i smell essential oils?:::['8-13-228']
i'm gonna take a bath. i was gonna get a magazine.:::['8-13-229']
what do you think you're doing?:::['8-13-231']
leaving my troubles behind?:::['8-13-232']
you're new at this, but this is unacceptable bath decorum.:::['8-13-233']
it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.:::['8-13-234']
you can have the bath, but i am taking your boat.:::['8-13-235']
now you're just a girl in a tub.:::['8-13-236']
hey! hi, bubbles. manly.:::['8-13-237']
i thought i'd let you know how it went.:::['8-13-238']
you told her? she pulled it out of me!:::['8-13-239']
she's like a conversational wizard! how did it go?:::['8-13-240']
you were wrong. he doesn't like me. what?:::['8-13-241']
how would you like it if i told you that lee majors liked you......and you found out that he didn't like you?:::['8-13-242']
how would you feel?:::['8-13-243']
i don't think i'd care. really? lee majors is hot.:::['8-13-244']
joey: hello? we're in the bathroom!:::['8-13-245']
joey: why? because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!:::['8-13-246']
what are you guys doing in here? oh, my god.:::['8-13-247']
a friend he's looking at differently, but it's wrong.:::['8-13-248']
it's rachel! you like rachel?:::['8-13-249']
it's no big deal. phoebe and i talked. it's a crush. it'll go away.:::['8-13-250']
dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.:::['8-13-251']
hey. oh, hi. ross and i were looking for you.:::['8-13-253']
what are we all doing in here? oh, my.:::['8-13-254']
honey, cover it up with the boat.:::['8-13-255']
ross: hello?:::['8-13-256']
we're all in here, and we'd love for you to join us!:::['8-13-257']
well, hey! what's going on? oh, cool boat. oh, no.:::['8-13-258']
did you tell them? i waited for you.:::['8-13-259']
tell us what? we're having a girl.:::['8-13-260']
oh, wow! really? oh, my god!:::['8-13-261']
i'll get you later.:::['8-13-262']
joey: all right. it's a new day. and it's just a crush.:::['8-13-263']
that's all. just a little crush.:::['8-13-264']
all that worrying i was doing? that was crazy. crazy.:::['8-13-265']
like my friend the bird here would say, "it was cuckoo!":::['8-13-266']
everything's gonna be fine. it's just a crush.:::['8-13-267']
hi, sweetie. joey: i love you.:::['8-13-268']
it's nice to do this together, isn't it?:::['8-13-269']
yeah. and what you're doing feels so good.:::['8-13-270']
i'm not touching you. you're not?:::['8-13-271']
it's the salts. sweet lord, new realms of pleasure.:::['8-13-272']
whatever keeps you off the balcony, big guy.:::['8-13-273']
phoebe. yeah?:::['8-11-0', '5-21-265']
look at that guy by the window. wow!:::['8-11-1']
he's awfully short. and i think he's talking to himself.:::['8-11-2']
and to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.:::['8-11-3']
ugh, what is wrong with me lately? it's, like, every guy i see.:::['8-11-4']
look at that guy, for example.:::['8-11-5']
normally that's not someone that i would be attracted to.:::['8-11-6']
but right now, with the way i'm feeling......all i wanna do is rip off:::['8-11-7']
his sweatpants and fanny pack.:::['8-11-8']
wait a second! this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy, right?:::['8-11-9']
yeah. this is completely normal.:::['8-11-10']
around the fourth month, your hormones go crazy.:::['8-11-11']
really? so this happened to you? absolutely, yeah.:::['8-11-12']
and keep in mind, i was carrying triplets.:::['8-11-13']
so in medical terms, i was thrice as randy.:::['8-11-14']
wow, this explains so much.:::['8-11-15']
last weekend, i went from store to store, sitting on santas' laps.:::['8-11-16']
yeah, i remember trying to steal......a cardboard cutout of evander holyfield:::['8-11-17']
from a footlocker.:::['8-11-18']
ugh. yeah, ugh.:::['8-11-19']
i go see my doctor tomorrow. i'll ask her about this.:::['8-11-20']
maybe she can give me a pill or something.:::['8-11-21']
yeah, that's what you need. a good pill.:::['8-11-22']
look, i got our pictures developed.:::['8-11-25']
oh, great. joey, wanna check out pictures of me and mona ice-skating?:::['8-11-26']
oh, uh, ordinarily i would love to, but i am just swamped right now.:::['8-11-27']
where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?:::['8-11-28']
oh, yeah. probably at the end.:::['8-11-29']
oh, my god. all he took were pictures of my breasts!:::['8-11-30']
i'm missing picture time?:::['8-11-31']
you know, she has a face, ross.:::['8-11-32']
okay, here's a good one of us. wow, that is a good one.:::['8-11-33']
wow, it looks like a holiday card......with the tree in the middle:::['8-11-34']
and the skaters and the snow. heh.:::['8-11-35']
every year i say i'll send cards and i never do it.:::['8-11-36']
do you wanna send this one out together?:::['8-11-37']
together? like, to people?:::['8-11-38']
yeah, "happy holidays, from mona and ross." lt'll be cute. okay?:::['8-11-39']
heh. uh, okay.:::['8-11-40']
oh, i gotta get to work. call me later? sure.:::['8-11-41']
bye, guys. phoebe: bye.:::['8-11-42']
bye. yeah.:::['8-11-43']
congratulations! you just got married!:::['8-11-44']
i know. can you believe that?:::['8-11-45']
i'm sorry. what's the big deal about a holiday card?:::['8-11-46']
married couples send out cards. families send out cards.:::['8-11-47']
people who've been dating a few months do not send out cards. is she crazy?:::['8-11-48']
hey, hey, hey. that's your wife you're talking about.:::['8-11-49']
bing! ho, and the bingette! ah, heh.:::['8-11-50']
honey, you remember my boss, doug. yes. hi.:::['8-11-51']
so, good news, the divorce is final. i signed the papers this a.m.:::['8-11-52']
i didn't know you were getting a divorce. i'm sorry.:::['8-11-53']
heh, sorry? finally chewed my leg out of that bear trap.:::['8-11-54']
hey! congratulations to you guys. heh. no leg-chewing for us.:::['8-11-55']
well, give it time.:::['8-11-56']
so! the divorce, the marriage, we got a lot to celebrate.:::['8-11-57']
how about we go out to dinner tomorrow night?:::['8-11-58']
i can't think of anything we're doing.:::['8-11-59']
why can't i think of anything we're doing?:::['8-11-60']
tomorrow night it is. i should be out of court by 6.:::['8-11-61']
they keep throwing sexual harassment cases at me......and i keep knocking them:::['8-11-62']
out of the park! ha-ha-ha.:::['8-11-63']
okay, see you tomorrow.:::['8-11-64']
just so you know, we're not seeing him tomorrow.:::['8-11-65']
i cannot spend another evening with that man.:::['8-11-66']
remember how he behaved at our wedding?:::['8-11-67']
no. because he wasn't invited.:::['8-11-68']
because of the way he behaved at our engagement party.:::['8-11-69']
oh, yeah. boy, urine cuts right through an ice sculpture, doesn't it?:::['8-11-70']
hi! hey.:::['8-11-71']
hey, i went by the photo shop. take a look.:::['8-11-72']
here is a mockup of our card. what do you think?:::['8-11-73']
huh. wow, this is great.:::['8-11-74']
now, do you think it should say, "love, ross and mona"?:::['8-11-75']
well, we haven't said that to each other yet......but i guess it's okay:::['8-11-76']
to say it to other people.:::['8-11-77']
how many did you want? i'm getting 100. a hundred? ha-ha-ha.:::['8-11-78']
well, i, uh, guess i'll take, uh...:::['8-11-79']
mona?:::['8-11-80', '8-15-168', '8-17-142']
uh, i don't... i'm not sure about the whole, uh, card thing.:::['8-11-81']
really? why not?:::['8-11-82']
sending out a holiday card together?:::['8-11-83']
i just don't know if we're really quite there yet.:::['8-11-84']
i didn't think of it that way. you're right. you're right.:::['8-11-85']
so can i ask you a question? yeah.:::['8-11-86']
where are we? huh?:::['8-11-87']
you know, where are we? where is this relationship going?:::['8-11-88']
i mean, i love spending time with you. i hope we're moving forward.:::['8-11-90']
we should talk about that, don't you think?:::['8-11-91']
let's do the card!:::['8-11-92']
what? the card! i think we're there.:::['8-11-93']
okay, but i still think we should have this conversation.:::['8-11-94']
really? i mean, even with the card?:::['8-11-95']
just so you know, dr. long can't be here today. she was called to the hospital.:::['8-11-97']
so dr. schiff will be seeing you.:::['8-11-98']
okay. can i ask you a question?:::['8-11-99']
was it me, or was the guy who took my blood sample really cute? heh.:::['8-11-100']
you know who i'm talking about? bowl haircut, hairy fingers?:::['8-11-101']
hi, rachel. i'm dr. schiff. yes, you are.:::['8-11-102']
so how's it going?:::['8-11-103']
oh, it's really good. but enough about me! come on. heh.:::['8-11-104']
where are you from? what do you do?:::['8-11-105']
i'm a doctor. right. i meant......you know, in your spare time.:::['8-11-106']
do you cook? ski?:::['8-11-107']
or hang out with your wife or girlfriend?:::['8-11-108']
uh, i don't have a wife or girlfriend, but i do ski.:::['8-11-109']
i love to ski! how amazing is this?:::['8-11-110']
are you experiencing any discomfort? no, i'm very comfortable.:::['8-11-111']
any painful gas? no!:::['8-11-112']
ew, dr. schiff! what kind of question is that?:::['8-11-113']
okay, then. would you like to lie down on the table?:::['8-11-114']
would you like me to lie down on the table?:::['8-11-115']
sorry, is there something going on here? do you feel it too?:::['8-11-116']
hi. oh, hey. so......how did your doctor's appointment go?:::['8-11-117']
uh, they gave me "cute boy" doctor today.:::['8-11-119']
in the middle of the exam i put my pinkie in his chin dimple.:::['8-11-120']
oh, my god! why did you do that?:::['8-11-121']
okay, remember that problem i was having during my fourth month of pregnancy?:::['8-11-122']
oh, yeah, the evander holyfield phase.:::['8-11-123']
oh, man. you were so hard up, you practically came on to me.:::['8-11-124']
you wish!:::['8-11-125']
hey, i could've had you if i wanted you.:::['8-11-126']
oh, yeah? come and get it.:::['8-11-127']
okay, even this is turning me on.:::['8-11-128']
hey. oh, hey.:::['8-11-129']
hey, ross. how's it going with you and mona?:::['8-11-130']
you guys still together?:::['8-11-131']
oh, yeah, we're moving forward. you'll be getting our card.:::['8-11-132']
you and mona are doing a holiday card together?:::['8-11-133']
we're not just doing a card.:::['8-11-134']
she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going.:::['8-11-135']
ugh, women.:::['8-11-136']
i know! why do you guys need to have this conversation, huh?:::['8-11-137']
no self-respecting man would ask a woman, "so where is this going?":::['8-11-138']
uh, ross, you asked me that.:::['8-11-139']
hey, you were a closed book, okay? i'm not a mind reader!:::['8-11-140']
besides, i hate those conversations. i'm horrible at them, really.:::['8-11-141']
maybe i need some kind of a gesture.:::['8-11-142']
something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.:::['8-11-143']
like asking her to move in with you? wha...? ha. smaller than that.:::['8-11-144']
making her a mix tape? uh, bigger than that.:::['8-11-145']
give her a key to your apartment. whoa, hello. we were closer with the tape.:::['8-11-146']
have you said "i love you"? say, "i love you.":::['8-11-147']
i don't... i don't think i'm quite there yet.:::['8-11-148']
but, oh, i could say, "i love spending time with you.":::['8-11-149']
no, we hate that. that is a slap in the face.:::['8-11-150']
oh, forget it. you know what? i'll just have the conversation.:::['8-11-151']
i'll just say, "i like things the way they are," and hope for the best.:::['8-11-152']
what do you think, rach?:::['8-11-153']
i think if it was a little colder in here......i could see your nipples:::['8-11-154']
through that sweater.:::['8-11-155']
bing, we're all set for tonight. 8:00.:::['8-11-156']
oh, uh, as it turns out, we can't do it. monica has to work.:::['8-11-157']
oh. my ex-wife didn't work.:::['8-11-158']
unless you call turning into her mother "work.":::['8-11-159']
now, fine. tomorrow night, then.:::['8-11-160']
oh, uh, well, tomorrow's no good for her, either.:::['8-11-161']
oh? why not?:::['8-11-162']
it's the semifinals......of her......bocce ball tournament.:::['8-11-163']
ahem. what's going on, bing?:::['8-11-164']
does, uh, your wife have a problem with me, or something?:::['8-11-165']
well now you're just talking crazy.:::['8-11-166']
then why can't the three of us go out together?:::['8-11-167']
because, uh, we split up.:::['8-11-168']
monica and i split up.:::['8-11-169']
hold me.:::['8-11-170']
good god, bing.:::['8-11-171']
well, i can't say i'm altogether surprised.:::['8-11-172']
i saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.:::['8-11-173']
and the way she looked at me, pure lust.:::['8-11-174']
what would help me through this tough time......is choking someone.:::['8-11-175']
can i choke you?:::['8-11-176']
bing, my boy, we're gonna get you over this.:::['8-11-177']
here's the plan: grab your coat, we're going to a strip club!:::['8-11-178']
oh, no, monica would freak.:::['8-11-179']
but to hell with that bitch!:::['8-11-180']
ah, mona, um......i think it's time we had a conversation:::['8-11-182']
about where things are with us.:::['8-11-183']
yeah, i think i suggested that.:::['8-11-184']
heh. uh, we are so...:::['8-11-185']
so, um......well, i really like you.:::['8-11-186']
and i love, um, you know, hanging out with you.:::['8-11-187']
and i'm having a lot of fun.:::['8-11-188']
i mean, there's no point in spending time with someone if it's just fun.:::['8-11-190']
it's gotta be going somewhere, right? ha, ha.:::['8-11-191']
so where is it going?:::['8-11-192']
that's the real question.:::['8-11-194']
and the answer is......it's going somewhere......fun.:::['8-11-195']
i know what you're thinking. fun was fine for you 10 years ago.:::['8-11-196']
ha-ha-ha. but you're not getting any younger.:::['8-11-197']
no, i mean, not you. not you. you are getting younger!:::['8-11-198']
you look like you're getting younger by the second. what's your secret?:::['8-11-199']
i'm sorry, so, uh, where are we?:::['8-11-200']
well, to sum up::::['8-11-201']
we're having fun. you look young.:::['8-11-202']
okay... but that's not enough.:::['8-11-203']
so, heh, so......here's a key to my apartment.:::['8-11-204']
really? really.:::['8-11-205', '4-21-223']
you don't think this is too fast? mm-mm.:::['8-11-206']
you gave her a key to your apartment?:::['8-11-207']
not just a key, i gave her the only key!:::['8-11-208']
i am now a homeless person in a very serious relationship.:::['8-11-209']
oh, ross, how'd the conversation go? great. i live on the street.:::['8-11-210']
hey! rachel: hi.:::['8-11-212']
okay, monica, rachel, this is my friend roger.:::['8-11-213']
hi, roger. rachel: hi, roger.:::['8-11-214']
hi. so, um, i'm gonna get us some drinks.:::['8-11-215']
okay. could you help me?:::['8-11-216']
um, he's here to have sex with you.:::['8-11-218']
what? you're welcome.:::['8-11-219']
phoebe, no!:::['8-11-220']
it's okay. he's a virgin.:::['8-11-221']
rachel, um, i was talking to this guy......and i think he'll have sex with you.:::['8-11-222']
yeah, okay. let's leave these two alone. aah!:::['8-11-224']
no. i don't care what my hormones are doing.:::['8-11-225']
i'm not gonna just do it with some random guy.:::['8-11-226']
fine. then you tell roger. he was really looking forward to this.:::['8-11-227']
over speakers]:::['8-11-228', '7-13-185', '10-11-229', '3-15-254']
ooh, bing, look at those twin sisters dancing together.:::['8-11-229']
let me buy you a lap dance with those girls, huh?:::['8-11-230']
that's all right, sir. and that's just one girl.:::['8-11-231']
bing, what's this?:::['8-11-232']
it's a hand. it's a thing you use as a jack and coke holder.:::['8-11-233']
no, it's a wedding ring. you gotta get rid of it.:::['8-11-234']
we're gonna go to the east river and throw it in!:::['8-11-235']
oh, no, no, no! yeah, yeah!:::['8-11-236']
i did, and i felt a hell of a lot better!:::['8-11-237']
if you whip it right, you might hit a seagull in the head.:::['8-11-238']
okay. oh, i'm gonna need a bunch of extra keys.:::['8-11-239']
apparently, i give them away for no reason at all.:::['8-11-240']
hey, ross, what's going on? you changing the lock?:::['8-11-241']
no, heh.:::['8-11-242']
that guy is.:::['8-11-243']
i don't understand.:::['8-11-244', '10-5-138', '3-6-243']
you give me a key to your apartment and then change the lock?:::['8-11-245']
uh... good luck, buddy.:::['8-11-246']
um, i thought we were moving forward.:::['8-11-247']
and now you're sending me all these mixed signals.:::['8-11-248']
what are you trying to tell me?:::['8-11-249']
i'm trying to tell you......i made you a mix tape.:::['8-11-250']
what? i love you.:::['8-11-251', '5-22-152']
oh! aww!:::['8-11-252']
heh, oh.:::['8-11-253']
and i love spending time with you.:::['8-11-254']
hi, honey, i'm home. from the tequila factory?:::['8-11-255']
it was awful.:::['8-11-256']
to get out of dinner with doug, i told him you and i split up.:::['8-11-257']
so he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars.:::['8-11-258']
and when i wouldn't give him my wedding ring, he threw a soda can at a bird.:::['8-11-259']
come here. i can breathe through my mouth.:::['8-11-260']
know what the worst part was?:::['8-11-261']
i got to see what my life would be like without you.:::['8-11-262']
it was like it's a wonderful life with lap dances.:::['8-11-263']
please promise me that you'll never leave me......that we'll grow old together,and be with each other the rest of our lives.:::['8-11-264']
i promise.:::['8-11-265', '9-3-330', '3-8-34']
hey, speaking of together, how about we send out a holiday card this year?:::['8-11-266']
ooh, i don't know if we're there yet.:::['8-11-267']
yes, i'd like to order a pizza. can i ask you a question?:::['8-11-268']
is the cute blond guy delivering tonight? very "abercrombie & fitch.":::['8-11-269']
i'll call you back. who was that?:::['8-11-270']
just the pizza place. you hung up on the pizza place?:::['8-11-271']
i don't hang up on your friends.:::['8-11-272']
sorry, i'm just having a rough day. oh. what's wrong?:::['8-11-273']
oh, you really don't wanna hear about it. then why did i ask?:::['8-11-274']
okay. it's just that this is really embarrassing.:::['8-11-275']
but lately with this pregnancy thing......i'm just finding myself...:::['8-11-276']
how do i put this? um...:::['8-11-277']
erotically charged.:::['8-11-278']
is that college talk for "horny"?:::['8-11-279']
yeah. so, you know, i have all of these feelings......and i don't know:::['8-11-280']
what to do about them.:::['8-11-281']
because i can't date like a normal person.:::['8-11-282']
which is fine, i don't need a relationship.:::['8-11-283']
all i really want is one great night. just sex.:::['8-11-284']
you know? no strings attached. no relationship.:::['8-11-285']
just with someone i feel comfortable with and who knows what he's doing.:::['8-11-286']
for just one great night. i mean, is that really so hard......to find?:::['8-11-287']
so how was your day?:::['8-11-288', '3-18-239']
good. i, uh, saw a pretty big pigeon.:::['8-11-289']
i gotta get up early, and it's almost 7:00.:::['8-11-290']
yeah, i gotta go to my room too.:::['8-11-291']
rachel: okay, good night. good night!:::['8-11-292']
i can't do it! i didn't ask you to!:::['8-11-293']
you're rachel! you're joey!:::['8-11-294']
you're my friend! yeah. right back at you.:::['8-11-295']
plus, it would be wrong, and weird and bad!:::['8-11-296']
so bad! i don't know what you're talking about. i didn't ask you to do anything.:::['8-11-297']
you wanna do it? no!:::['8-11-299']
me neither, i'm just testing you! that's the end of this conversation!:::['8-11-300']
this conversation never happened. never happened.:::['8-11-301']
good night. good night!:::['8-11-302']
get back in there!:::['8-11-303']
hi. listen, ahem, i'm sorry about that whole thing with roger.:::['8-11-304']
it really wasn't right, and i wanna make it up to you.:::['8-11-305']
so, um, i brought you something......that i think you'll really enjoy. okay.:::['8-11-306']
now this is just a loan, okay? i'm gonna want him back. so...:::['8-11-307']
i'm gonna go now.:::['8-11-308']
i'm sorry, i thought i could do it, and i can't.:::['8-11-309']
hey. hey. so, what do you think?:::['8-10-0']
new haircut? necklace? dress? boots? boots!:::['8-10-1']
yes! they're a little more than i usually spend on boots. um, or rent.:::['8-10-2']
i know. i'll miss being able to afford food.:::['8-10-4']
i'm sorry. they just looked so good. the saleswoman was like::::['8-10-5']
"these are too expensive for you." she had a point.:::['8-10-6']
hey. hi. oh, my god.:::['8-10-7']
oh, monica, those boots are amazing! they're mine!:::['8-10-8']
too bad we'll have to return them. return them? shh! they're gonna hear you.:::['8-10-9']
i'm not returning them. i know they cost a lot, but i'll wear them all the time. you'll see!:::['8-10-10']
besides, i love the compliments.:::['8-10-11']
have you ever had something everyone wants?:::['8-10-12']
i have you. nice try. i'm keeping the boots.:::['8-10-13']
that's right. i love you.:::['8-10-14']
and i'm gonna play with you all the time.:::['8-10-15']
how can you let him talk to your crotch like that?:::['8-10-16']
he's talking to the baby. oh! okay.:::['8-10-17']
okay. when he said, "i can't wait to hear your first words"......i thought, "there's a trick.":::['8-10-18']
okay, well i gotta go, you guys. i'll see you later.:::['8-10-19']
okay. all right.:::['8-10-20', '10-2-289', '4-20-163', '3-2-116', '3-1-47']
oh, hey, rach. um... hi. can you do me a favor? my sister knows you work at ralph lauren...:::['8-10-22']
forget it! no way. i'm not sending more clothes to prison.:::['8-10-23']
it is a waste. no! not her.:::['8-10-24']
my youngest sister, dina. she's interested in fashion.:::['8-10-25']
she wants to talk to someone successful to give her some advice.:::['8-10-26']
i'll talk to my supervisor. no, no. she wants to talk to you.:::['8-10-27']
really? oh, my god. i'm successful.:::['8-10-28']
would you meet with her? i'd love to. have her come by.:::['8-10-29']
great. you'll love her. she's the smartest of all the tribbiani children.:::['8-10-30']
yeah, you know the sats? yeah.:::['8-10-31']
she took them.:::['8-10-32']
hey, ross, doesn't ben go to smithfield school? yeah. why?:::['8-10-33']
sting has a son that goes there. i know. he's in ben's class.:::['8-10-34']
you knew and never said anything? with all the stupid dinosaur stuff you tell us?:::['8-10-35']
fine, no more dinosaur stuff. can i talk about fossils?:::['8-10-36']
"sting's son, 7." there's a picture.:::['8-10-37']
what are you reading? "a kidnapper's guide to manhattan private schools?":::['8-10-38']
it's new york magazine, an article about the best schools in the city.:::['8-10-39']
so how well do you know sting? i haven't met him.:::['8-10-40']
uh-huh. that's too bad. i wanna go to his concert friday, but it's sold out.:::['8-10-41']
i know! why don't you meet him and get tickets?:::['8-10-42']
if you get two, i'll take you.:::['8-10-43']
i'm picking ben up tomorrow. maybe he'll be there.:::['8-10-44']
there you go. ugh, you're so lucky. you might meet sting tomorrow.:::['8-10-45']
that's why you have kids.:::['8-10-46']
hi, monica. hi, boots.:::['8-10-48']
see? i'm getting a lot of use out of them already.:::['8-10-49']
they're very practical. you can wear them with dresses, skirts, pants...:::['8-10-50']
wear them with shorts on the corner and earn money to pay for them.:::['8-10-51']
wow, they're beautiful. they hurt so much.:::['8-10-52']
what? the guy who made these......hates feet:::['8-10-53']
and wants to see them die.:::['8-10-54']
give them to me. i haven't felt my feet in years.:::['8-10-55']
i can't. i spent so much on them, and told chandler i'd wear them all the time.:::['8-10-56']
i can't just give them away. then get your money back, return them. i can't do that either.:::['8-10-57']
the soles are scuffed up, and the insides are filled with my blood.:::['8-10-58']
hey. hey. hey, i, uh, just picked up ben from school. oh.:::['8-10-59']
i don't think you did a very thorough job.:::['8-10-60']
i dropped him off at carol's.:::['8-10-61']
anyway, i'm not gonna get those tickets.:::['8-10-62']
oh, no. why not?:::['8-10-63']
well, it turns out ben and sting's son do not get along.:::['8-10-64']
how come? apparently, sting's son made fun......of the fact that ben's moms:::['8-10-65']
are "les-be-nims.":::['8-10-66']
wait! if they don't get along, you should smooth things over.:::['8-10-67']
make them be friends. you can't force kids to be friends.:::['8-10-68']
sure you can. give them some blocks. put them in a playpen.:::['8-10-69']
playpen? ben's 7. your kid is 7?:::['8-10-70']
he's really small.:::['8-10-71']
please! please get the tickets. i'm sorry. i just can't do it.:::['8-10-72']
yes, you can. sting says so himself. what?:::['8-10-73']
ross can!:::['8-10-74', '8-10-76', '8-10-276']
look, pheeb, i'm sorry...:::['8-10-75']
ross can get me the tickets!:::['8-10-78']
here she is. future fashion superstar.:::['8-10-79']
oh, joey, i'm hardly... my little sister, dina!:::['8-10-80']
right. hi, dina. nice to meet you. hi.:::['8-10-81']
thanks for meeting me. joey's told me so much about you.:::['8-10-82']
joey: this is exciting for her.:::['8-10-83']
well, i'll let you two fash... ...ists get down to business.:::['8-10-84']
okay. all right, dina.:::['8-10-85']
let's talk about the different areas of fashion......you could get involved in.:::['8-10-86']
let's see. there's design. but you may need another degree for that.:::['8-10-87']
uh, there's sales, which is great. you get to travel.:::['8-10-88']
i don't care about fashion! i'm pregnant. and i know you are too, so you gotta help me.:::['8-10-89']
and there's marketing.:::['8-10-90']
ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!:::['8-10-91']
oh, oh, oh, oh!:::['8-10-92']
what's wrong? oh, nothing. i'm just... i just was yawning.:::['8-10-93']
don't forget my office holiday party tonight.:::['8-10-94']
we don't really have to go tonight, do we?:::['8-10-95']
sweetie, i know that you don't like my office parties. but you can wear your new boots. ha, ha.:::['8-10-96']
see? every cloud has a supple leather lining.:::['8-10-97']
i don't wanna wear the boots tonight. why not?:::['8-10-98']
i'm worried your bosses might see them and think they pay you too much money.:::['8-10-99']
or your assistant will see them and want a raise.:::['8-10-100']
do you think i work at a boot-pricing company?:::['8-10-101']
anyway, i picked an outfit, and the boots don't go with it.:::['8-10-102']
you said you paid all that money... ...because those boots go with skirts, dresses and pants.:::['8-10-103']
fine, if you want me to wear the boots, i'll wear the boots.:::['8-10-104']
in fact, i'll go in to my room now and try the outfit on.:::['8-10-105']
ooh-wee! ha, ha.:::['8-10-107']
christmas party in my boots! ha, ha, ow, ha, ha, ow.:::['8-10-108']
i can't go in there. i can't tell him.:::['8-10-109']
it'll be okay. he's been incredibly supportive of me.:::['8-10-110']
and if he gets a little upset, that's what the meatball sub is for.:::['8-10-111']
thank you. rachel: okay.:::['8-10-112']
hey! it's my fashion girls!:::['8-10-113']
what's wrong? why don't you sit down?:::['8-10-114']
dina has something that she wants to tell you.:::['8-10-115']
oh. what's going on? is it mom?:::['8-10-116']
is she sick? is it dad's heart? is that a sandwich?:::['8-10-117']
joe, mom and dad are fine. is that a sandwich?:::['8-10-118']
joey, there's something that you should know. dina?:::['8-10-119']
i'm pregnant. what?:::['8-10-120']
now. give him the sandwich. give him the sandwich!:::['8-10-121']
obviously, this is a mistake. you can't be pregnant.:::['8-10-122']
you have to have sex to get pregnant.:::['8-10-123']
joe, i tried to wait until i was 25, like you did.:::['8-10-124']
what? dina... bub!:::['8-10-125']
sh...:::['8-10-126']
i can't believe this! you're the good one. you went to college. both years!:::['8-10-127']
who did this to you? bobby corso. but he's a real nice guy.:::['8-10-128']
i like him a lot. he's real funny.:::['8-10-129']
you got pregnant for "funny"? dina, if he's funny, laugh!:::['8-10-130']
i'll be back in a while. stay here! why?:::['8-10-131']
i can't look at you right now.:::['8-10-132']
wow. i know.:::['8-10-133', '9-13-223']
oh, there you are, ben.:::['8-10-134']
aunt phoebe, what are you doing here?:::['8-10-135']
i heard you have a problem with a boy in your class.:::['8-10-136']
and so i thought i'd just come down here... ...i'd sit you both down, have a talk and make it all okay.:::['8-10-137']
now, um, the boy's name is sting's son.:::['8-10-138']
jack? i hate him. he's a jerk.:::['8-10-139']
now, ben, sometimes people may seem like jerks on the outside......but they have famous fathers.:::['8-10-140']
i have to go. my friend doug is waiting for me.:::['8-10-141']
him you're friends with.:::['8-10-142']
excuse me, can i help you with something? yes. yes you can. i'm looking for jack's parents.:::['8-10-143']
are you with a student? uh-huh. i'm with ben.:::['8-10-144']
are you one of ben's mothers? i am one of ben's mothers.:::['8-10-145']
i'm a lesbian.:::['8-10-146']
it was difficult coming out to my parents.:::['8-10-147']
heh, well, hi. i'm jenny boon. i'm the new teacher here.:::['8-10-148']
oh. i've only met your partner, carol. ah! okay, that would make me susan. heh.:::['8-10-149']
right. are you looking for jack's parents to discuss......the problems he's having with ben?:::['8-10-150']
yeah. i think the parents should sit down together and converse.:::['8-10-151']
yeah, let's do that!:::['8-10-152', '10-4-250']
that sounds good. we should sit and talk.:::['8-10-153']
just me, my lover, carol, and the stings.:::['8-10-154']
how will i get in touch with them? their number's on the contact sheet.:::['8-10-155']
uh-huh. um, could i get a copy of that? carol threw it out. she lost ours.:::['8-10-156']
she's such a scatterbrain. but, man, what a hot piece of ass.:::['8-10-157']
that wasn't bad. i didn't know there'd be dancing.:::['8-10-158']
that was a fun surprise!:::['8-10-159']
i don't see any, uh, cabs. we should walk. no, we can't walk.:::['8-10-160']
it's, like, 15 blocks to the subway. let's go.:::['8-10-161']
do you think we can get to the subway if we climb through that manhole cover?:::['8-10-162']
what's going on? i can't walk, okay? okay?:::['8-10-163']
these boots were a huge mistake. what?:::['8-10-164']
you were right. i never should've bought them. they're killing me, one toe at a time.:::['8-10-165']
i was right. this is what it feels like to be right.:::['8-10-166']
it's oddly unsettling.:::['8-10-167']
how are will gonna get home? maybe a piggyback ride?:::['8-10-168']
hop on. okay, wait. give me a second.:::['8-10-169']
let me just get my boots off first.:::['8-10-170']
honey, i know you're in pain right now, but i'm a little turned on.:::['8-10-173']
do you worry that you'll be walking and your baby will slip out?:::['8-10-174']
what college was that, dina?:::['8-10-175']
oh, my god! bobby?:::['8-10-176']
hi, dina. good to see you.:::['8-10-177']
joey, what are you doing? just what needs to be done.:::['8-10-178']
dearly beloved, we're gathered here... ugh, joey, this is crazy.:::['8-10-179']
don't interrupt me when i'm talking to god!:::['8-10-180']
where were we? do you take this man...? no!:::['8-10-181']
oh, you'll take him. no i won't!:::['8-10-182']
hey, you don't get a say. yes i do.:::['8-10-183']
ah, i heard "i do." we're halfway there. okay, you. all right, joey, that is enough!:::['8-10-184']
listen, as beautiful and moving as this ceremony is, this is not legal.:::['8-10-185']
they don't have a marriage license, they don't have witnesses... ...and the groom only has on one shoe.:::['8-10-186']
yeah, he took the other one off and hit me with it.:::['8-10-187']
what am i supposed to do?:::['8-10-188']
you're supposed to realize they are adults and can make their own decisions.:::['8-10-189']
no, they can't. they're stupid enough to get knocked up!:::['8-10-190']
contraceptives are not always effective. right?:::['8-10-192']
yeah. we kind of didn't use any. oh, come on, kids, a little help here.:::['8-10-193']
wow! this place is incredible!:::['8-10-194']
sting's pen. that he gave to phoebe.:::['8-10-195']
come on, secret passageway.:::['8-10-196']
i'm trudie. you must be ben's mum. uh-huh.:::['8-10-198']
why else would i be here? why don't you sit down? uh-huh.:::['8-10-199']
i gather jack and ben haven't been getting along.:::['8-10-200']
yeah. i'm sure there are two sides to this.:::['8-10-201']
but all i've heard is that ben's a bit of a "poo-poo head.":::['8-10-202']
um, i'm sorry. won't jack's father be joining us?:::['8-10-203']
i'm sorry, jack's father's not available.:::['8-10-204']
mm-hm. okay.:::['8-10-205']
well then could we reschedule for friday night, perhaps at 8:00?:::['8-10-206']
oh, no, that wouldn't work. my husband's in concert.:::['8-10-207']
concert. yeah. mm. that just put us in quite a pickle.:::['8-10-208']
because i'm very busy before and after the concert... ...and he's obviously busy during.:::['8-10-209']
so you and i should talk about jack and ben now.:::['8-10-210']
unless... unless, um...:::['8-10-211']
okay, i would be willing to go to the concert......um, all the while:::['8-10-212']
thinking about the children of course.:::['8-10-213']
are you here for tickets? ugh, thanks. four would be great.:::['8-10-214']
i'm not giving tickets to someone who'd use their son like this.:::['8-10-215']
oh, then you're in luck. ben's not my son.:::['8-10-216']
i've pressed a button triggering an alarm.:::['8-10-217']
any minute now, the police will be here. the police? here?:::['8-10-218']
a reunion? ooh!:::['8-10-219']
okay, 10 blocks down, five to go.:::['8-10-220']
oh, wait! stop! oh, i'm sorry. do you need a break?:::['8-10-221']
my boots in tan! get closer so i can see the price.:::['8-10-222']
i can see it from right here. it'll cost you one husband.:::['8-10-223']
okay, i think i can walk the rest of the way now. just give me my boots.:::['8-10-224']
i don't have your boots. i don't either. where are they?:::['8-10-225']
why don't you check in one of my saddlebags... ...while i chew on a bale of hay?:::['8-10-226']
okay. my god, we gotta go back and get them!:::['8-10-227']
are you seriously ever gonna wear the boots again?:::['8-10-228']
okay, i'll never wear them again. i didn't get a chance to say goodbye.:::['8-10-229']
know what? you can say goodbye to the tan ones.:::['8-10-230']
okay. all right. unh. okay.:::['8-10-231']
bye, boots. wait! half off!:::['8-10-232']
joey, because they're not getting married... ...doesn't mean this is a disaster.:::['8-10-233']
maybe they have a plan. oh. oh! okay, let's hear their plan.:::['8-10-234']
what's the future look like for dina and bobby?:::['8-10-235']
well, i really have high hopes for my band.:::['8-10-236']
you were right. he is funny.:::['8-10-237']
wait! i bet when you told people you wanted to act, they laughed at you.:::['8-10-238']
bobby, tell us a little about your band.:::['8-10-239']
it's just me and my pal, rooster. the band's name is numbnuts.:::['8-10-240']
dina, if you're having a baby, you should be married.:::['8-10-242']
even if it is to bobby. dude, that's not a compliment.:::['8-10-243']
i knew you wouldn't be supportive. what are you gonna do?:::['8-10-244']
you're gonna have the baby and raise it by yourself, without a husband?:::['8-10-245']
you can't be a single mother alone! you're gonna ruin your life!:::['8-10-246']
excuse me. am i ruining my life? no, no, it's different for you.:::['8-10-247']
you're strong and together. you're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.:::['8-10-248']
excuse me? one pregnant woman at a time, please!:::['8-10-249']
i just want you to be okay.:::['8-10-250']
forcing her to marry bobby is gonna make that happen?:::['8-10-251']
yeah. so, uh, what kind of music does numbnuts...?:::['8-10-253']
ah, forget it! i can't!:::['8-10-254']
joey, i am scared to death about this. but i think i can do it. i just need some help.:::['8-10-255']
and bobby's gonna be here the whole time. you bet i am.:::['8-10-256']
to answer your earlier question, we're straight-up gangster rap.:::['8-10-257']
rachel's told me how much easier you've made this on her.:::['8-10-258']
why can't you do that for me? because! because you're my baby sister!:::['8-10-259']
and you're my big brother. i mean, you're my favorite guy in the whole world.:::['8-10-260']
i'm not even scared to tell mom and dad. i was scared of telling you.:::['8-10-261']
i'd be scared of them, but all right.:::['8-10-262']
i can't stand the thought of having this baby with you mad at me.:::['8-10-263']
i want him to have his uncle.:::['8-10-264']
is my baby gonna have his uncle joey?:::['8-10-265']
of course he's gonna have his uncle joey.:::['8-10-266']
we'll be all right. even if we're not married, this baby is gonna be so loved.:::['8-10-267']
and not just by us. that's right.:::['8-10-268']
by his uncle too. and by you.:::['8-10-269']
okay, bobby, come over here and let them have a little moment, okay?:::['8-10-270']
come here!:::['8-10-271']
no, seriously, what's wrong with you?:::['8-10-272']
you're gonna love me so much. i got sting tickets!:::['8-10-273']
oh, my god, i do love you! how did you do it?:::['8-10-274']
well, let's just say::::['8-10-275']
ohh!:::['8-10-277']
where are the seats? middle balcony.:::['8-10-278']
would you say that that's more than 50 yards away......from sting, his wife,or a member of his family?:::['8-10-279']
yeah. then that's not breaking the law! i'm there!:::['8-10-280']
hey. what's up? i left my guitar here again.:::['8-14-0']
oh, okay. no problem.:::['8-14-1']
okay. here you go. okay.:::['8-14-2']
what? you want to hang out or something?:::['8-14-4']
phoebe, you caught me at a bad time.:::['8-14-5']
oh, are you and chandler...? yes. exactly.:::['8-14-6']
okay. want me to play for you? no.:::['8-14-7']
hey, pheebs, what's up?:::['8-14-8']
you ask an intriguing question, chandler bing.:::['8-14-9']
oh, my god! you're getting a massage? you never let me massage you.:::['8-14-10']
phoebe, i can explain. you told me you hate massages.:::['8-14-11']
buy stamps. pick up dry cleaning. don't let phoebe in.:::['8-14-12']
i can't believe this. how long has this been going on?:::['8-14-13']
well, uh, alexandra has... oh, it has a name?:::['8-14-14']
phoebe, don't get upset.:::['8-14-15']
okay. oh, too late! i'm leaving. come on, chandler, let's go.:::['8-14-16']
well, i thought i'd...:::['8-14-17']
yeah, what the hell.:::['8-14-18']
okay, come on. one more push. unh! come on, we're almost there.:::['8-14-19']
joey, i'm so happy things worked out for us and we're having this baby together.:::['8-14-20']
i love you so much. oh, i love you too.:::['8-14-21']
mm. i hope it's not an inappropriate time to say this......but you're the best sex i've ever had.:::['8-14-22']
that's always appropriate. ha, ha.:::['8-14-23']
okay, come on, one more push. one more push.:::['8-14-24']
doctor: there we go.:::['8-14-25']
here is your beautiful baby. congratulations.:::['8-14-26']
i hope you're a better father than you are a friend!:::['8-14-27']
whoa! aah, whoa.:::['8-14-28']
joey! what, what?:::['8-14-29']
what's going on? uh... feel this. come feel my belly.:::['8-14-30']
the baby's kicking for the first time. please come feel.:::['8-14-31']
really? uh... yes.:::['8-14-32']
you know what? maybe, uh, you...:::['8-14-33']
maybe you should come to me.:::['8-14-34']
i'm not wearing any bottoms. oh, okay.:::['8-14-35']
oh, my god. aah!:::['8-14-36']
wow, she is kicking so much. she's like, um...:::['8-14-38']
who's that kind of annoying girl soccer player?:::['8-14-39']
mia hamm? mia hamm!:::['8-14-40']
oh! it's amazing. whoa. one hand on the sheet, joe.:::['8-14-41']
whoa, eh. sorry.:::['8-14-42']
hey, babe. monica: hey, honey.:::['8-14-43']
we got a wedding gift from bob and faye bing. they don't like us, do they?:::['8-14-44']
who says you can't get a nice punch bowl for under $6?:::['8-14-45']
maybe we can take it back. doesn't say where it's from.:::['8-14-46']
where would we return it? how about to the street, from the balcony?:::['8-14-47']
why don't we just find a place for it?:::['8-14-48']
how about in that cabinet?:::['8-14-49']
that's where we keep canned goods. have you forgotten everything you learned in orientation?:::['8-14-50']
how about the closet by the bathroom?:::['8-14-51']
oh. okay. why don't you let me do it. no, no, no. i will do it.:::['8-14-52']
you have to relax and let your husband take care of things once in a while.:::['8-14-53']
it's locked. you have to help me. why is it locked?:::['8-14-54']
no reason. i keep private things in there.:::['8-14-55']
you know, i've been living here a while... ...and i've never seen what's in that closet.:::['8-14-56']
what is in there?:::['8-14-57']
feminine stuff.:::['8-14-58']
don't try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff!:::['8-14-59']
nothing in there concerns you. if you love me, you'll just let it go.:::['8-14-60']
fine. thank you.:::['8-14-61', '7-12-170', '10-6-114', '3-7-45']
hello, chandler. lovely day, huh? you.:::['8-14-63']
if it helps, alexandra's only been massaging monica for, like, three years.:::['8-14-64']
if! i said, if it helps.:::['8-14-65']
why won't you let me massage you?:::['8-14-66']
uh, well, it's... i'd be self-conscious. you're my friend. i'd be naked.:::['8-14-67']
we lived together for years. i've seen you naked.:::['8-14-68']
that's different. we were roommates. and when?:::['8-14-69']
i'm curious about the human body.:::['8-14-70']
you can understand why this would be weird for me.:::['8-14-71']
i'm a professional and i'm really good.:::['8-14-72']
if you're uncomfortable, we can stop. just give me a chance, okay? please?:::['8-14-73']
okay, if it means that much to you.:::['8-14-74']
it does. how would you feel if you couldn't share your cooking?:::['8-14-75']
or imagine how ross would feel if he couldn't teach us about dragons.:::['8-14-76']
dinosaurs. potato, "potato.":::['8-14-77']
hey. ross, the baby's kicking.:::['8-14-78']
what? it is?:::['8-14-79']
it's not kicking right now.:::['8-14-80']
although we would love to see you do that again.:::['8-14-81']
when was it kicking? what happened?:::['8-14-82']
last night. i felt it. i went into joey's room, and he was sleeping.:::['8-14-83']
a dreamless sleep.:::['8-14-84']
my god, the baby's kicking. that's great.:::['8-14-85']
i wish i would have been there to feel the kicking for the first time.:::['8-14-86']
i got some stuff going on in here if you want to feel.:::['8-14-87']
i don't want to miss any more baby stuff. here's my pager number.:::['8-14-88']
anytime anything pregnancy-related happens, use it. i'll be there.:::['8-14-89']
i don't care if it's 3 in the morning and you want ice cream.:::['8-14-90']
wow. can i get a copy of that?:::['8-14-91']
phoebe: are you under the sheet? monica: yes.:::['8-14-92']
great, let's begin.:::['8-14-93']
how's the pressure? ah.:::['8-14-94']
it's nice. wow, phoebe, you are good.:::['8-14-95']
stating the obvious, but thank you.:::['8-14-96']
and it's not weird, is it? no.:::['8-14-97']
that's right, you just enjoy.:::['8-14-98']
oh, yeah!:::['8-14-99', '7-21-267']
oh, oh!:::['8-14-100', '8-14-281', '7-9-199', '4-17-95', '4-19-267']
oh, yeah! okay.:::['8-14-101']
oh, god, phoebe!:::['8-14-102']
oh, that's it! that's it, right there! oh!:::['8-14-103']
i wasn't trying to open your closet. i wasn't trying, i swear.:::['8-14-104']
wow. monica runs a pretty tight ship here, doesn't she? what are you doing?:::['8-14-105']
monica has a secret closet. she won't let me see what's in it.:::['8-14-106']
why not? i don't know! what could she possibly be hiding in here what i can't see?:::['8-14-107']
i don't know. ooh.:::['8-14-108']
i'll bet it's richard.:::['8-14-109']
why would monica be keeping richard in here?:::['8-14-110']
well, off the top of my head, uh......maybe she's having her cake:::['8-14-111']
and eating it too.:::['8-14-112']
you being the "cake," richard being the "too.":::['8-14-113']
or... and here we go.:::['8-14-114']
i saw this movie once where there was a door. nobody knew what was behind it.:::['8-14-115']
and when they finally got it open, millions and millions of bugs came pouring out......and they feasted on human flesh!:::['8-14-116']
you know, it wouldn't kill you to respect your wife's privacy!:::['8-14-117']
stupid closet full of bugs!:::['8-14-118']
joey, something feels weird and not good weird. i don't... whoa!:::['8-14-119']
whoa! don't worry. when my sisters were pregnant......they got every weird feeling:::['8-14-120']
and it was always nothing.:::['8-14-121']
really? joey: absolutely.:::['8-14-122']
but we'll stop by the hospital just to be sure. i'll page ross.:::['8-14-123']
okay, oh, god... ow.:::['8-14-124']
oh, okay, rach, look at me. everything's gonna be fine. okay. trust me. take my hand. here we go.:::['8-14-125']
ow! crushing bones!:::['8-14-126']
good thing we're going to a hospital.:::['8-14-127']
hey. so? she's fine.:::['8-14-128']
she was experiencing braxton hicks contractions. mild discomfort in the uterine wall. hmm.:::['8-14-129']
mild discomfort? i take it you've had one of these braxton thingies?:::['8-14-130']
everything is normal? doctor: yes.:::['8-14-131']
there's no danger to her or the baby? doctor: no.:::['8-14-132']
contractions can be unnerving if you don't know, but she's fine.:::['8-14-133']
thank you, doctor. and thank you for being nice and calm.:::['8-14-134']
calm? i wasn't calm! i've never been more scared in my life.:::['8-14-135']
you said everything was okay. what do i know? i'm not a doctor.:::['8-14-136']
but everything is okay. i'm fine. you sure?:::['8-14-137']
yes. i got half a mind to contract that doctor's uterus.:::['8-14-138']
mild discomfort! what's he talking about?:::['8-14-139']
is everything okay? everything's fine.:::['8-14-140']
your page said, "come to the hospital." what happened?:::['8-14-141']
something called braxton hicks contraction.:::['8-14-142']
ugh, oh. ha, ha.:::['8-14-143']
that's no big deal. most women don't feel them.:::['8-14-144']
okay, no uterus, no opinion.:::['8-14-145']
hey, uh, what's with the candy?:::['8-14-146']
when you beeped me i was at the concession stand at the movies.:::['8-14-147']
you went to the movies by yourself? no... mona!:::['8-14-148']
oh, i gotta go back in there. why? what's wrong?:::['8-14-149']
everything's fine, i just gotta... no, really, tell me. what's up?:::['8-14-150']
look, i forgot my underwear.:::['8-14-151']
so thanks so much for bringing her to the hospital.:::['8-14-152']
oh, hey, don't worry about it. no big deal.:::['8-14-153']
but still, it should have been me. i'm the dad.:::['8-14-154']
if you have questions... ...here's information on braxton hicks. thanks.:::['8-14-155']
and by the way, you did the right thing by bringing her in.:::['8-14-156']
you're gonna make a wonderful father. oh, uh...:::['8-14-157']
hey, not as good as this guy. he brought twizzlers.:::['8-14-158']
there has got to be a way. easy there, captain kirk.:::['8-14-159']
oh, do you have a bobby pin? yeah.:::['8-14-160']
oh, no, wait. i'm not a 9-year-old girl.:::['8-14-161']
then why do you throw like one?:::['8-14-162']
maybe monica has a bobby pin. oh, sure, "monica.":::['8-14-163']
so how's the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming?:::['8-14-164']
really good. i should be ready to kill myself any day now.:::['8-14-165']
well, you sure found that quick.:::['8-14-166']
i just wish i didn't feel this way about rachel. i wish things could go back to normal.:::['8-14-167']
i mean, i love living with her, and helping out with the baby is amazing.:::['8-14-168']
but now i think ross feels left out.:::['8-14-169']
you know? when i had to take rachel to the hospital... ...the doctor thought i was the father. god, you...:::['8-14-170']
you should have seen the look on ross' face.:::['8-14-171']
by the way, i have no idea what i'm doing here. for all i know, i'm locking it more.:::['8-14-172']
hey, you try opening it with a credit card? that's a good idea. okay. yeah.:::['8-14-173']
so, uh, ross is kind of bummed, huh? ugh.:::['8-14-174']
i ju... i feel terrible. it's not your fault.:::['8-14-175']
what are you gonna do, not take her to the hospital? you're doing nothing wrong.:::['8-14-176']
except for harboring an all-consuming love for the woman carrying his baby.:::['8-14-177']
richard, if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?:::['8-14-178']
i gotta tell you, yesterday was amazing. that massage felt so good.:::['8-14-180']
no, no, i got that.:::['8-14-181']
so, um, what do you say we make it a weekly appointment?:::['8-14-182']
you should know though, i've, um, raised my rates to $200 an hour.:::['8-14-184']
okay. i mean 500.:::['8-14-185']
oh, you make sex noises when you get massaged.:::['8-14-188']
wha...? and it really freaked me out. after a while, i even tried to hurt you and it just spurred you on.:::['8-14-189']
what? you're crazy. there's nothing sexual about the noises i make.:::['8-14-190']
really? there's nothing sexual about this?:::['8-14-191']
oh, god! oh, oh, oh!:::['8-14-192']
what are you looking at?:::['8-14-193', '8-22-0']
i mean, hi.:::['8-14-194']
this is so embarrassing. i'm never gonna get massaged again.:::['8-14-195']
no, you can't let this stop you from getting massages.:::['8-14-196']
look, i have lots of clients that make the same noises you do.:::['8-14-197']
really? well, not clients. lovers.:::['8-14-198']
let's just... we'll try it again. come back, and we'll work through it.:::['8-14-199']
you sure? yes.:::['8-14-200']
i guess. great! now, if you'll just excuse me.:::['8-14-201']
so did you hear something you liked?:::['8-14-202']
hey, ross, check it out! i learned a new trick. huh?:::['8-14-203']
hey, uh, i brought you some lunch. oh!:::['8-14-204']
that's so sweet of you. oh, yum. eh.:::['8-14-205']
did you put pickles on this? well, yeah.:::['8-14-207']
what? what? rach, what?:::['8-14-208']
what's going on? i made her favorite, tuna with pickle.:::['8-14-209']
pickle? pickle makes her sick.:::['8-14-210']
giving her pickle is like giving me salad.:::['8-14-211']
i'm sorry, i didn't know. you gonna be okay?:::['8-14-212']
rachel: i'll be fine. but someone make sure that sandwich is gone when i get out.:::['8-14-213']
i'm on it!:::['8-14-214']
i can't believe this. i shouldn't be the one making her throw up.:::['8-14-215']
dude, relax. it could happen to anyone. not to you. you know this stuff.:::['8-14-216']
i don't know any of it and i'm the father.:::['8-14-217']
i just... i wish i could be more involved, you know?:::['8-14-218']
well, if anyone is keeping score, i no longer eat tuna.:::['8-14-220']
hey, uh, can i talk to you guys for a second?:::['8-14-221']
yeah. what's up?:::['8-14-222']
well... sit down. i wanna talk about our situation.:::['8-14-223']
are you breaking up with us?:::['8-14-224']
the thing is......because i live with rachel,i'm here for a lot of the stuff.:::['8-14-225']
okay, and ross...:::['8-14-226']
ross is missing everything. so...:::['8-14-227']
maybe you two should live together.:::['8-14-229']
are you asking me to move out? do you not want me here?:::['8-14-230']
no, i love living with you. it just seems that......if you're gonna have a roommate,it may as well be the father.:::['8-14-231']
but, joey, i don't think ross wants me to move in to his apartment... ...and disrupt his life like that. i mean...:::['8-14-232']
or he does.:::['8-14-233']
i would love to be around for you and the baby.:::['8-14-234']
we can just try it, like on a temporary basis.:::['8-14-235']
but it's you and me. it wouldn't be anything romantic.:::['8-14-236']
and i'm dating mona. damn it, mona!:::['8-14-237']
i was supposed to meet her an hour ago. what is wrong with me?:::['8-14-238']
i don't know. is it crazy? no. no, it's not...:::['8-14-240']
joey, this is a smart idea.:::['8-14-241']
well, i was due.:::['8-14-242']
okay, let's do it. i'll move in. really?:::['8-14-243']
oh, rach, that's great. that's great. mm.:::['8-14-244']
not too shabby. i got this all off myself......using my wife's tools.:::['8-14-245']
how did you get in there?:::['8-14-247']
you're messy.:::['8-14-248']
no! you weren't supposed to see this! i married fred sanford.:::['8-14-249']
no, chandler, you don't understand.:::['8-14-250']
theme song]:::['8-14-251']
okay, okay, fine! now you know. okay? i'm sick.:::['8-14-252']
no, honey, you're not sick. i don't love you because you're organized.:::['8-14-253']
i love you in spite of that.:::['8-14-254']
promise you won't tell anyone? yes.:::['8-14-256']
now that i know, if i've got extra stuff lying around, can we share the closet?:::['8-14-257']
oh. well, it's just, um...:::['8-14-258']
i'm afraid you might mess it up.:::['8-14-259']
so rachel's all moved out, huh? how you taking it?:::['8-14-261']
well, uh, i wanted to have a few beers......but, uh, i got rid of those because:::['8-14-262']
rachel couldn't stand the smell of them.:::['8-14-263']
i have thrown back a lot of orange juice with calcium though.:::['8-14-264']
and, uh, it's a couple weeks past its expiration date, so it's got a bit of a kick.:::['8-14-265']
are you okay? you kidding me? yeah, i'm great.:::['8-14-266']
i'm, uh... i'm better than great. i am good.:::['8-14-267']
now that she's gone, i can, uh...:::['8-14-268']
i can do all the stuff around here that i couldn't do before. you know?:::['8-14-269']
like, um...:::['8-14-270']
i can walk around naked again.:::['8-14-271']
you know? i can, uh...:::['8-14-272']
i can watch porn in the living room. right?:::['8-14-273']
this is, uh... this is good for me.:::['8-14-274']
i like being on my own. i'm better off this way.:::['8-14-275']
i'm a... i'm a lone wolf.:::['8-14-276']
a loner. alone.:::['8-14-277']
all alone. forever.:::['8-14-278']
what's a wolf gotta do to get a hug around here?:::['8-14-279']
that's it, just relax. unh.:::['8-14-280']

oh! hey, rach! hi.:::['8-15-0']
rachel: happy valentine's day! you too!:::['8-15-1']
hey, so, uh, how's it going living over at ross'?:::['8-15-2']
it's good, except he makes us watch the discovery channel all day long.:::['8-15-3']
did you know that something really boring... ...happened to someone really ugly in the middle ages?:::['8-15-4']
thank you. see you guys later. okay.:::['8-15-5']
that is one lucky to-go cup of coffee.:::['8-15-7']

i wanna be with the woman i love on valentine's day!:::['8-15-14']
i want her to love me back.:::['8-15-15']

we have red bagels.:::['8-15-17']
so how does mona feel about you and rachel living together?:::['8-15-19']
i'm on my way to tell her right now.:::['8-15-20']
she's been away all week visiting parents, but she'll be cool.:::['8-15-21']
she's been so supportive.:::['8-15-22']
she even got the baby a tiny t-shirt that says, "fossils are my friends.":::['8-15-23']
ugh, come on, mona. don't kiss ass.:::['8-15-24']
so, uh, i'm gonna take off. all right.:::['8-15-25']
oh, shoot! oh, shoot! uh, rachel wanted to see this tape.:::['8-15-26']

could you bring it back to your apartment? all right.:::['8-15-28']
"candy and cookie"?:::['8-15-29', '8-15-56']

you don't want my opinion? not really.:::['8-15-37']
come on, i'm your older brother. ask me.:::['8-15-38']
oh, okay, big brother. um...:::['8-15-39']

the red one.:::['8-15-42']
hey. mm.:::['8-15-43']

no, i'm not sleeping with your friend jane again.:::['8-15-46']
phoebe: hee-hee! hey, a dog! oh, hi!:::['8-15-47']
who, you gotta admit, looks a lot like jane.:::['8-15-48']
this is the happiest dog in the world. i borrowed him from my friend wendy.:::['8-15-49']
so you can keep him until he cheers you up. and he will cheer you up.:::['8-15-50']
thanks so much, pheebs. we are gonna have so much fun! yes we are!:::['8-15-51']

i accidentally packed these with my stuff.:::['8-15-70']
who is this? that's, uh, phoebe's friend's dog.:::['8-15-71']
i don't know his real name. i call him mozzarella.:::['8-15-72']
ohh, you are so cute. i wish i could play with you more, but i've gotta go to work.:::['8-15-73']
i hope i stop talking like this before my marketing meeting. yes, i do.:::['8-15-74']
bye-bye, joey. seriously, i can't stop it.:::['8-15-75']
come here! hey!:::['8-15-76']
hey. that's rachel. she's the one who used to live here.:::['8-15-77']
might as well be honest with you. we love her.:::['8-15-78']
but we can't have her. no.:::['8-15-79']
i really miss her.:::['8-15-80']
hey, you understand, right? you're a guy.:::['8-15-81']
well, you used to be.:::['8-15-82']
i've still got it.:::['8-15-84']
why did you get me this? what is it?:::['8-15-85']
it's yelling, bleeding, dilating.:::['8-15-86']
oh, the dilating!:::['8-15-87']
is this the video of the baby being born? this is phoebe's. why were you even watching it?:::['8-15-88']
i thought maybe you got me porn for valentine's day.:::['8-15-89']
chandler, if you thought i was gonna get you porn for valentine's day......you were right.:::['8-15-90']
apparently, it's about a girl who moves to the city in search of stardom......but ends up having sex:::['8-15-91']
with a lot of guys.:::['8-15-92']
it got four stars.:::['8-15-93']
oh, wait a minute. those aren't stars.:::['8-15-94']
anyway, you wanna take a look? well...:::['8-15-95']
i'm not really in a sexy mood right now. hey, what's going on?:::['8-15-96']
well, remember the first time you saw jaws......how long it took:::['8-15-97']
to go back in the water?:::['8-15-98']
chandler, we can't let this tape wreck valentine's day.:::['8-15-99']
you don't know. you didn't see it. childbirth is a natural thing. it's beautiful.:::['8-15-100']
oh, beautiful? really? huh, really?:::['8-15-101']
you think this is beautiful?:::['8-15-102']
oh, my god! no wonder my mother hates me!:::['8-15-103']
see, honey, there's... don't touch me!:::['8-15-104']
hi! hey!:::['8-15-105']
so how was atlantic city? good.:::['8-15-107']
i brought you back a present. what...?:::['8-15-108']
come on, you didn't have to...:::['8-15-109']
saltwater taffy? ha-ha-ha.:::['8-15-110']
thanks. mm.:::['8-15-111']
it's interesting, most people think this is made with seawater.:::['8-15-112']
but it's actually made with, uh, salted fresh water.:::['8-15-113']
that's not interesting.:::['8-15-114']
i think it's interesting. i do too. i missed you!:::['8-15-115']
me too. how was your week? oh, it was good.:::['8-15-116']
actually, the baby started kicking. how exciting.:::['8-15-117']
yeah, aw. it was amazing. the only sad thing is, i wasn't around when it happened the first time.:::['8-15-118']
oh, no. i was missing out on all this stuff.:::['8-15-119']
joey suggested rachel move in with me. ha, ha. yeah, right.:::['8-15-120']
what? joey cracks me up.:::['8-15-121']
"yeah, have your ex-wife move in. that wouldn't be awkward at all." heh.:::['8-15-122']
huh. heh.:::['8-15-123']
hey, imagine, i go away for a few days......i come back and my boyfriend is living:::['8-15-124']
with some woman he got pregnant.:::['8-15-125']
so, what'd you tell him?:::['8-15-126']
how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you?:::['8-15-127']
i don't know. she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea.:::['8-15-128']
plus, she, uh... she got me taffy.:::['8-15-129']
taffy, really? i've never had any. ever?:::['8-15-130']
my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats.:::['8-15-131']
so are you just never gonna tell her?:::['8-15-133']
no, no, i will. i just want to butter her up first.:::['8-15-134']
i'm gonna take her to an amazing valentine's dinner... ...do all this romantic stuff.:::['8-15-135']
and then, when she thinks i'm the best boyfriend in the world......then i tell her my pregnant:::['8-15-136']
ex-girlfriend is living with me.:::['8-15-137']
if i haven't said it before, she's a lucky, lucky lady.:::['8-15-138']
so where are...? what the mother of crap is up with this stuff?:::['8-15-139']
god, is it gum? is it food? what's the deal?:::['8-15-140']
oh, it's nice. may i try a pink one?:::['8-15-141']
so between her and me being friends, and her history with ross......it just isn't gonna happen.:::['8-15-142']
it'd be like you falling in love with a cat.:::['8-15-143']
hey, buddy. how's my favorite dog, huh? how's my favorite dog?:::['8-15-145']
you're subdued.:::['8-15-146']
did you give him a beer? no.:::['8-15-147']
will you excuse us? we need to talk. sure.:::['8-15-148']
oh, me, right.:::['8-15-149']
he's miserable. what happened to him? nothing.:::['8-15-150']
we just talked about stuff. what stuff?:::['8-15-151']
rachel stuff.:::['8-15-152']
oh, joey, you bummed him out! this is the happiest dog in the world.:::['8-15-153']
he spends a day with you, and look at him.:::['8-15-154']
he's breathing.:::['8-15-155']
i'll take him back to wendy's. no, no, no. he's fine.:::['8-15-156']
hey, look. look.:::['8-15-157']
here's your ball! get the ball!:::['8-15-158']
get your ball! get your ball! get your ball!:::['8-15-159']

i broke the dog, pheebs! i broke the dog!:::['8-15-161']
i'm, uh, going to pick up mona. what you got going on tonight?:::['8-15-162']
oh, i've got big valentine's plans.:::['8-15-163']
i've got chinese food on the way, and the rest of your saltwater taffy.:::['8-15-164']
it's interesting. most people think that's made with seawater, when in fact...:::['8-15-165']
ross, we actually watched the documentary together.:::['8-15-166']
oh, my chinese food. i'll get my cash.:::['8-15-167']
what are...? hi! hi.:::['8-15-169']
what are you doing here? i'm supposed to pick you up.:::['8-15-170']
change of plans, i made you a valentine's dinner. surprise!:::['8-15-171']
oh! hey, mona! hi... hi, rachel.:::['8-15-172']
i'll be watching tv if anybody needs me.:::['8-15-175']
seriously, what is she doing?:::['8-15-176']
uh, you know, lately she just likes hanging out here.:::['8-15-177']
why? i think she's lonely.:::['8-15-178']
but it's valentine's day. i know.:::['8-15-179']
can't we ask her to go?:::['8-15-180']
well, no, she's way too emotional.:::['8-15-181']
and by emotional, i mean crazy!:::['8-15-182']
i'm not here! that's just my chinese food.:::['8-15-183']
oh, my god, she has food delivered here?:::['8-15-184']
mm-hm, yes, she's emotional, but ballsy.:::['8-15-185']
you know what? i'm gonna get in my sweats and eat this in bed.:::['8-15-186']
and you thought she was gonna be in our way!:::['8-15-187']
okay, why don't you, uh, open the champagne, and i will be right back.:::['8-15-188']
i've got a surprise for you. you got another ex-wife back there?:::['8-15-189']
ho, oh! heh. please start drinking.:::['8-15-190']
i'm just gonna grab the phone. oh, rachel, wait. hey, um...:::['8-15-191']
i hope you don't take this the wrong way, but, um...:::['8-15-192']
what are you doing? sorry, do you need the phone?:::['8-15-193']
listen, ross is too nice to say anything, but this is his apartment.:::['8-15-195']
and we gotta have some boundaries. so why don't you go to your place and give us some privacy?:::['8-15-196']
but, mona, i live here.:::['8-15-197']
happy valentine's day!:::['8-15-198']
or, something to remember me by.:::['8-15-199']
how long has it been this time? ninety seconds.:::['8-15-200']
that's better. ninety seconds is a long time not to think about it.:::['8-15-201']
except all i did was think about it.:::['8-15-202']
i know. it haunts me.:::['8-15-203']
up until now, the worst thing i ever saw... ...was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy.:::['8-15-204']
after this, i would gladly make that my screen saver.:::['8-15-205']
we have to get past this. why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed.:::['8-15-206']
i could do that. okay.:::['8-15-207']
okay, now all we gotta do is get rid of this chair.:::['8-15-208']
oh, thank god! oi.:::['8-15-210']
come in!:::['8-15-211']
hi. i'm sorry to barge in on your valentine.:::['8-15-212']
i had to get away from the yelling. mona is dumping ross.:::['8-15-213']
oh, my god. poor ross.:::['8-15-214']
oh, great. we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear... ...but for this he closes the drapes.:::['8-15-215']
rach, you know that birthing tape you wanted to see?:::['8-15-216']
rachel: mm-hm. it's here.:::['8-15-217']
oh, and we should warn you before you watch it. don't watch it.:::['8-15-218']
why, you saw it? is it scary?:::['8-15-219']
let's just say it's ironic how footage of someone being born......can make you want to kill yourself.:::['8-15-220']
now, wait, now i'm all freaked out. you guys will watch it with me?:::['8-15-221']
no, but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you.:::['8-15-222']
come on, seriously, you're not gonna make me watch this alone.:::['8-15-223']
she's right. of course not.:::['8-15-224']
honey, get the tape.:::['8-15-225']
this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape.:::['8-15-226']
man: all right, baby. one more time.:::['8-15-230']
why is that baby torturing that woman?:::['8-15-231']
why have i seen this thing three times?:::['8-15-232']
it's still beautiful.:::['8-15-233']
aah! it's horrible! i know, i know!:::['8-15-234']
i'm so sorry for you! oh, my god!:::['8-15-235']
you guys! you guys, look! what? did her ass explode?:::['8-15-236']
no, the baby's out. look. look.:::['8-15-237']
look at those little fingers and toes.:::['8-15-238']
and look how happy the mom is now.:::['8-15-239']
oh, rach. screw you! you don't have to do it!:::['8-15-240']
hey. hey! what...:::['8-15-241']
what's up? uh, mona just dumped me.:::['8-15-242']
oh, man, i'm sorry. why?:::['8-15-243']
with everything going on lately, i haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend.:::['8-15-244']
i didn't tell her i got rachel pregnant.:::['8-15-245']
i gave her a key to my apartment and then had the locks changed.:::['8-15-246']
then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me.:::['8-15-247']
in a way, i judge her for not breaking up with me sooner.:::['8-15-248']
that really sucks. especially on valentine's day.:::['8-15-249']
yeah. wait a minute. what are you doing here?:::['8-15-250']
joey tribbiani without a date on valentine's day?:::['8-15-251']
what's going on, huh? girl trouble? heh.:::['8-15-252']
sort of. ha, ha. really?:::['8-15-253']
you don't have to seem so happy about it.:::['8-15-254']
sorry. well, uh, maybe i can help. oh, i...:::['8-15-255']
whatever it is, i am sure it has happened to me.:::['8-15-256']
you know, actually, once i got dumped during sex.:::['8-15-257']
so anyway, uh, what is it? forget about it. it's no big deal.:::['8-15-258']
come on, what is it? it's nothing.:::['8-15-259']
hey, it's me. why can't you tell me?:::['8-15-260']
okay. uh, sit down. um...:::['8-15-261']
there's this woman that i like a lot.:::['8-15-262']
but, uh, it can't happen.:::['8-15-263']
she's not a tribbiani?:::['8-15-264']
so, uh... so is she someone from work?:::['8-15-266']
well, um, does she like you?:::['8-15-268']
sometimes i think maybe she could.:::['8-15-269']
but it doesn't matter, i can't do anything about it.:::['8-15-270']
it's complicated.:::['8-15-272']
she was with this other guy. for a long time.:::['8-15-273']
someone from work too.:::['8-15-274']
i could never do that to the guy. we're friends.:::['8-15-276']
so, uh, this guy she used to go out with, is he still in love with her?:::['8-15-277']
no, i don't think so. okay.:::['8-15-278']
is he a good guy?:::['8-15-279']
yeah, he's the best.:::['8-15-280']
then talk to him. he might be fine. i don't know.:::['8-15-281']
it's worth finding out, if you really like her.:::['8-15-282']
i do, so much.:::['8-15-283']
i can't stop thinking about her. i can't sleep...:::['8-15-284']
okay, joey, you know what? you have to go for it.:::['8-15-285']
how often does this happen to you? you owe it to yourself.:::['8-15-286']
here's your warm milk.:::['8-15-287']
i'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.:::['8-15-288']
anyway, seriously, just talk to the guy, okay?:::['8-15-290']
let me know how it goes.:::['8-15-291']
it's rachel.:::['8-15-292']
rachel: you're gonna have a baby and you need to be prepared.:::['8-15-293']
you're gonna make yourself watch the whole thing. just do it!:::['8-15-294']
heh, i came to the big city to become a star.:::['8-15-295']
i'll do anything to make that happen.:::['8-15-296']
rachel: hmm. maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.:::['8-15-297']
joey? are you in there?:::['8-17-0']
oh, my god, that's rachel. joey, you have to talk to her.:::['8-17-1']
no, i can't. not after the other night. it's just... it's too weird, okay?:::['8-17-2']
don't tell her i'm here.:::['8-17-3']
don't eat that.:::['8-17-4']
hey. chandler: rach.:::['8-17-5']
monica: hey, rachel. is joey here?:::['8-17-6']
i don't see him. you see him? i don't see him.:::['8-17-7']
maybe he's in the sugar bowl. joey? nope.:::['8-17-8']
well, at least you make each other laugh.:::['8-17-9']
what's up? well, i haven't seen him since that night......that he told me how he, you know...:::['8-17-10']
i don't know, i think he's avoiding me.:::['8-17-11']
why is that bagel on the floor?:::['8-17-12']
we were playing a game. ew, was chandler naked?:::['8-17-13']
sort of like a ring-toss kind of situation?:::['8-17-14']
sure. what? no. no.:::['8-17-15']
all right, well, listen. if you see joey, will you just tell him that, uh?:::['8-17-16']
tell him i miss him.:::['8-17-17']
okay. did you hear that? yeah. that naked bagel game? heh.:::['8-17-18']
dude, i don't know. that's a pretty small hole.:::['8-17-19']
honey, you've gotta talk to her. i can't.:::['8-17-20']
you guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that......and then just get shot down.:::['8-17-21']
i don't know what that's like?:::['8-17-22']
up until i was 25, i thought the only response to "i love you" was "oh, crap.":::['8-17-23']
hello. no rejection?:::['8-17-24']
i got shot down at fat camp.:::['8-17-25']
boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.:::['8-17-26']
all right, so, what do i do?:::['8-17-27']
this is rachel. what are you gonna do, never talk to her again?:::['8-17-28']
i know it's weird and it's awkward, but you gotta at least try.:::['8-17-29']
whoa. i almost forgot this was on your... we didn't play it.:::['8-17-31']
okay, so when you're done with your tea, i'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.:::['8-17-32']
i didn't know you read tea leaves. oh, yeah, i've done it for years.:::['8-17-33']
i actually stopped because i was so accurate.:::['8-17-34']
you know, and one of the great joys of life......is its wondrous unpredictability,you know?:::['8-17-35']
and also, tea tends to give me the trots.:::['8-17-36']
okay. i'm done. read mine. okay.:::['8-17-37']
ooh. i see a ladder.:::['8-17-38']
which can mean either a promotion or a violent death.:::['8-17-39']
i'm the head chef. i can't get promoted.:::['8-17-40']
mm-hm. mm-hm. who's next?:::['8-17-41']
okay, i'm done. do mine.:::['8-17-42']
um... oh. okay, i see a circle. oh.:::['8-17-44']
oh, which can either mean you're having a baby......or you're gonna make:::['8-17-45']
a scientific discovery.:::['8-17-46']
well, i have been spending a lot of time in the lab.:::['8-17-47']
what does yours say, pheebs? um... wow, all right.:::['8-17-48']
wow. yay.:::['8-17-49']
oh, i'm gonna meet a guy. and really soon.:::['8-17-50']
and he's gonna be the man of my dreams.:::['8-17-51']
probably not the guy i had a dream about last night.:::['8-17-52']
hey, has anyone seen my shirt?:::['8-17-54']
it's a button-down, like a faded salmon color?:::['8-17-55']
you mean your pink shirt?:::['8-17-56']
faded salmon color?:::['8-17-57']
no, i haven't seen your pink shirt.:::['8-17-58']
great, great. then i must have left it at mona's. i knew it.:::['8-17-59']
i'm sure you can get another one at ann taylor's.:::['8-17-60']
that's my favorite shirt, okay? i love that shirt.:::['8-17-61']
well, just ask mona to give it back.:::['8-17-62']
i don't know. i mean, i guess i could.:::['8-17-63']
it's just, we didn't really end things on such good terms.:::['8-17-64']
and if i went over there, i'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do......when we broke up::::['8-17-65']
jump up my own ass and die.:::['8-17-66']
oh, wait a second, you guys.:::['8-17-67']
for the last couple weeks, i've been seeing that guy everywhere i go.:::['8-17-68']
we take the same bus, we go to the same bookstore, same dry cleaner.:::['8-17-69']
maybe he's the tea guy.:::['8-17-70']
chandler: pheebs, did you see that?:::['8-17-71']
he totally checked you out and he is so cute.:::['8-17-72']
mine is a picture of the village people. what does that mean?:::['8-17-73']
tea gives phoebe the trots.:::['8-17-76']
i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out......but it's like we don't even know:::['8-17-77']
how to be with each other anymore.:::['8-17-78']
i know it's tough, but things will get better. how do you know that?:::['8-17-79']
what if it just gets worse and worse and worse......to the point where we can't even:::['8-17-80']
be in the same room with each other?:::['8-17-81']
i'm not great at the advice.:::['8-17-82']
can i interest you in a sarcastic comment?:::['8-17-83']
some cheese?:::['8-17-84']
honey, why is the bruce springsteen cd in the cat stevens case?:::['8-17-85']
let's just say if i can't find the right cd case, i just put it in the nearest one.:::['8-17-86']
okay, well, where is the cat stevens cd? in the james taylor case.:::['8-17-87']
where's the james taylor cd? honey, i'm gonna save you some time.:::['8-17-88']
two hundred cds, not one of them in the right case.:::['8-17-89']
okay. no need to panic. deep breaths, everyone.:::['8-17-90']
okay, um, we're just gonna have to spend some time... ...and put the cds in the right cases.:::['8-17-91']
if we're gonna do that, we should come up with some order.:::['8-17-92']
like alphabetically, or by genre.:::['8-17-93']
hmm, i don't know. we really have to talk this through.:::['8-17-94']
oh, my god, you guys have such problems. i feel so terrible for you.:::['8-17-95']
all right. okay, i'm sorry.:::['8-17-96']
look, you and joey, you're both focusing on this uncomfortable thing.:::['8-17-97']
what you need to do is change the subject.:::['8-17-98']
next time you see him, try to get him talking about something else.:::['8-17-99']
oh, yeah, that makes sense. yeah.:::['8-17-100']
i don't know, maybe you have a work problem you need his advice on.:::['8-17-101']
ooh, i could do that. i could do that. good.:::['8-17-102']
honey, the miami vice soundtrack? really?:::['8-17-103']
they were just giving those away at the store.:::['8-17-104']
in exchange for money.:::['8-17-105']
i really don't know what to tell you, rach. i really don't.:::['8-17-108']
maybe joey could help you out with your big work problem.:::['8-17-109']
what? yeah, joey, she's...:::['8-17-110']
rachel's got this really big work problem. it is a head-scratcher. heh.:::['8-17-111']
well, you know what? if we're gonna make dinner, we're gonna have to leave. yeah.:::['8-17-112']
so you, uh, have a big work problem?:::['8-17-113']
yeah. it's, um... yeah, it's, uh...:::['8-17-114']
you know, it's nothing.:::['8-17-115']
so, uh, i think i'm gonna take off.:::['8-17-117']
no, wait, joey, it is. it's something. it's, um...:::['8-17-118']
it's my boss.:::['8-17-119']
yeah? yeah. and, um...:::['8-17-120']
and my baby.:::['8-17-121']
my boss wants to buy my baby.:::['8-17-123']
what? oh, my... oh, my god.:::['8-17-124', '3-20-303']
i know, i told you, it's a really big problem.:::['8-17-125']
he wants to buy your baby? can you believe that?:::['8-17-126']
that's crazy. that's what i told him.:::['8-17-127']
how did this even happen? well, i'll tell you.:::['8-17-128']
see, uh, my boss and, uh, his wife, they can't have children, so, um...:::['8-17-129']
and then when we were at the christmas party......and he got drunk and said to me,"rachel, i want to buy your baby.":::['8-17-130']
man. when you said it was a problem about your boss and the baby......i figured it was something:::['8-17-131']
about maternity leave.:::['8-17-132']
yeah, that would have been a much simpler problem.:::['8-17-134']
oh, hello. oh, it's you. i see you everywhere.:::['8-17-135']
mm-hm. i'm jim. jim nelson.:::['8-17-136']
jim-jim nelson. i'm phoebe-phoebe buffay.:::['8-17-137']
we certainly have been seeing a lot of each other.:::['8-17-138']
we have. maybe we'll see each other at dinner tomorrow. say, around 8:00?:::['8-17-139']
well, maybe we will.:::['8-17-140']
okay, if i were a salmon shirt, where would i be?:::['8-17-144']
i am so sorry i spilled wine all over your shirt.:::['8-17-145']
oh, it's okay. mona: no, it's still wet.:::['8-17-146']
let me get it out before it sets. oh, i have something you could wear.:::['8-17-147']
here. man: oh, uh...:::['8-17-148']
i don't know if i wanna wear a woman's shirt.:::['8-17-149']
no, no, that's a man's shirt. awfully pink.:::['8-17-150']
it's not pink.:::['8-17-151']
oh, my god, honey, we are so meant to be together.:::['8-17-152']
look, we both have the annie soundtrack. honey, both yours.:::['8-17-153']
hey, great advice on that joey thing.:::['8-17-154']
yeah, the work problem? it was perfect.:::['8-17-155']
it felt like he was my friend again.:::['8-17-156']
what problem did you tell him you have? oh, that's not important.:::['8-17-157']
the point is, i really think everything's gonna be okay.:::['8-17-158']
you think you can just buy my friend's baby?:::['8-17-160']
isn't it funny how we kept running into each other?:::['8-17-161']
it's as if someone really wants us to be together.:::['8-17-162']
someone does. me.:::['8-17-163']
ooh. witty banter. well done. good.:::['8-17-164']
so tell me a little bit about yourself. oh, okay. well, i'm a masseuse.:::['8-17-165']
and i used to work at this place... do you like to party?:::['8-17-166']
i... i like parties.:::['8-17-167']
you're wild, aren't you? heh.:::['8-17-168']
yeah, i guess. a little. ain't no thing. i'm wild too.:::['8-17-169']
so, um, anyway......i... i've lived in new york,somewhat wildly, i guess......for, um... well, since i was 14.:::['8-17-170']
i'm sorry. i'm staring.:::['8-17-171']
it's just that you have the most beautiful eyes.:::['8-17-172']
oh, stop it.:::['8-17-173']
and your breasts. mm!:::['8-17-174']
look, uh, you're coming on a little strong.:::['8-17-176']
but i'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt.:::['8-17-177']
because it seems the universe really wants us to be together.:::['8-17-178']
so why don't we start over, okay? you can just tell me about yourself.:::['8-17-179']
i write erotic novels......for children.:::['8-17-181']
what? they're wildly unpopular.:::['8-17-182']
also, you might be interested to know that i have a ph.d.:::['8-17-184']
wow, you do? yep. a pretty huge...:::['8-17-185']
the sun will come out tomorrow:::['8-17-187']
bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow:::['8-17-188']
there'll be sun:::['8-17-189']
hey. hey, joey, honey, listen.:::['8-17-190']
thank you for talking to me yesterday about that thing with my boss.:::['8-17-191']
that really meant a lot. not a problem. oh, and just so you know......that guy's not gonna be bothering you:::['8-17-192']
about that baby thing anymore.:::['8-17-193']
what? let's just say i took care of it.:::['8-17-194']
ooh, let's say more.:::['8-17-195']
don't worry, don't worry. i just told him, very nicely::::['8-17-196']
"you don't go buying people's babies, so back off.":::['8-17-197']
joey, he doesn't wanna buy my baby. i made that up.:::['8-17-200']
what? why?:::['8-17-201', '8-20-249', '9-4-214', '7-18-278', '7-9-223', '5-22-330', '5-7-6', '4-14-142']
so that we would have something to talk about so it wouldn't be awkward.:::['8-17-202']
and you couldn't think of anything else?:::['8-17-203']
you said your boss wants to buy your baby?:::['8-17-204']
i can't believe you yelled at my boss.:::['8-17-205']
i'm gonna lose my job. what am i gonna do?:::['8-17-206']
you could always sell your baby.:::['8-17-207']
joey, i cannot believe you brought my boss into this. i'm gonna get fired.:::['8-17-208']
you lied to me. well, she told me to.:::['8-17-209']
chandler has two copies of annie.:::['8-17-210']
ross! hello.:::['8-17-213']
ross, what are you doing?:::['8-17-214', '9-17-217']
not touching myself, if that makes anyone less uncomfortable.:::['8-17-215']
morning. you wanted to see me?:::['8-17-216']
please, come in. have a seat.:::['8-17-217']
okay, look, mr. zelner... oh, i think it's best that i speak first.:::['8-17-218']
i've asked lee from human resources to be here as a witness to our conversation.:::['8-17-220']
if i in any way implied that i wanted to buy your baby......i am sorry. okay?:::['8-17-222']
last week, when i asked you when your due date was, uh......i certainly did not mean that:::['8-17-223']
i felt that i was due your baby.:::['8-17-224']
yeah, i want to be very clear......that i understand that it's your baby......and it is not mine to purchase.:::['8-17-225']
well, as long as we are clear about that.:::['8-17-226']
oh, there it is.:::['8-17-227', '9-23-149', '7-5-108']
that's not your regular dry cleaners. i know.:::['8-17-228']
but that creep i went on that date with goes there so i had to find a new one.:::['8-17-229']
i also have to find a new video store, a new bank......a new adult bookstore,a new grocery store...:::['8-17-230']
what? a new grocery store.:::['8-17-231']
the universe said i was gonna meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me?:::['8-17-232']
when i get up there, i'm gonna kick some ass.:::['8-17-233']
don't worry, phoebe, you're gonna meet someone.:::['8-17-234']
if i can meet a great guy, so can you.:::['8-17-235']
yeah, we both can. and we both will.:::['8-17-236']
oh, you didn't have to come in with me. are you kidding?:::['8-17-237']
this is where they get out stains. this is like disneyland for me.:::['8-17-238']
i'm gonna be over here watching the dance of the clean shirts.:::['8-17-239']
oh, excuse me. i think you, uh, dropped...:::['8-17-240']
wow. what?:::['8-17-241']
i'm sorry, it's just that you're so incredibly beautiful.:::['8-17-242']
oh, yeah, well, i'm sorry about that too. but what are you gonna do?:::['8-17-243']
i hope you don't think i'm crazy, but i feel like i was meant to pick this up.:::['8-17-244']
do you believe in that kind of thing? a little. heh.:::['8-17-245']
now you're talking.:::['8-17-246']
would you like to go have a cup of coffee? i'd love to. let me just tell my friend.:::['8-17-247']
ooh. an ink stain. hey, can i watch how you get this out?:::['8-17-248']
she must have left.:::['8-17-249']
hi. so, what happened?:::['8-17-250']
it's all gonna be okay.:::['8-17-251']
they're just so happy i'm not suing them......that they gave me one extra month:::['8-17-252']
paid maternity leave.:::['8-17-253']
so long as i understand that the money should not be construed......as a down payment on this:::['8-17-254']
or any other child that i may bear.:::['8-17-255']
wow. ralph lauren is going out of their way......to show that they're not:::['8-17-256']
in the baby-buying business.:::['8-17-257']
chandler, can you give us a minute? oh, i'm sorry.:::['8-17-258']
you're kicking me out of my living room? yeah.:::['8-17-259']
i'll be in there.:::['8-17-260']
joey, i'm really sorry that i lied to you. i was just trying to make things...:::['8-17-261']
but it kind of worked. i mean, you know, i don't know about you......but i haven't thought about our thing:::['8-17-263']
since all this.:::['8-17-264']
yeah. it's kind of been like us again, a little bit.:::['8-17-266']
yeah, i know. i've missed that. me too.:::['8-17-267']
i mean, i haven't thought at all about how i put myself out there......and said that stuff and how:::['8-17-268']
you didn't feel the same way about me......and how it was really awkward.:::['8-17-269']
my gynecologist tried to kill me.:::['8-17-270']
item j437-a.:::['8-17-271']
color: winterberry.:::['8-17-272']
hi, um, listen. come here. come...:::['8-17-273']
i'm so, so sorry about yesterday.:::['8-17-274']
i'm really, really sorry. it's just...:::['8-17-275']
listen, ross, you don't have to apologize. i understand why you were there.:::['8-17-276']
you do? yeah. you still have feelings for me.:::['8-17-277']
and to be honest, i still have feelings for you too......and i wish we could work out, ross,but we can't.:::['8-17-278']
it's too complicated with you and rachel and the baby. i just...:::['8-17-279']
it just wasn't meant to be.:::['8-17-280']
oh, god. you're right.:::['8-17-281']
ross, we have to be strong. mm.:::['8-17-282']
okay, i'm gonna go.:::['8-17-283']
can i? to remember you?:::['8-17-284']
i'm sorry, did you just say it's rachel?:::['8-16-0']
um, you like rachel?:::['8-16-2']
yes. i like rachel.:::['8-16-3']
yeah. okay, but look, you know...:::['8-16-5']
you know who else i like? you.:::['8-16-6']
and it doesn't get said enough. i like you, ross.:::['8-16-7']
"rachel" rachel? it's not a big deal.:::['8-16-8']
it's not a big deal? i'm sorry, i just...:::['8-16-9']
what about the stuff you said?:::['8-16-10']
how you can't stop thinking about her? how you can't sleep?:::['8-16-11']
i'm an actor, you know?:::['8-16-12']
as a group, we tend to be overdramatic.:::['8-16-13']
rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby rachel?:::['8-16-14']
i know it's bad. and i know it's wrong, okay?:::['8-16-15']
it's not like anything's ever gonna happen.:::['8-16-16']
these are just feelings. they'll go away.:::['8-16-17']
you know, i gotta go.:::['8-16-18']
hey, ross...:::['8-16-19']
you know, i just have one... rachel?:::['8-16-20']
oh, oh! okay, she's kicking.:::['8-16-23']
she's growing inside you.:::['8-16-24']
whoa! oh.:::['8-16-25']
that was a big one. that's the youngest girl to reject me.:::['8-16-26']
you guys! hey there.:::['8-16-27']
let me ask you. do you believe in soul mates?:::['8-16-28']
oh, yes, i do.:::['8-16-29']
there's one person out there for everyone.:::['8-16-30']
you know how you find him? stop looking.:::['8-16-31']
i've stopped looking for russell crowe.:::['8-16-32']
he'll find me.:::['8-16-33']
uh-huh. and you?:::['8-16-34']
no. i believe that, uh, certain people are more suited for each other, but...:::['8-16-35']
soul mates? i don't think they exist. good.:::['8-16-36']
why? well, last night, i met monica's.:::['8-16-37']
what? yeah.:::['8-16-38', '7-5-230', '3-5-98']
i had a date with this guy. i swear he's her other half.:::['8-16-39']
you don't think there's somebody better suited for monica than me?:::['8-16-40']
well, what's he like?:::['8-16-41']
he's tall. he has brown hair. of course.:::['8-16-42']
a tall guy with hair similar to mine? oh, unknowable universe!:::['8-16-43']
he works with food. oh, sure. older?:::['8-16-44']
obviously. and he's british. i was just gonna ask!:::['8-16-45']
yeah? and he's so centered, and mature and confident.:::['8-16-46']
it's so sad they never met.:::['8-16-47']
luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear you.:::['8-16-48']
oh, i'm so sorry. maybe i'm wrong.:::['8-16-49']
we're going out again. i'll find out more.:::['8-16-50']
he's meant for her, and you're gonna date him?:::['8-16-51']
he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.:::['8-16-52']
i talked to joey. i wanted to see you.:::['8-16-54']
i still can't believe it. joey and rachel?:::['8-16-55']
it's like you and me going out, only weirder.:::['8-16-56']
i know you're hurting......but don't say that again.:::['8-16-57']
what if they marry? he'd be the stepfather of my child.:::['8-16-58']
you don't need to worry.:::['8-16-59']
he'll never tell her how he feels.:::['8-16-60']
if he did, you don't know how she'd react.:::['8-16-61']
sure, women never like joey. i think he's a virgin.:::['8-16-62']
he isn't thinking about going for her. he's not?:::['8-16-63']
all he's thinking about is how you're taking this.:::['8-16-64']
it's freaking him out. he wants to move to vermont.:::['8-16-65']
why? he wants to leave the country.:::['8-16-66']
he thinks you hate him.:::['8-16-67']
hate him?:::['8-16-68']
no, i don't hate him.:::['8-16-69']
it's just, it's rachel. you know?:::['8-16-70']
i can't even imagine how hard this must be for you......but i don't want you:::['8-16-71']
to lose joey over it.:::['8-16-72']
right now, he needs to know that you're still his friend.:::['8-16-73']
okay, i'll talk to him.:::['8-16-74']
i'd do it soon.:::['8-16-75']
he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money.:::['8-16-76']
oh, hi! hi.:::['8-16-77']
chandler, monica, this is don. hello.:::['8-16-78']
hello, nice to meet you. monica: nice to meet you.:::['8-16-79']
soul mate.:::['8-16-80']
what are you guys doing? we had lunch at adriatica.:::['8-16-81']
what's with the sun-dried tomatoes? i know! is this 1985?:::['8-16-82']
that's what i said! isn't it strange? not really.:::['8-16-83']
what's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?:::['8-16-84']
on a barbecued-chicken pizza?:::['8-16-85']
no?:::['8-16-86', '7-8-191', '10-13-22', '5-17-105', '4-6-313', '4-1-157']
what restaurants do you like? octavio. 27-and-7.:::['8-16-87']
there's this place, alessandro's. oh, my god! i'm the chef!:::['8-16-88']
you're kidding! your food is fantastic!:::['8-16-89']
i want to talk about your menu. anyone want coffee?:::['8-16-90']
if you're talking about me, i'll go with you.:::['8-16-91']
i swear, i didn't know you guys would be here.:::['8-16-93']
you don't believe in soul mates, so...:::['8-16-94']
i believe in handsome strangers who hit on my wife.:::['8-16-95']
just because i think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything'll happen.:::['8-16-96']
phoebe? good work. yeah?:::['8-16-97']
he's great. i love him.:::['8-16-98']
don't worry, we'll find you someone else.:::['8-16-99']
i understand if you came by to hit me. i deserve it.:::['8-16-101']
no, i don't want to hit you.:::['8-16-102']
what, then? kick me?:::['8-16-103']
bite me?:::['8-16-105']
i don't want to do anything to you.:::['8-16-106']
i just want to say i'm not mad at you......and that i certainly:::['8-16-107']
do not hate you.:::['8-16-108']
i just came here to say that.:::['8-16-109']
hey, wait, ross?:::['8-16-110']
you wanna come in for a beer or something?:::['8-16-111']
you got any beer?:::['8-16-113']
all i got is melon stuff that rachel left.:::['8-16-114']
you need to understand something.:::['8-16-116']
i am never gonna act on this rachel thing, okay?:::['8-16-117']
i wouldn't do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.:::['8-16-118']
anyway, it'll just...:::['8-16-121']
it'll take me a while to get over her.:::['8-16-122']
i'm not sure how to do that. i've never been in love, so...:::['8-16-123']
you're in love with her?:::['8-16-125']
yeah. i thought you knew that. um, no.:::['8-16-126']
look, if it helps, i don't want to feel this way, honest.:::['8-16-127']
i just keep thinking, "i'll get over this," you know?:::['8-16-128']
but it just keeps getting harder.:::['8-16-129']
i don't know what to do, you know?:::['8-16-130']
you need to tell her how you feel. that's the green stuff talking.:::['8-16-132']
i'm serious. you need to find out where she is.:::['8-16-133']
if she's not where you are, you can start to move on.:::['8-16-134']
but what if, and i'm not saying she will be...:::['8-16-135']
if she is where you are......then my feeling weird:::['8-16-136']
shouldn't stand in the way.:::['8-16-137']
are you sure? yeah.:::['8-16-138']
if she ends up with somebody else......the truth is,she couldn't find a better guy.:::['8-16-139']
hey, thanks.:::['8-16-140']
so when are you gonna talk to her? oh, my god. i have to tell her.:::['8-16-141']
i haven't thought about it. what should i say?:::['8-16-142']
i'm understanding, but let's not get carried away. right, sorry. sorry.:::['8-16-143']
what am i gonna say?:::['8-16-144', '7-20-174']
yeah, tell me about it.:::['8-16-145']
i'm phasing out the wine importing and focusing more on the, um, cheese.:::['8-16-146']
cheese, you say?:::['8-16-147']
that's some pretty smelly work, huh, don?:::['8-16-148']
excuse me? cheese. it's smelly.:::['8-16-149']
you must smell a lot of the time too.:::['8-16-150']
uh, not really. but with cheese, i think the smellier, the better.:::['8-16-151']
me too! chandler hates it. i can't have blue cheese in the house.:::['8-16-152']
and you're still married to him?:::['8-16-153']
i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheese.:::['8-16-154']
not even bread. just cheese.:::['8-16-155']
no, i want the bread.:::['8-16-156']
and pastries.:::['8-16-157']
and paté.:::['8-16-158']
i'm really not high. i just used to be fat.:::['8-16-159']
i have a villa in the loire valley you can stay in.:::['8-16-160']
is it made of cheese?:::['8-16-161']
no. a house made of cheese, wouldn't that be great?:::['8-16-162']
i'd move in tomorrow! oh, come on!:::['8-16-163']
listen to this! i'm so sorry.:::['8-16-164']
what do we do? they both want a house of cheese.:::['8-16-165']
i don't know how you fight that.:::['8-16-166']
okay, okay. i can do this. i can tell her how i feel.:::['8-16-167']
okay, stand up straight.:::['8-16-168']
take a couple deep breaths.:::['8-16-169']
look confident.:::['8-16-170']
joey? what's up?:::['8-16-171']
i came by because i want to talk to you about something.:::['8-16-172']
here, in the hall? what are we, animals?:::['8-16-174']
i'm late for a meeting. could you make it quick?:::['8-16-175']
i just came by to tell you that......i want to have dinner with you.:::['8-16-176']
sure. just tell me where to meet you. okay.:::['8-16-177']
okay. that's good.:::['8-16-178']
that gives you a couple of hours to prepare.:::['8-16-179']
don't you people ever knock?:::['8-16-180']
i'd like to have don and phoebe over.:::['8-16-181']
sure. set it up.:::['8-16-182']
i'll just be browsing through the personals.:::['8-16-183']
are you okay? you're acting weird.:::['8-16-184']
yeah. fine. not perfect.:::['8-16-185']
but good enough.:::['8-16-186']
jeez, what's with you?:::['8-16-187']
i'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?:::['8-16-188']
what's going on? phoebe says you and don are soul mates.:::['8-16-189']
i don't believe in that, but you two get along.:::['8-16-190']
i'll step aside if you wanna go with don and live in a house of cheese.:::['8-16-191']
you don't believe in soul mates? no, but i'm sure "tomatoes" does.:::['8-16-192']
i don't believe in soul mates, either.:::['8-16-193']
you don't? nope.:::['8-16-194']
we weren't destined to end up together.:::['8-16-195']
we fell in love and work hard at our relationship.:::['8-16-196']
some days we work really hard.:::['8-16-197']
so you don't want to live with don in a cheese house?:::['8-16-198']
no, i've had second thoughts. do you know how hard it'd be to clean?:::['8-16-199']
i love you. i know.:::['8-16-200']
i'm gonna take you out to dinner.:::['8-16-201']
i found this place that makes the greatest mozzarella sticks and jalape?o poppers.:::['8-16-202']
no? they taste so good.:::['8-16-203']
it happens whenever chandler touches my stomach.:::['8-16-204']
i'm worried the baby won't like him.:::['8-16-205']
are you okay? yeah, sure.:::['8-16-206']
uh, look, the reason...:::['8-16-207']
is it hot in here?:::['8-16-208']
no, not for me. why don't you take off your sweater?:::['8-16-209']
this is a nice place......and my t-shirt has a picture:::['8-16-210']
of calvin doing hobbes.:::['8-16-211']
oh, my god, really? can i see it?:::['8-16-212']
i wouldn't think hobbes would like that so much.:::['8-16-214']
how long have we known each other?:::['8-16-216']
um, seven, eight...:::['8-16-217']
eight years. wow.:::['8-16-218']
uh-huh. a long time. yeah.:::['8-16-219']
but over the past few weeks, i...:::['8-16-220']
okay! sorry about the wait, but it is mega-jammed in here.:::['8-16-221']
our specials tonight...:::['8-16-222']
could you give us a second? sure.:::['8-16-223']
second's up!:::['8-16-224']
not that kind of table.:::['8-16-225']
so you were saying?:::['8-16-226']
i'm not sure.:::['8-16-227', '9-12-322', '5-6-248']
you asked how long we knew each other, and i said eight years.:::['8-16-228']
then the waiter came over and cut his tip in half......and now here we are.:::['8-16-229']
yeah. here we are.:::['8-16-230']
i think i'm falling in love with you.:::['8-16-232']
i'm falling in love with you.:::['8-16-234']
who are you talking to?:::['8-16-235', '5-23-182']
oh, you're kidding. it's a joke.:::['8-16-236']
funny. it's funny!:::['8-16-237']
i don't get it.:::['8-16-238', '2-13-6', '4-3-107']
are you, um?:::['8-16-242']
how did, um?:::['8-16-243']
does it really matter?:::['8-16-245']
wow. wow.:::['8-16-246', '7-19-138']
it is hot in here.:::['8-16-247']
i know this is a lot.:::['8-16-248']
you don't have to say anything.:::['8-16-249']
you take as much time as you need.:::['8-16-250']
okay, you gotta say something.:::['8-16-251']
joey, i love you so much.:::['8-16-252']
but... but.:::['8-16-253']
right. hey, that's, uh...:::['8-16-255']
that's okay. that's fine.:::['8-16-256']
it's, uh, pretty much what i was expecting.:::['8-16-257']
it's no big deal, all right?:::['8-16-258']
i think i'm gonna go. please don't leave like this.:::['8-16-259']
you can't do this to a pregnant woman!:::['8-16-260']
don't start doing that.:::['8-16-261']
you can't do that, because you're gonna make me...:::['8-16-262']
oh, there we go!:::['8-16-263']
can i? sure.:::['8-16-264']
oh, joey. i don't want to lose...:::['8-16-265']
you can't, okay? ever.:::['8-16-267']
please don't be sorry.:::['8-16-269']
okay? don't be sorry.:::['8-16-270']
you know, i was only kidding.:::['8-16-271']
yeah, that was a real good one.:::['8-16-272']
is this your table? yeah.:::['8-16-273']
you'll be here all night. i know.:::['8-16-274']
i haven't even read the specials.:::['8-16-275']
i don't know. i think maybe one of them is dying.:::['8-16-277']
i kind of hope it's the girl.:::['8-16-278']
the guy is really cute!:::['8-16-279']
ross, mon, is it okay if i bring someone to your parents' anniversary party?:::['8-18-0']
who's the guy? parker, i met him at the dry cleaners.:::['8-18-2']
did he put a little starch in your bloomers?:::['8-18-3']
who said that?:::['8-18-4']
no, he's really great, though. he has this incredible zest for life.:::['8-18-5']
and he treats me like a queen. except at night, when he treats me like the naughty girl i am.:::['8-18-6']
oh, by the way, would it be okay if i give the toast this year?:::['8-18-7']
are you sure you want to after what happened at their 20th?:::['8-18-8']
yeah, i'd really like to. hopefully this time mom won't boo you.:::['8-18-9']
yes. every year ross makes the toast, and it always makes them cry.:::['8-18-10']
this year, i'm gonna make them cry. you wonder why ross is their favorite?:::['8-18-11']
no, really, any time ross makes a toast, everyone cries and pats him on the back.:::['8-18-12']
and they all come up to me and say, "god, your brother.":::['8-18-13']
you know what they're gonna say this year? "god, you.":::['8-18-14']
well, i can promise you, at least one person will be crying.:::['8-18-15']
i'm an actor, and any actor worth his salt can cry on cue.:::['8-18-16']
really? you can do that? oh, you kidding me? watch.:::['8-18-17']
well, i can't do it with you guys watching me.:::['8-18-18']

while we think it's simply marvelous that you're having this baby out of wedlock......some of our friends:::['8-18-62']
are less open-minded.:::['8-18-63']
which is why we told them you're married. what?:::['8-18-64']
thanks for going along with this.:::['8-18-65']
we have to pretend that we're married? son, i had to shave my ears for tonight.:::['8-18-66']
you can do this.:::['8-18-67']
can you believe that? i know.:::['8-18-68']
if you're gonna do the ears, you may as well take a pass at the nose area.:::['8-18-69']
no, no, i don't want to have to lie about us being married.:::['8-18-70']
i know. i don't either. but it's their party, and it's one night.:::['8-18-71']
we don't even have to lie. we just won't say anything.:::['8-18-72']
if it comes up, we'll smile, we'll nod along...:::['8-18-73']
ross? rachel?:::['8-18-74']
hi, aunt lisa. uncle dan.:::['8-18-75']
congratulations on the baby and on the wedding.:::['8-18-76']
here's something to get you started. so how's marriage treating you?:::['8-18-77']
unbelievable. it's great. i love marriage.:::['8-18-78']
we'll see you later.:::['8-18-79']
ross: hey. all: hi.:::['8-18-80']
what a beautiful place. what a great night.:::['8-18-81']
i have to tell you, being here with all of you in event room c......i feel so lucky. to think of all the:::['8-18-82']
good times that have happened here.:::['8-18-83']
the birthdays, the proms, the mitzvahs, both bar and bat.:::['8-18-84']
but none of it will compare with tonight. my god, i don't want to forget this moment.:::['8-18-85']
it's like i want to take a mental picture of you all. click.:::['8-18-86']
i don't think the flash went off.:::['8-18-87']
i'm gonna go find the men's room. i'll go with you.:::['8-18-88']
somewhere, there is someone with a tranquilizer gun......and a huge butterfly net:::['8-18-89']
looking for that man.:::['8-18-90']
i have to go too, but i don't want him complimenting my thing.:::['8-18-91']
i'm so glad we weren't in the car. did he ever let up?:::['8-18-92']
he called the long island expressway a concrete miracle.:::['8-18-93']
this room. this night.:::['8-18-94']
that waiter. his shoes. i must take a mental picture.:::['8-18-95']
were you guys making fun of parker?:::['8-18-97']
that depends, how much did you hear?:::['8-18-98']
well, he's a little enthusiastic. what's wrong with that?:::['8-18-99']
it's just-- it's so much. well, so what? i like him.:::['8-18-100']
do i make fun of the people you've dated? tag, janice, mona.:::['8-18-101']
no, because friends don't do that. but do you want my opinion?:::['8-18-102']
in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like a who's who of human crap.:::['8-18-103']
i feel terrible. i know.:::['8-18-104']
what was wrong with mona?:::['8-18-105']
open it, open it, open it. yeah, baby.:::['8-18-106']
so we never got to hear about your wedding.:::['8-18-107']
we were surprised we weren't invited. oh, no, it was just our parents. it was a small wedding.:::['8-18-108']
but it was beautiful. it was small, but kind of spectacular.:::['8-18-109']
where did you have it? on a cliff in barbados, at sunset.:::['8-18-110']
and stevie wonder sang "isn't she lovely" as i walked down the aisle. really? yeah.:::['8-18-111']
stevie's an old family friend. oh, my god. that sounds amazing.:::['8-18-112']
i'd love to see pictures. yeah, so would i.:::['8-18-113']
you wouldn't think that annie leibovitz would forget to put film in the camera.:::['8-18-114']
would you excuse us for a second?:::['8-18-115']
um, what are you doing? what? i'm not you.:::['8-18-116']
this may be the only wedding leverhave.:::['8-18-117']
and i want it to be amazing. okay. okay. ooh. ooh.:::['8-18-118']
maybe i rode in on a harley. okay, ross, it has to be realistic.:::['8-18-119']
say, uh, ahem, are you okay? you seem kind of quiet.:::['8-18-120']
no, i'm fine. i'm great. i'm with you. and i'm with you. what a great time to be alive.:::['8-18-121']
look at this plate bouncy thing.:::['8-18-122']
what an inspired solution to man's plate-dispensing problems.:::['8-18-123']
mm-hm. yeah.:::['8-18-124', '3-21-344']
ah. oysters. let me feed you one. that's not necessary.:::['8-18-125']
please? no, actually, i don't eat--:::['8-18-126']
i won't quit until you try one. okay, fine, fine.:::['8-18-127']
mm. mm-hm. good. what're they like? i've never had one.:::['8-18-128']
why don't you just try one? nah, they look too weird.:::['8-18-129']
what are you doing? just going over my toast.:::['8-18-130']
ah, those two will never know what hit them.:::['8-18-131']
i can't wait. they're gonna cry so hard, they'll be fighting for breath.:::['8-18-132']
you know, if you want to, i could just hold them down and you could just::::['8-18-133']
and my veil was lace, made by blind belgian nuns.:::['8-18-134']
blind? well, not at first, but it was intricate work.:::['8-18-135']
and they said even though they lost their sight, it was all worth it.:::['8-18-136']
i bet you looked beautiful. oh, well, i don't know about that.:::['8-18-137']
but there were some people that said i looked like a floating angel.:::['8-18-138']
how did you propose? oh, yeah, that's a great story.:::['8-18-139']
well, um, actually, i took her to the planetarium.:::['8-18-140']
that's where we had our first date.:::['8-18-141']
um, she walked in, and i had the room filled with, uh, lilies, her favorite flower.:::['8-18-142']
aunt lisa: that is so sweet. shh. i want to hear the rest.:::['8-18-143']
then fred astaire singing, uh, "the way you look tonight"......came on the sound system:::['8-18-144']
and the lights came down... ...and i got on one knee......and written across the dome,in the stars, were the words::::['8-18-145']
"will you marry me?":::['8-18-146']
and the ring was the size of my fist.:::['8-18-148']
hey, uh, phoebe? look, uh......i want to apologize about before, okay?:::['8-18-149']
we were being jerks.:::['8-18-150']
parker's a nice guy, and i'd like to get to know him. then you better do it now.:::['8-18-151']
why? because i'm gonna kill him.:::['8-18-152']
what? you guys were right. he's just too excited about everything.:::['8-18-153']
i mean, i'm all for living life, but this is the gellers' 35th anniversary.:::['8-18-154']
let's call a spade a spade. this party stinks.:::['8-18-155']
i know. i'm having the worst time.:::['8-18-156']
there was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when i finally got up to the plates......i slipped on a giant booger.:::['8-18-157']
are you sure it wasn't an oyster?:::['8-18-158']
i guess it could've been. i didn't really look at it.:::['8-18-159']
i just wiped it on chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.:::['8-18-160']
i just thought he was such a great guy. i was so excited about him.:::['8-18-161']
well, hey, you should be excited about him.:::['8-18-162']
there's nothing wrong with him. he's a good guy.:::['8-18-163']
you think? yeah, know what i think?:::['8-18-164']
we were all just being too negative. you're right.:::['8-18-165']
you're right. he's just embracing life. we could all stand to be more like parker.:::['8-18-166']
you know what? i am like him. i'm a sunny, positive person.:::['8-18-167']
actually, you have a little bit of an edge. what's that now?:::['8-18-168']
"bunny hop"]:::['8-18-169']
oh, it's parker. look, the bunny hop.:::['8-18-170']
oh, i love it. you do?:::['8-18-171']
are you kidding? people acting like animals to music? come on.:::['8-18-172']
okay, it's time for the toast.:::['8-18-173']
i know that normally ross gives the toast, but this year i'm gonna do it.:::['8-18-174']
no, it's gonna be great. really.:::['8-18-175']
mom, dad, when i got married......one of the things:::['8-18-177']
that made me sure that i could do it... ...was the amazing example the two of you set for me.:::['8-18-178']
for that, and for so many other things, i wanna say thank you.:::['8-18-179']
i know i probably don't say it enough......but i love you.:::['8-18-180']
when i look around this room... ...i'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be with us.:::['8-18-181']
nana, my beloved grandmother, who would so want to be here.:::['8-18-182']
but she can't......because she's dead.:::['8-18-183']
as is our dog, chi-chi.:::['8-18-184']
i mean, look how cute she is-- was.:::['8-18-185']
do me a favor, pass this to my parents.:::['8-18-186']
remember, um, she's dead, okay? her and nana, gone.:::['8-18-187']
hey, does anybody remember when......debra winger had to say goodbye:::['8-18-190']
to her children in terms of endearment?:::['8-18-191']
didn't see that?:::['8-18-192']
no movie fans?:::['8-18-193']
you want to hear something sad?:::['8-18-194']
um, the other day i was watching 60 minutes... ...and there was this piece on these orphans in romania......who have been so neglected:::['8-18-195']
that they were incapable of love.:::['8-18-196']
you people are made of stone.:::['8-18-197']
here's to mom and dad. whatever.:::['8-18-198']
thank you, monica. that was, uh, interesting.:::['8-18-199']
wasn't it interesting, jack? why don't i remember this dog?:::['8-18-200']
ross? why don't you give us your toast now?:::['8-18-201']
oh, no, mom. it's just monica this year.:::['8-18-202']
you're not gonna say anything? on our 35th wedding anniversary?:::['8-18-203']
no, of course, um...:::['8-18-204']
um, everybody? um, ahem, i just wanted to say......uh, on behalf of my new bride,rachel......and myself, um, that if...:::['8-18-205']
if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are......we'll count ourselves:::['8-18-206']
the luckiest people in the world.:::['8-18-207']
i just wish nana were alive to hear ross' toast.:::['8-18-209']
my god, what a fantastically well-lit hallway.:::['8-18-210']
can i, um, get you something to drink, like a water and valium?:::['8-18-211']
i must say, this apartment, it's...there are no words.:::['8-18-212']
oh, thank god. it's a haven.:::['8-18-213']
a third-floor paradise, a modern-day eden. yeah, i know, i know. uh-huh. gotcha.:::['8-18-214']
listen, why don't we just, um, sit and relax, you know, just be with each other quietly.:::['8-18-215']
that sounds great. uh-huh.:::['8-18-216']
my god, this is the most comfortable couch i've ever sat on in my entire life.:::['8-18-217']
let's try something else. let's play a game.:::['8-18-218']
i love games. shocking.:::['8-18-219']
um, let's play the game of......who can stay quiet the longest.:::['8-18-220']
or jenga.:::['8-18-221']
let's play this one first, and remember, whoever talks first loses.:::['8-18-222']
i lose, now jenga. oh, my god. oh, my god.:::['8-18-223']
is something wrong? wrong? you know the word "wrong"?:::['8-18-224']
everything isn't perfect? everything isn't magical?:::['8-18-225']
everything isn't aglow with the light of a million fairies?:::['8-18-226']
they were just brake lights, parker.:::['8-18-227']
well, excuse me for putting a good spin on a traffic jam.:::['8-18-228']
but you don't have to put a good spin on everything.:::['8-18-229']
i'm sorry. that's who i am. i'm a positive person. no, i'm a positive person.:::['8-18-230']
you are like santa claus on prozac.:::['8-18-231']
at disneyland, getting laid.:::['8-18-232']
so, what do you want me to do? you want me to be more negative?:::['8-18-233']
you want me to be less happy? much less happy.:::['8-18-234']
fine. well, then to quote ross, "i better be going.":::['8-18-235']
so long.:::['8-18-236', '5-18-160']
hey. don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out.:::['8-18-237']
isn't this the most incredible fight you've ever had in your entire life?:::['8-18-238']
we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar.:::['8-18-239']
ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.:::['8-18-240']
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem.:::['8-18-241']
it was really fun being married to you tonight. yeah, and it was the easiest 400 bucks i ever made.:::['8-18-242']
okay, ross, can i, um, ask you something? yeah.:::['8-18-243']
that proposal at the planetarium? i know, i know. it was stupid.:::['8-18-244']
are you kidding? with the lilies, and the song and the stars?:::['8-18-245']
it was really wonderful. did you just make that up?:::['8-18-246']
uh, no, actually, i thought about it when we were going out.:::['8-18-247']
that's how i imagined i, uh, would ask you to marry me.:::['8-18-248']
well, that would've been, uh, very hard to say no to.:::['8-18-250']
well, it's a good thing i didn't do it... ...because it sounds like it would have been a very expensive wedding.:::['8-18-251']
okay, good night. good night.:::['8-18-252']
uh, even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?:::['8-18-253']
i will think about it. that's all i'm asking.:::['8-18-254']
okay, that's it. i give up.:::['8-18-255']
at mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.:::['8-18-256']
you know, i don't understand why they didn't cry. it was a beautiful speech.:::['8-18-257']
oh, come on. hey. that stuff you said about true love?:::['8-18-258']
you were right. i mean, we did learn a lot from mom and dad.:::['8-18-259']
and that picture of chi-chi with her mischievous grin.:::['8-18-260']
and what you said about nana? oh, yeah, she really would've wanted to be there.:::['8-18-261']
i think she was.:::['8-18-263']
how the hell do you do it'?:::['8-18-264']
narrator: previously on friends::::['8-24-0', '10-15-0', '10-17-0', '4-24-0']
seventeen hours, i have been at this.:::['8-24-1']
how many centimeters am i dilated? three.:::['8-24-2']
just three? i'm dilated three.:::['8-24-3']
we've talk about having babies someday. so we're gonna try?:::['8-24-4']
right here? no, not here.:::['8-24-5', '8-23-158']
maybe here.:::['8-24-6', '8-23-159']
this is your grandmother's engagement ring.:::['8-24-7']
i want you to give it to rachel.:::['8-24-8']
mom, no. ross, this isn't just some girl......you picked up in a bar and humped.:::['8-24-9']
hey, i take it you're visiting someone? uh-huh, yeah.:::['8-24-10']
wanna visit someone else? yeah, i would like that.:::['8-24-11']
that's him. great. well, go get him.:::['8-24-12']
or maybe you could go in first.:::['8-24-13']
hi, i'm dr. drake ramoray. i have a few routine questions.:::['8-24-14']
do you sleep with women and never call them again?:::['8-24-15', '8-23-251']
should we tell rachel there's an empty, private room right next door to hers?:::['8-24-17']
we could. or we could have sex in it.:::['8-24-18']
well, let me think about that. while i remove my pants.:::['8-24-19']
okay, mister. fertilize me.:::['8-24-20']
does that sound like janice?:::['8-24-21']
if it's not, then there's two of them.:::['8-24-22']
and that would mean it's the end of the world.:::['8-24-23']
h93'-:::['8-24-24', '8-24-242', '8-21-175', '9-17-32', '10-14-133', '10-14-278', '10-16-159']
i can't believe this is taking so long. how are you doing?:::['8-24-26']
oh, not bad. you know that feeling... ...when you're trying to blow a saint bernard out your ass?:::['8-24-27']
weirdest thing. did i hear--?:::['8-24-28']
mother of god, it's true.:::['8-24-29']
chandler bing.:::['8-24-30', '9-9-4', '9-13-80', '2-13-47']
notjust janice. janice in labor. contracting and everything.:::['8-24-32']
oh, this should be easy. i have a very wide pelvis.:::['8-24-33']
you remember, chandler.:::['8-24-34']
janice, i didn't know you were pregnant.:::['8-24-35']
who's the unwitting human whose essence you've stolen?:::['8-24-36']
it's you.:::['8-24-37']
this is yours.:::['8-24-38']
ha, look how nervous he gets! we haven't slept together in years!:::['8-24-40']
that's funny. does it hurt? does the labor hurt?:::['8-24-41']
okay, i've got one for you. if you had to, which would you rather eat?:::['8-24-42']
a seeing eye dog or a talking gorilla?:::['8-24-43']
i'd have to say the talking gorilla.:::['8-24-44']
because at least i could explain to him that you're making me eat him.:::['8-24-45']
oh. somebody went to college. yeah.:::['8-24-46']
wow. what is it? i'm sorry.:::['8-24-47']
oh, i'm sorry. it's just my foot itches like crazy.:::['8-24-48']
on. i'll get it.:::['8-24-49']
wow. i usually get to know a girl better before i let her spoon me.:::['8-24-50']
relax. it's not like we're forking.:::['8-24-51']
ow, ow, ow, ow!:::['8-24-52']
oh, that's five, ross. five women have had five babies......and i have had no babies.:::['8-24-53']
why doesn't she want to come out?:::['8-24-54']
you know what i think it is? i think you made such a nice home for her......over the last nine months:::['8-24-55']
that she just doesn't want to leave.:::['8-24-56']
oh. look at you making up crap for me.:::['8-24-57']
oh, god. ooh, ooh... okay. okay.:::['8-24-58']
twenty-one hours. you're a hero.:::['8-24-59']
doctor, you gotta do something. you gotta give me drugs......or you gotta light a fire up in there:::['8-24-60']
and just smoke it out.:::['8-24-61']
actually, i think you're ready to go to the delivery room.:::['8-24-62']
what? ten centimeters.:::['8-24-63']
you're about to become a mom.:::['8-24-64']
oh, my god. okay.:::['8-24-65']
ha-ha-ha, beat you, sucker. oh, baby.:::['8-24-66']
oh, my god. that's the doctor who was in my room before.:::['8-24-67']
oh. okay, mr. percocet.:::['8-24-68']
i'm telling you, the guy from that show was here......in my room,asking me all these weird questions.:::['8-24-69']
cliff, do you really believe that a character from a tv show was here in your room?:::['8-24-70']
rachel's having her baby.:::['8-24-71']
that's him. you know him?:::['8-24-72']
okay. okay. i-- okay. um... this--:::['8-24-73']
i sent my friend, joey, in here to find out stuff about you.:::['8-24-74']
um, if it, you know-- if it helps, you came off great.:::['8-24-75']
a lot better than i'm coming off right now.:::['8-24-76']
i don't believe this. you got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?:::['8-24-77']
fake? excuse me? hello?:::['8-24-78']
and then you tried to make me think that i was crazy? you're right, that was wrong. i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.:::['8-24-79']
it's just that i liked you so much. can we just start over?:::['8-24-80']
uh, if i may? look, cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right?:::['8-24-82']
now, maybe it would help if you knew some personal stuff about her.:::['8-24-83']
uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer.:::['8-24-84']
uh, she gave birth to her brother's triplets.:::['8-24-85']
oh, oh, oh. her twin sister used to do porn.:::['8-24-86']
joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy. right.:::['8-24-87']
look, we don't really know each other, so it'd be really easy to just forget this......but there seems to be something:::['8-24-89']
between us. and i don't know about you......but that doesn't happen to me a lot.:::['8-24-90']
it doesn't happen to me, either. me, neither.:::['8-24-91']
push.push. rachel: ooh, ooh, ooh... we're gonna push for five more seconds.:::['8-24-92']
five, four...:::['8-24-93']
three, two, one. oh!:::['8-24-94']
okay, the next contraction should be in about 20 seconds.:::['8-24-95']
i can't. i can't push anymore. sweetie, you're doing great.:::['8-24-96']
oh, god. twenty seconds, my ass!:::['8-24-97']
here we go. okay, keep pushing.:::['8-24-98']
come on. push. wait.:::['8-24-99']
i see something. what, you do? you do? oh, my god.:::['8-24-100']
don't say "oh, my god." "oh, my god," what? what is that?:::['8-24-101']
that's the baby's buttocks. she's breech.:::['8-24-102']
oh, my god. i thought she had two heads. rachel: oh, god.:::['8-24-103']
is she gonna be okay?:::['8-24-104']
doctor: she's gonna be fine. yeah.:::['8-24-105']
she's in a more difficult position, so you're gonna have to push harder.:::['8-24-106']

oh, no. baby girl geller-green.:::['8-24-133']
hello, baby girl.:::['8-24-134']
phoebe: can we come in? oh, come on in.:::['8-24-135']

oh, my god. she's amazing.:::['8-24-138']
oh, i'm so glad you guys got drunk and had sex.:::['8-24-139']
it's incredible. i mean, one minute she's inside you......and then 47 hours later, here she is.:::['8-24-140']
she looks so real.:::['8-24-141']
you know what i mean.:::['8-24-142', '3-22-190']
okay, my turn. my turn. aunt phoebe.:::['8-24-143']
yes. oh, baby. oh, you're so cute.:::['8-24-144']
oh, i could squeeze your little head.:::['8-24-145']
i won't.:::['8-24-146', '10-16-152']
honey, what's the matter? nothing. sorry, i just can't stop crying.:::['8-24-147']
the doctor said it's completely normal, with the hormones...:::['8-24-148']
...plus you're sleep-deprived. so? you guys are all sleep-deprived.:::['8-24-149']
i don't see you weeping because you put your slippers on the wrong feet.:::['8-24-150']
what's the matter now? i was reliving it.:::['8-24-152']
so do you know what you're gonna call her yet?:::['8-24-154']
oh. wait a minute, it's not gonna be baby girl? i thought that was so original.:::['8-24-155']
uh, actually, we've narrowed it down to two names.:::['8-24-156']
yeah, and you know what? i love them both. so why don't you just pick one, and that'll be it.:::['8-24-157']
wow, um, okay. uh, everyone?:::['8-24-158']
this is isabella.:::['8-24-159']
hi, isabella. hi.:::['8-24-160']
what? that's not her name.:::['8-24-161']
i'm sorry, she just doesn't feel like an isabella.:::['8-24-162']
what was the other one, ross? um, delilah.:::['8-24-163']
oh, great. suddenly she sounds like a biblical whore.:::['8-24-164']
ahem, so i guess we're back to baby girl. yay.:::['8-24-165']
what are we gonna do?:::['8-24-166', '9-12-281', '7-7-284']
it's okay, honey. you'll find a name. ugh. easy for you to say.:::['8-24-167']
you already know what your kids' names are gonna be.:::['8-24-168']
you do? yeah. i had them picked out since i was 14.:::['8-24-169']
oh, no, it's gonna be named after some snack or baked good, isn't it?:::['8-24-170']
well, tell us, what are they? um, okay. if it's a boy, it's daniel.:::['8-24-171']
and if it's a girl? i don't want to say.:::['8-24-172']
oh, stop. tell us. we're not gonna want it.:::['8-24-173']
okay. it's emma.:::['8-24-174']
emma.:::['8-24-175', '9-8-144', '10-9-120']
see, i don't want it.:::['8-24-176']
take it. what?:::['8-24-177']
she's clearly an emma.:::['8-24-178']
oh, honey, but you love that name.:::['8-24-179']
yeah. but i love you more.:::['8-24-180']
besides, you know, nothing goes with bing. so i'm screwed.:::['8-24-182']
yoo-hoo.:::['8-24-183']
aaron lipman-guralnick would like to say hello to his future bride.:::['8-24-184']
wow, he kind of takes your breath away, doesn't he?:::['8-24-186']
he's a keeper. ha, ha.:::['8-24-187']
how are you feeling? oh, you know, i'm fine.:::['8-24-188']
can i just say, i really admire what you're doing. just raising her all alone.:::['8-24-189']
oh, i'm not doing it alone. i have ross.:::['8-24-190']
oh, sure. now. but what happens when he meets somebody else and gets married?:::['8-24-191']
well, then he gets a divorce. it's ross.:::['8-24-192']
i'm telling you, rachel. listen to janice.:::['8-24-193']
they all say they're gonna be there, until they start their real family.:::['8-24-194']
that's never gonna happen with ross. that's what i thought about my first husband.:::['8-24-195']
now, i'm lucky if my kid gets to spend the weekend with her father......and little miss new-boobs.:::['8-24-196']
i hate to be the one to say it......but, honey, you two are on your own.:::['8-24-198']
well, that's, you know, that's...:::['8-24-199']
we've been alone for the last 20 minutes and we're doing okay.:::['8-24-200']
you know what? maybe we won't be alone.:::['8-24-201']
because lately things have been happening... ...between me and ross, you know?:::['8-24-202']
and right before i went into labor, we had this kiss. you know?:::['8-24-203']
so it might be the beginning of something.:::['8-24-204']
hey, janice. oh, hi.:::['8-24-205']
oh. who's this little guy?:::['8-24-206']
say hello to aaron, your future son-in-law. oh, no, no. ha, ha.:::['8-24-207']
i'm gonna leave you three alone. both: okay.:::['8-24-208']
man, you see the kid on that nose? uh-huh.:::['8-24-209']
you know what i was thinking about? huh?:::['8-24-210']
um, that kiss before we left the apartment. that was something, huh?:::['8-24-211']
yeah. yeah, it really was.:::['8-24-212']
but we, we gotta be careful. heh.:::['8-24-213']
we-- you know, we can't let that happen again, you know?:::['8-24-214']
we don't want to go down that road, do we? no. no, of course not. no, that's why i brought it up.:::['8-24-216']
they didn't have any sodas? oh, my god. i'm sorry.:::['8-24-217']
i was talking to this nurse. completely forgot.:::['8-24-218']
and so it begins.:::['8-24-219']
phoebe: she in there?:::['8-24-220']
yeah. she's putting her down now. that's her.:::['8-24-221']
ross: look at emma. i can't decide who she looks more like.:::['8-24-223']
you or rachel?:::['8-24-224']
oh, what, are you kidding? she's gorgeous. it's all rachel.:::['8-24-225']
i'm sorry. for the last time, why aren't you two together again?:::['8-24-226']
no, i know. because you're not in that place.:::['8-24-227']
which would be fine, except you totally are.:::['8-24-228']
it's complicated, okay?:::['8-24-229']
yeah, that's true. yeah, you love her, you always have......you have a child together.:::['8-24-230']
there's no right answer.:::['8-24-231']
look, we've been together. okay, and then apart. and then together, and then apart.:::['8-24-232']
and now we have a baby.:::['8-24-233']
it's just, if we got together again and it didn't work out?:::['8-24-234']
i could never do that to emma.:::['8-24-235']
i mean, she came into this world thinking everything-- now me.:::['8-24-236']
what, do they put something in the water in this place?:::['8-24-237']
it's just, rachel and i, we're doing really well now.:::['8-24-238']
i know, i know, i know. if you try to make it more, you might wreck it.:::['8-24-239']
yeah, exactly. right.:::['8-24-240']
or you might get everything you've wanted since you were 15.:::['8-24-241']
i just saw a woman breastfeeding both of her twins at the same time.:::['8-24-243']
it is like a freak show up here.:::['8-24-244']
what's the matter? nothing.:::['8-24-245']
what is it? hey?:::['8-24-246']
really, it's nothing. i'm... rach, come on. what?:::['8-24-247']
i've just been thinking about how my baby and i are gonna be all alone.:::['8-24-248']
what are you talking about: "alone"? what about ross?:::['8-24-249']
oh, please. he'll be with his real family. the twins and little miss new-boobs.:::['8-24-250']
okay, how long was i watching that woman?:::['8-24-251']
i'm just saying that, you know......someday ross is gonna:::['8-24-252']
meet somebody......and he's gonna have his own life.:::['8-24-253']
yeah, i guess so.:::['8-24-255']
i just never thought i'd be raising this baby all by myself.:::['8-24-256']
pretty dumb, huh?:::['8-24-257']
hey, you listen to me. listen to me.:::['8-24-258']
you are never, ever gonna be alone.:::['8-24-259']
okay? i promise i won't let that happen.:::['8-24-260']
oh, joey. oh, sweetie, what would i do without you?:::['8-24-261']
you don't have to worry about that, okay?:::['8-24-262']
oh, honey, could you grab me my other box of tissues?:::['8-24-263']
they're right on that chair under ross' coat. sure.:::['8-24-264']
that was amazing. i know.:::['8-24-269']
hey, do you realize that we may have just changed our lives forever?:::['8-24-270']
we may have started our family.:::['8-24-271']
nine months from now, we could be here......having our own baby.:::['8-24-272']
and if not, we got to do it on a bucket.:::['8-24-273']
so i'm in my apartment doing the soap opera digest crossword puzzle......and guess who is the clue:::['8-19-1']
for three down?:::['8-19-2']
three down. "days of our lives star, blank tribbiani.":::['8-19-3']
that's me! i'm blank! hey.:::['8-19-4']
how cool is. we know three down. i'm touching three down.:::['8-19-5']
yeah, you are, baby.:::['8-19-6']
three down knows i'm married.:::['8-19-7']
what's three down doing? sorry.:::['8-19-8']
so do they call you to tell you your name's gonna be in this?:::['8-19-9']
no. they really liked me there.:::['8-19-10']
they wanted to do a profile on me. i said no.:::['8-19-11']
why'd you say no?:::['8-19-12']
remember what happened the last time i did an interview?:::['8-19-13']
i said i write a lot of my own lines, then the writers got mad......and made my character fell down:::['8-19-14']
the elevator shaft.:::['8-19-15']
so who knows what i might say this time?:::['8-19-16']
if only there was something in your head to control the things you say.:::['8-19-17']
oh, come on, joey, you'll totally keep it in check this time.:::['8-19-18']
and plus, you know, the publicity would be really good for your career.:::['8-19-19']
and you deserve that.:::['8-19-20']
and if you do the interview, you could mention......oh, i don't know, gal pal rachel green.:::['8-19-21']
is that "gal pal" spelled l-o-s-e-r?:::['8-19-22']
okay, don't listen to him. please?:::['8-19-23']
fine, all right, i'll do it.:::['8-19-24']
but, hey. you guys have to be at the next table......so you can stop me if i,you know, start to say something stupid.:::['8-19-25']
just then or all the time? because we have jobs, you know?:::['8-19-26']
come on, we will be there for you the whole time. just remember::::['8-19-27']

no. we're just four people with neck problems, who talk like this.:::['8-19-35']
i think it's great that you wanted to meet here.:::['8-19-36']
when most people hear that the magazine's paying for it......they want a big, fancy restaurant.:::['8-19-37']
actually, i didn't know the magazine was paying.:::['8-19-38']
wouldn't have mattered.:::['8-19-39']
i'm doing this for the fans, not the free food. ha, ha.:::['8-19-40']
can i get you anything? i'll have a cup of coffee.:::['8-19-41']
yeah, and i'll have all the muffins.:::['8-19-42']
hey. shh. we're not talking.:::['8-19-43']
oh, finally. ugh.:::['8-19-44']
so according to your bio, you've done quite a bit of work before days of our lives.:::['8-19-45']
anything that you're particularly proud of?:::['8-19-46']
all you want is a dingle:::['8-19-47']
what you envy's a shwang:::['8-19-48']
or play with, or simply let hang:::['8-19-50']
folks, this ever happen to you? you go to the fridge to get a glass of milk......but these darn cartons:::['8-19-51']

boy, you said it, mike. i don't--:::['8-19-53']
there's gotta be a better way. and there is, kevin.:::['8-19-55', '3-4-7']
he's never used this product before.:::['8-19-56']
you're gonna see how easy this is to do. go ahead.:::['8-19-57']
this works in any milk carton. wow, it is easy.:::['8-19-58']
now i can have milk every day. crowd: ah.:::['8-19-59']
so this is it, victor?:::['8-19-60', '3-22-318']
yeah, i guess it is. and so......i'm gonna get on this spaceship......and i'm gonna go to blargon 7:::['8-19-61']
in search of alternative fuels.:::['8-19-62', '3-22-326']
but when i return 200 years from now, you'll be long gone.:::['8-19-63']
but i won't have aged at all.:::['8-19-64']

shh, shh. okay, here i come. here i come. see, i'm coming to fix the copier.:::['8-19-69']
i can't get to the copier. i'm thinking, "what do i do? what do i do?":::['8-19-70', '2-4-191']
so i just watch them have sex. and then i say-- wait, here's my line::::['8-19-71']
you know, that's bad for the paper tray.:::['8-19-72']
nice work, my friend. wait, wait, wait, you see me again.:::['8-19-73']
hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.:::['8-19-74']
there i am. there i am. there i am.:::['8-19-75', '2-4-197']

take up the whole river.:::['8-19-83']
get out of the way, jackass!:::['8-19-84', '7-3-92']
who names their boat coast guard, anyway?:::['8-19-85', '7-3-93']
that is the coast guard.:::['8-19-86']
what are they doing out here? the coast is all the way over there.:::['8-19-87']
hi. hey, check it out. this is unbelievable.:::['8-19-88']

well, i see you've had a very productive day.:::['8-19-91', '5-7-336']
don't you think the cowboy hat is a little much?:::['8-19-92']
come on, it's fun.:::['8-19-93']
isn't this a woman's hat?:::['8-19-95', '5-7-340']
dude, stop talking crazy and make us some tea.:::['8-19-96']
you know what? we have to turn off the porn.:::['8-19-97']
i think you're right.:::['8-19-98']
chandler: all right, ready? joey: one.:::['8-19-99']
chandler: two, three. joey: three.:::['8-19-100']

a mento? you know, a mento. a role model.:::['8-19-107']
a mento? right.:::['8-19-108']
like the candy? as a matter of fact, i do.:::['8-19-109']
well, um, another thing that our readers always want to know......is how soap stars:::['8-19-110']
stay in such great shape.:::['8-19-111']
do you have some kind of a fitness regime?:::['8-19-112']
uh, we stars usually just try to eat right and get lots of exercise.:::['8-19-113']
wow, you realize we've been throwing this ball without dropping it for an hour?:::['8-19-114', '5-21-39']
i realized it a half-hour ago, but i didn't want to say anything......because i didn't want to jinx it.:::['8-19-116']
wow, we are pretty good at this. yeah.:::['8-19-117']
hey, we totally forgot about lunch.:::['8-19-118', '5-21-43']
oh. i think that's the first time i've ever missed a meal.:::['8-19-119']
yeah, i think my pants are a little loose.:::['8-19-120']
what's wrong with you?:::['8-19-121']
oh, i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before.:::['8-19-122']
and then i, uh, passed out.:::['8-19-123']
i haven't been able to stand up since. ha, ha. but i don't think it's serious.:::['8-19-124']
this sounds like a hernia. you have to-- go to the doctor.:::['8-19-125']
look, if i go to the doctor for anything......it's gonna be for this thing:::['8-19-127']
damn you, 15's.:::['8-19-130']
what is it? it's a trifle. it's got all of these layers.:::['8-19-131']
first, there's a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam.:::['8-19-132']
then custard, which i made from scratch.:::['8-19-133']
then raspberries, more ladyfingers......then beef sautéed:::['8-19-134']
with peas and onions.:::['8-19-135']
then a little bit more custard.:::['8-19-136']
are you kidding? what's not to like? custard, good.:::['8-19-139']
oh, look. there's a piece that doesn't have floor on it.:::['8-19-146', '7-11-327']

hey, you're the one who loves the picture.:::['8-19-313']
hey, guys. i got some bad news. rachel: what?:::['8-21-0']
that's no way to sell newspapers. try, "extra! extra! read all about it!":::['8-21-1']
no. monica's restaurant got a horrible review in the post.:::['8-21-2']
all: oh, no!:::['8-21-3']
i didn't want her to see it, so i ran around and bought all the copies i could find.:::['8-21-4']
man, this is bad. and i've had my share of bad reviews.:::['8-21-5']
i still remember my first good one::::['8-21-6']
"everything else in this production of our town was simply terrible.:::['8-21-7']
joey tribbiani was abysmal.":::['8-21-8']
oh, my god! look at all the newspapers.:::['8-21-10']
it must be a good review. is it great?:::['8-21-11']
but the good news is, no one in a two-block radius will ever know.:::['8-21-14']
what about the rest of manhattan? yeah, they all know.:::['8-21-15']
oh, my god, this is horrible. i'm sorry. i'm so humiliated.:::['8-21-16']
but you know what they say, there is no such thing as bad press.:::['8-21-17']
you don't think that, um, "the chef's mahi-mahi was awful-awful" is bad press?:::['8-21-18']
i didn't write it.:::['8-21-19']
god, is he right? am i awful? all: oh, no!:::['8-21-20']
hey, monica, listen to me, okay?:::['8-21-21']
i'm not saying this because i'm your friend, i say it because it's true.:::['8-21-22']
your food is abysmal!:::['8-21-23']
ross? what? what?:::['8-21-24']

how come you're not going? i've got a job interview to get ready for.:::['8-21-47']
i thought you already have a job. and people say you don't pay attention.:::['8-21-48']
this is a much better job. it's vice president of the company......that does data reconfiguration......and statistical factoring:::['8-21-49']
and for other companies.:::['8-21-50']
wow. how do you know how to do that? that's what i do now.:::['8-21-51']
joey? come taste this. joey: what is it?:::['8-21-52']
remember the guy that gave me a bad review? well......i'm getting my revenge.:::['8-21-53']

before we go to the movies, i want to make him try my bouillabaisse again.:::['8-21-56']
ugh, i can't wait to read the front page tomorrow::::['8-21-57']
"restaurant reviewer admits: 'i was wrong about monica."':::['8-21-58']
the front page?:::['8-21-59']
you really do live in your own little world, don't you?:::['8-21-60']
do you want these delivered, mr. and mrs. geller?:::['8-21-61']
oh, no, no, no. no, no. ross: heh. no, no.:::['8-21-62']
we're not married. we are having a baby together......but we're not involved.:::['8-21-63']
i mean, uh, we-- we were seeing each other a while ago......but then we were just friends,and then there was one drunken night...:::['8-21-64']
or, yes, stranger, we'd like this delivered, please.:::['8-21-65']
why don't you fill out this address card? oh, okay.:::['8-21-66']
i noticed you picked out a lot of dinosaurs. rachel: oh, yeah.:::['8-21-67']
that's one of the reasons why we are not a couple.:::['8-21-68']
i chose those. i'm a paleontologist.:::['8-21-69']
really? that is so cool.:::['8-21-70']
oh, don't get too worked up over it. it sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.:::['8-21-71']
oh, no. i'm fascinated by paleontology.:::['8-21-72']
have you read the walter alvarez book? yeah, heh, i teach it in class.:::['8-21-73']
oh, my god. standing at a cash register, i'm holding a credit card, and i'm bored.:::['8-21-74']
i love your neighborhood. there's a great gym around the corner from your building.:::['8-21-75']
that's my gym. i could tell you work out.:::['8-21-76']
a paleontologist who works out. you're like indiana jones.:::['8-21-77']
i am like indiana jones.:::['8-21-78']
hi, pheebs. hey! oh, how did baby shopping go?:::['8-21-79']
it was great! we got everything we needed.:::['8-21-80']
oh, and ross almost got something that wasn't on the list.:::['8-21-81']
ahem, a whore.:::['8-21-82']
what? we were paying for our stuff......and this sales woman:::['8-21-83']
just started flirting with him.:::['8-21-84']
can you believe that?:::['8-21-85', '5-23-240']
did she know you two weren't married? yeah.:::['8-21-86']
oh, my god. well, the idea-- a woman flirting with a single man?:::['8-21-87']
we must alert the church elders. no.:::['8-21-88']
you don't understand. you didn't see how brazen she was.:::['8-21-89']
sounds like you're a little jealous. no, i'm not.:::['8-21-90']
i just think it's wrong. i mean, here i am, about to pop......and he's out picking up:::['8-21-91']
some shopgirl at sluts-r-us?:::['8-21-92']
is that a real place?:::['8-21-93']
are they hiring?:::['8-21-94']
hey, phoebe. fatty. wha--?:::['8-21-95']
hey, chandler, why so fancy?:::['8-21-96']
well, i got a job interview. big deal, too.:::['8-21-97']
it's more money. i'd be doing data reconfiguration and statistical factoring.:::['8-21-98']
i think i know someone who does that. me. i do that.:::['8-21-99']
so seriously, do i look okay? i'm nervous.:::['8-21-100']
oh, yeah. you-- really, you look great.:::['8-21-101']
you know, just don't get your hopes up.:::['8-21-102']
why not? well, the interview.:::['8-21-103']
what about it? you know.:::['8-21-104']
you don't make a very good first impression.:::['8-21-105']
what? oh, you don't know.:::['8-21-106']
are you serious? yes. when i first met you, you were like::::['8-21-107']
i was like::::['8-21-108']
what is it that i do?:::['8-21-110']
it's just, like, you're trying too hard, always making jokes.:::['8-21-111']
you just-- you come off a little needy.:::['8-21-112']
did you like me when we first met?:::['8-21-113']
chandler, i'm not gonna lie to you. but i am gonna run away from you.:::['8-21-114']
hi. i'm monica geller, chef at allessandro's.:::['8-21-115']
still?:::['8-21-116']
i think the things you said were unfair......and i would like you to give:::['8-21-117']
my bouillabaisse another chance.:::['8-21-118']
i don't see any reason why i'd do that to myself again.:::['8-21-119']
either eat it or be in it.:::['8-21-120']
sp0on?:::['8-21-121']
so, what do you think? i'm torn......between my integrity:::['8-21-122']
and my desire to avoid a beating.:::['8-21-123']
but i must be honest. your soup is abysmal.:::['8-21-124']
thattagirll eh? we should get out of here, there's a new class coming in.:::['8-21-125']

your alfredo's dry. did you use your cheese?:::['8-21-176']
when you say "use," do you mean "eat as a pre-cooking snack"?:::['8-21-177']

hats off to who now? the chef!:::['8-21-185']

i think you'll find if i work here that i don't micromanage. i don't shy away from delegating.:::['8-21-187']
mm-hm. that's good to know. but let's stop focusing on what you don't do......and focus on what you do do.:::['8-21-188']
what i do do......is manage to, uh,create an atmosphere of support......for the people working with me.:::['8-21-189']
i see. nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.:::['8-21-190']
hardest thing i've ever done in my life. oh, you gotta go!:::['8-21-191']
okay, don't worry. you're ready. really?:::['8-21-192']
absolutely! just fight all your natural instincts, and you'll be great.:::['8-21-193']
ah, monica, my star student.:::['8-21-194']
heh. you called me that before... ...so i took the liberty of fashioning a star out of foil.:::['8-21-195']
now, no pressure. if you like my cookies, you give me the star.:::['8-21-196']
mm. mm-mm-mm.:::['8-21-197']
wow, a star!:::['8-21-198']
i know you all hate me, and i'm sorry, but i don't care.:::['8-21-199']

oh, my god! this is amazing!:::['8-21-201']

i got an a? in school? hey, i'm a dork!:::['8-21-203']
joey, i'm so proud of you.:::['8-21-204']
i think you should give him your star. excuse me?:::['8-21-205']
he doesn't even know what he's doing. we're all beginners.:::['8-21-206']
nobody knows what they're doing. i do. i'm a professional chef!:::['8-21-207']
oh, relax. it's not a courtroom drama.:::['8-21-208']
what are you doing taking introduction to cooking?:::['8-21-209']
i'm sorry. it's just that, um, i cook at this restaurant, allessandrds......and, um, i just got:::['8-21-211']
a really bad review.:::['8-21-212']
oh, allessandro's? i love that place! you do?:::['8-21-213']
yes, you're an excellent chef. as a person you're a little--:::['8-21-214']
oh, totally crazy, but you liked the food? ha, ha. very much.:::['8-21-215']
okay, then. i don't stink. i'm a good chef! okay.:::['8-21-216']
whoa, whoa, whoa, i don't want to go. i'm having fun.:::['8-21-217']
actually, did either of you pay for this class?:::['8-21-218']
hey, if my friend says it's time to go, it's time to go!:::['8-21-219']
also, i was the point person on my company's transition... ...from the kl5 to gr6 systems.:::['8-21-220']
you must have had your hands full. that i did. that i did.:::['8-21-221']
so let's talk a little bit about your duties.:::['8-21-222']
my duties?:::['8-21-223']
you'll be heading a whole division, so you'll have a lot of duties.:::['8-21-225']
i see. but there'll be 30 people under you......so you can dump:::['8-21-226']
a certain amount on them.:::['8-21-227']
good to know. we could go into detail--:::['8-21-228']
no, don't, i beg of you.:::['8-21-229']
all right, then. we'll have a definite answer for you on monday.:::['8-21-230']
but i can say with some confidence, you'll fit in well here.:::['8-21-231']
really? absolutely.:::['8-21-232', '10-2-31']
you can relax. you did great. i gotta say, thank you.:::['8-21-233']
i was really nervous. i'm told i come on too strongly, too many jokes.:::['8-21-234']
and then it was really hard to side step that "duty" thing.:::['8-21-235']
duties?:::['8-21-236']
doodies?:::['8-21-237']
poo?:::['8-21-238', '8-21-239', '8-21-243']
oh, my god. this doesn't count. okay? the interview was over.:::['8-21-240']
that was the real chandler bing. this is some crazy guy in the hall.:::['8-21-241']
call security! there's a crazy guy out in the hall!:::['8-21-242']
i'll look forward to your call.:::['8-21-244']
_h6y- _h6y-:::['8-21-245', '8-22-162', '9-19-291', '9-13-103', '9-15-130']
you're back from your date. how are you?:::['8-21-246']
i'm fine. but that's not important. what's important is how was she?:::['8-21-247']
uh, it was fun. we just had coffee.:::['8-21-248']
oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee, a little rub-rub-rub under the table?:::['8-21-249']
heh, what's going on? do you not like katie?:::['8-21-250']
no. no, she was nice. i mean, she was a little slutty, but who isn't?:::['8-21-251']
well, i liked her.:::['8-21-252']
of course you did. you'd date a gorilla if it called you indiana jones.:::['8-21-253']
did you get a fresh batch of pregnancy hormones today?:::['8-21-254']
no. it's just that-- katie bothered me.:::['8-21-255']
why? what was wrong with her?:::['8-21-256']
ugh, there was nothing wrong with her. all right? she was perfectly lovely.:::['8-21-257']
okay. so, what's the matter? i don't want you to date her.:::['8-21-258']
heh, what? why? what, are you jealous?:::['8-21-259']
yes. and not because i want you to go out with me.:::['8-21-260']
because i don't want you to go out with anybody.:::['8-21-261']
i know it's a terrible thing to even think this and it's inappropriate......but i want you to be at my constant:::['8-21-262']
beck and call, 24 hours a day.:::['8-21-263']
i'm very sorry, but that is just the way that i feel.:::['8-21-264']
i won't date. i'll, uh...:::['8-21-266']
i'll be here with you all the time.:::['8-21-267']
but i'm being so unreasonable.:::['8-21-269']
true, but you're allowed to be unreasonable. you're having our baby.:::['8-21-270']
oh, ross, thank you. thank you.:::['8-21-272']
you feel better?:::['8-21-273']
no, not really. you're pressing the baby into my bladder......and now i have to pee. sorry.:::['8-21-274']
okay. rash?:::['8-21-275']
yeah? just one thing. um...:::['8-21-276']
we live together. you're having our baby. i'm not gonna see anybody else.:::['8-21-277']
are you sure you don't want something more?:::['8-21-278']
wow. i don't know, maybe--:::['8-21-279']
oh, rach, i was just messing around. heh.:::['8-21-280']
like you did when i had to pee? oh! ha! i knew that.:::['8-21-281']
i knew that! i was just messing with you too!:::['8-21-282']
okay. because for a minute you seemed...:::['8-21-283']
no, no, no, no. no! it's just-- ha! ...like you actually...:::['8-21-284']
that's just because i'm such a good messer! ah! ah, heh.:::['8-21-285']
rash? yeah?:::['8-21-286']
the bathroom? right.:::['8-21-287']
i had a great time. i learned how to bake, ate great food.:::['8-21-288']
the first a i've gotten since 7th grade and i didn't have to sleep with the teacher.:::['8-21-289']
oh, look. acting for beginners. yeah.:::['8-21-290']
wanna feel good about yourself?:::['8-21-291']
what the hell! okay.:::['8-21-292']
all right, let's start with some basics.:::['8-21-293']
can anybody tell me what the difference between upstage and downstage is?:::['8-21-294']
yeah, this was a stupid idea.:::['8-21-295']
so, what's the final head count on my baby shower?:::['8-20-1']
about 20. a couple people from work who had something else to do.:::['8-20-2']
also, your sisters called, neither can make it.:::['8-20-3']
what? you mean they're not coming to a social event......where there's no men and no booze?:::['8-20-4']
that's shocking.:::['8-20-5', '10-5-413']
well, i don't care. as long as my mom's here.:::['8-20-6']
oh, my god. your mother. what, my mom's not gonna be here?:::['8-20-7']
well, given that we forgot to invite her... ...it would be an awfully big coincidence if she was.:::['8-20-8']
well, it wasn't my fault. phoebe was in charge of the invitations.:::['8-20-10']
well, i don't have a mother. so often i forget other people--:::['8-20-11']
oh, give it a rest.:::['8-20-12']
so my mother is not coming to my baby shower?:::['8-20-13']
neither is mine.:::['8-20-15']
you know what? don't worry. okay? we'll take care of it. we'll call her. you go home and get ready.:::['8-20-16']
please make sure she comes. it's really important to me. it's my mom.:::['8-20-17']
i know. what's her number? i don't know.:::['8-20-18']
go. i have it in my book. go.:::['8-20-19']
wait a minute. if you're in charge of invitations, why am i calling her?:::['8-20-20']
hello, mrs. green. hi, uh, it's monica geller.:::['8-20-21']
oh, hello, monica. monica: hi.:::['8-20-22']
um, i know this is last-minute, but we've decided to throw an impromptu...:::['8-20-23']
...baby shower for rachel today. i know. my daughters told me about it......when they received their impromptu:::['8-20-24']
invitations a month ago.:::['8-20-25']
okay, i'm sorry. i'm so sorry. sandra: for what, dear?:::['8-20-26']
for not inviting me, or for lying about it?:::['8-20-27']
oh, my god. my ass is sweating.:::['8-20-28']
please, please, can you come? it's today at 4.:::['8-20-29']
well, all right. i'll see you at 4. thank you.:::['8-20-30']
isn't it at 3? son of a bitch.:::['8-20-31']
hey, joe. wanna shoot some hoops? joey: hey.:::['8-20-32']
no, i can't go, i'm practicing. i got an audition to be the host of a game show.:::['8-20-33']
cool. great.:::['8-20-34']
yeah, and if i get it, by day, i'll be dr. drake ramoray.:::['8-20-35']
but by night, i'll be joey tribbiani.:::['8-20-36']
you'll be perfect for this. that's already your name.:::['8-20-37']
the audition's in a couple hours, and i don't even understand the game.:::['8-20-38']
do you want some help?:::['8-20-39']
oh, really? that'd be great. hey, you guys can be the contestants.:::['8-20-40']
awesome.:::['8-20-41', '9-6-8', '9-7-183']
okay, i guess we can lose to junior-high girls some other time.:::['8-20-42']
all right. let's play bamboozled. bamboozled?:::['8-20-43']
isn't that a cool name?:::['8-20-44']
ross: yeah. chandler: no.:::['8-20-45']
all right. uh, okay. our first contestant is ross geller.:::['8-20-46']
why don't you tell us a little bit about yourself, ross?:::['8-20-47']
well, uh, i'm a paleontologist. um, i live in new york.:::['8-20-48']
i have a son, ben. uh, hi, ben. and, uh--:::['8-20-49']
i said a little bit, ross. now, how about you, chandler?:::['8-20-50']
well, joey, i'm a headhunter. i hook up out-of-work soviet scientists......with rogue third world nations.:::['8-20-51']
hi, rasputin.:::['8-20-52']
excellent. let's play bamboozled. chandler, you'll go first.:::['8-20-53']
what is the capital of colombia? bogoté.:::['8-20-54']
it's bogoda, but close enough.:::['8-20-55']
now, you can either pass your turn to ross or pick a wicked wango card.:::['8-20-56']
what does a wicked wango card do? i should know that.:::['8-20-57']
let's see. just one moment, please, um...:::['8-20-58']
here we are. a wicked wango card determines whether you go higher or lower.:::['8-20-59']
higher or lower than what?:::['8-20-60']
this is embarrassing. can you believe how lame this is?:::['8-20-61']
i'm sorry. i don't believe contestants are allowed to talk to each other.:::['8-20-62']
oh, i told the stripper to be here at 5. that's good, right?:::['8-20-63']
you ordered a stripper for the shower? that is totally inappropriate.:::['8-20-64']
why? he's gonna be dressed as a baby.:::['8-20-65']
oh, hi, mrs. green. i'm so glad you could make it.:::['8-20-66']
yes, thank you so much. and again, we're so sorry. we could not feel worse about it.:::['8-20-67']
try.:::['8-20-68']
there's my little girl.:::['8-20-69']
she's still mad. yeah, i know.:::['8-20-70']
isn't it great? one less person we have to make small talk with.:::['8-20-71']
phoebe, sandra's mad at you too. it doesn't bother you?:::['8-20-72']
look, we've apologized twice. i can't do any more than that.:::['8-20-73']
i know you hate it when people are mad at you......but, you know,you just have to be okay with it.:::['8-20-74']
okay. i can do that. heh.:::['8-20-75']
i gotta go powder my ass. oh.:::['8-20-76']
look at that face. just like when you were in high school.:::['8-20-77']
if i didn't know better, i'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble.:::['8-20-78']
come on, let's get some tea. okay.:::['8-20-79']
ooh, my. look at that. only three weeks to go.:::['8-20-80']
now, have you picked your nanny yet? i don't want you to just use your housekeeper... ...because it'll just split her focus.:::['8-20-81']
oh. actually, i'm not gonna use a nanny. and, uh, i don't even have a housekeeper.:::['8-20-82']
it's like you're a cave person.:::['8-20-83']
rachel, you must get a nanny. you don't know how overwhelming this is gonna be.:::['8-20-84']
when you were a baby, i had full-time help. i had mrs. k.:::['8-20-85']
mrs. k. oh, yeah, she was sweet. she taught me spanish.:::['8-20-86']
i actually think i remember some of it::::['8-20-87']
such a sweet woman. yeah.:::['8-20-88']
well, however great she was, i just can't afford that.:::['8-20-89']
oh, rachel. what?:::['8-20-90']
i just had the greatest idea. i'm gonna come live with you.:::['8-20-91']
oh, i'm so happy i'm gonna do this for my little girl.:::['8-20-93']
aw, look at you. you have tears in your eyes.:::['8-20-94']
yes, yes, i do.:::['8-20-95']
all right, ross, you're in the lead.:::['8-20-96']
would you like to take another question, or spin the wheel of mayhem?:::['8-20-97']
the wheel has not been my friend tonight, joey. uh...:::['8-20-98']
i'll take another question.:::['8-20-99']
okay. this is gonna be tough. hold your breath.:::['8-20-100']
it's okay. i'm ready.:::['8-20-101']
no, dude, you gotta hold your breath till you're ready to answer the question.:::['8-20-102']
it's part of the game. this is ridiculous. he's not gonna hold--:::['8-20-103']
okay. what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia? triska...:::['8-20-104']
holy cow. that's a big word. tris...:::['8-20-105']
seriously, look at this thing, chandler. how do you say that?:::['8-20-106']
let me see that. this one right here.:::['8-20-107']
triskaidekaphobia. fear of triscuits.:::['8-20-108']
no. no. fear of the number 13. fear of triscuits?:::['8-20-109']
it's possible. they have really sharp edges.:::['8-20-110']
all right, chandler, you're up.:::['8-20-111']
wait a minute. i believe i'm entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn.:::['8-20-112']
this game makes no sense. you're just upset because you're losing.:::['8-20-113']
oh, come on, ross. i think we're all losers here.:::['8-20-114']
all right. chandler, you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card.:::['8-20-115']
let me think, let me think. oh, uh, i don't care.:::['8-20-116']
you must choose, mr. bing.:::['8-20-117']
either. it makes no difference. choose, you jackass.:::['8-20-118']
i'll take a card. okay, you picked the gimme card.:::['8-20-119']
you get all of ross' points. what?:::['8-20-120']
this game is kind of fun.:::['8-20-121']
you don't think it's a little crazy that you get all my points--?:::['8-20-122']
i don't think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other.:::['8-20-123']
why did you invite my mother? monica: what?:::['8-20-124']
she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby.:::['8-20-125']
for how long? eight weeks.:::['8-20-126']
i mean, i love my mother, but, my god, a long lunch with her is taxing.:::['8-20-127']
i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me.:::['8-20-128']
she can't hear you.:::['8-20-129']
you guys, come on. what am i gonna do?:::['8-20-130']
if you don't want your mother to move in with you, just tell her.:::['8-20-131']
you're right. you're right. i'm about to have a baby.:::['8-20-132']
i can tell my mother that i don't want her to be sleeping on my couch.:::['8-20-133']
oh, my god. she's gonna wanna sleep in my bed with me. this cannot happen.:::['8-20-134']
that's right. that is right.:::['8-20-135']
you go over there and tell her you do not want her to live with you.:::['8-20-136']
do not take no for an answer. okay.:::['8-20-137']
this is great. now she's gonna be mad at rachel.:::['8-20-138']
and i'm just gonna swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had.:::['8-20-139']
i have new respect for chandler.:::['8-20-140']
phoebe: all right, everybody. it's time to open the presents.:::['8-20-141']
yes, and i think that the first gift that rachel opens......should be from the grandmother:::['8-20-142']
of the baby.:::['8-20-143']
because you're the most important person in this room. and in the world.:::['8-20-144']
well, um, i don't have a gift because i wasn't invited until the last minute.:::['8-20-145']
but thank you so much, dear, for bringing that to everybody's attention.:::['8-20-146']
how about you less important people? let's open your presents.:::['8-20-147']
mom, it's okay that you didn't get a gift. well, i kind of did.:::['8-20-148']
me. eight weeks of me. yeah.:::['8-20-149']
okay. see, mom, the truth is, i can do this on my own.:::['8-20-150']
sweetheart, i know you're gonna be a terrific mom.:::['8-20-151']
i just think you need a little help, especially at the beginning.:::['8-20-152']
but, mom, i really know what i'm doing. i can handle this.:::['8-20-153']
really? remember twinkles?:::['8-20-154']
he was a hamster. i'm not gonna vacuum up my baby.:::['8-20-155']
okay, come on, rach. it's present time.:::['8-20-156']
you know, you're the glue holding this whole party together.:::['8-20-157']
it's kind of falling apart here.:::['8-20-158']
ooh, look. rachel: wow.:::['8-20-159']
this is from your friends at work.:::['8-20-160']
ooh, my gosh. oh, wow. oh, i know what this is.:::['8-20-161']
that can't be right.:::['8-20-163']
is that a beer bong for a baby?:::['8-20-164']
darling, that's a breast pump.:::['8-20-165']
heh. did i say i was done guessing? okay, thank you for that.:::['8-20-166']
ooh, wow. what's this?:::['8-20-167']
it's a diaper genie. oh, it dispenses clean diapers.:::['8-20-168']
no, it's where you put dirty ones.:::['8-20-169']
well, that's gross. why don't you just take it outside and throw it in a dumpster?:::['8-20-170']
you're gonna do that 10 times a day? what, it goes 10 times a day?:::['8-20-171']
what are we feeding this baby, indian food?:::['8-20-172']
no, dear. that's what babies do.:::['8-20-173']
rachel, listen to your mother. she is very smart.:::['8-20-174']
plus, what are you planning on doing with the baby while you trot out to the garbage?:::['8-20-175']
i don't know, i'd leave it on the changing table?:::['8-20-176']
what? what did i do? what did i do? you can't leave a baby alone.:::['8-20-177']
of course, i know that.:::['8-20-178']
i mean, of course you never leave a baby alone. ha, ha.:::['8-20-179']
i mean, it would-- she wouldn't be safe.:::['8-20-180']
you know, not as safe as she would be with me, the baby dummy. ha, ha.:::['8-20-181']
okay, you know what? opening the presents is a little overwhelming right now.:::['8-20-182']
so i think, um, i'm just gonna maybe open them all a little bit later.:::['8-20-183']
but thank you all for coming, and for these beautiful gifts...:::['8-20-184']
...and this basket is beautiful. it's actually a bassinet.:::['8-20-185']
okay, mommy, don't ever leave me.:::['8-20-186']

so, um, you're gonna stay with me as long as i need you?:::['8-20-213']
of course i am. mom, i swear i'm not an idiot.:::['8-20-214']
i read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth.:::['8-20-215']
but i just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.:::['8-20-216']
and, guess what, the baby's coming......and i don't know what to do.:::['8-20-217']
oh, can i throw up in my diaper genie?:::['8-20-218']
oh, sweetie, you're gonna be fine.:::['8-20-219']
wait, where you going? i'm going to the bathroom.:::['8-20-220']
now, don't worry. everything's gonna be okay.:::['8-20-221']
it is gonna be okay.:::['8-20-222']
worth a shot.:::['8-20-223']
hey. phoebe: hey.:::['8-20-224', '9-11-149', '7-7-258', '10-14-191', '10-17-234', '4-20-216']
why are you all red and sweaty?:::['8-20-225']
i just bamboozled chandler.:::['8-20-226']
which is not a sexual thing.:::['8-20-227']
well, that was a quick shower. not if you were here.:::['8-20-228']
wow, looks like we got a lot of good stuff.:::['8-20-229']
we did. but my mom got us the greatest gift of all.:::['8-20-230']
a play-doh barbershop?:::['8-20-231']
no. she's going to live with us for eight weeks.:::['8-20-232']
yes. she's gonna help us take care of the baby. woo-hoo.:::['8-20-234']
you're not serious.:::['8-20-235']
i mean, she's a very nice woman... ...but there's no way we can take eight weeks of her.:::['8-20-236']
she'll drive us totally crazy-- hi, ross.:::['8-20-237']
hey, joey, hi, i'm ray. i'm the producer of the show.:::['8-20-239']
it's a pleasure to meet you, ray.:::['8-20-240']
and this is duncan and erin. they're gonna help out with the audition. so let's get the camera rolling.:::['8-20-241']
righty-0, ray. whenever you're ready.:::['8-20-242']
hello. i'm joey tribbiani. let's play bamboozled.:::['8-20-243']
erin, you get the first question. in hockey, who is known as "the great one"?:::['8-20-244']
wayne gretzky. correct.:::['8-20-245']
now, would you like to pick a wicked wango card or spin the wheel of mayhem?:::['8-20-246']
uh, joey, didn't your agents give you the revised rules?:::['8-20-247']
we've eliminated all that. no wheel. no cards.:::['8-20-248']
well, the game was too complicated and research showed people didn't follow it.:::['8-20-250']
what's complicated? you spin the wheel of mayhem to go up the ladder of chance......past the mud hut through the:::['8-20-251']
rainbow ring to get to the golden monkey.:::['8-20-252']
you yank his tail, and boom, you're in paradise pond.:::['8-20-253']
yeah. all that's gone.:::['8-20-254']
um, it's basically just a simple question-and-answer game now.:::['8-20-255']
well, what's fun about that?:::['8-20-256']
you expect me to be the host of a boring game... ...that's just people standing around answering questions?:::['8-20-257']
well, there'll be women in bikinis holding up the scores.:::['8-20-258']
let's play bamboozled.:::['8-20-259']
and all those dinosaur knickknacks you have......ross, i thought they might be:::['8-20-260']
more at home in the garage.:::['8-20-261']
well, we don't have a garage. did i say garage? i meant garbage.:::['8-20-262']
you know what, mrs. green? maybe it's not absolutely vital that you live with us.:::['8-20-263']
well, rachel needs help with the baby. i do. i really do. i don't know anything.:::['8-20-264']
i'm sure that's not true.:::['8-20-265']
oh, no? pheebs, monica, do i know anything about babies?:::['8-20-266']
nope. not a thing. mm-mm. it's frightening.:::['8-20-267']
well, um, you know what? even if she doesn't know anything, i do.:::['8-20-268']
i have a son. his mother and i didn't live together.:::['8-20-269']
whenever he was with me, i took care of him all the time, by myself.:::['8-20-270']
that's true. you do have another child. yeah.:::['8-20-271']
with another woman.:::['8-20-272']
have you no control, ross?:::['8-20-273']
that's a different issue.:::['8-20-274']
um, the point is, when the baby comes, i will be there to feed her......and bathe her and change her.:::['8-20-275']
and more than that, i want to do all those things.:::['8-20-276']
well, then you don't need me to live with you.:::['8-20-277']
yes. you're gonna be so missed.:::['8-20-279']
you're gonna be a great father. well, you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.:::['8-20-280']
hello? i still don't know what the hell i'm doing.:::['8-20-281']
come on, every first-time mother feels that way.:::['8-20-282']
you're gonna pick it up. hey, you will. look, when you first came to the city......you were this spoiled,helpless little girl......who still used daddy's credit cards,remember?:::['8-20-283']
i hope you're going somewhere with this.:::['8-20-284']
look at you. you're this big executive.:::['8-20-285']
you are much more capable than you give yourself credit for.:::['8-20-286']
i have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.:::['8-20-287']
really? i'm telling you.:::['8-20-288']
all right, you two. i'm gonna get going.:::['8-20-290']
ross: oh. oh, no, sweetheart, you stay put.:::['8-20-291']
i'll let myself out. it's like i'm not here. which i almost wasn't.:::['8-20-292']
you're just so funny. you're so funny. what do i do?:::['8-20-293']
nothing. you have apologized to her like a million times.:::['8-20-294']
and she's been nothing but terrible to you.:::['8-20-295']
and don't forget, you just threw her daughter... ...a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.:::['8-20-296']
and she hasn't even thanked you for it. you know what? you're right.:::['8-20-297']
yeah, i mean, if you wanna say anything to her, i'd tell her off.:::['8-20-298']
okay, i will.:::['8-20-300', '5-2-207']
mrs. green?:::['8-20-301', '8-20-302']
it is rude to leave a party without saying goodbye to the host.:::['8-20-303']
and also, when someone apologizes to you... ...the decent thing to do is to accept it.:::['8-20-304']
because what i did to you, it wasn't on purpose.:::['8-20-305']
but what you're doing to me now is plain spiteful.:::['8-20-306']
spiteful? monica: that's right.:::['8-20-307']
maybe it's time you took a good, hard look in the mirror, young lady.:::['8-20-308']
old lady.:::['8-20-309']
lady.:::['8-20-310']
wrap it up. wrap it up. wrap it up.:::['8-20-311']
so whenever you're ready to apologize to me, i will forgive you. good day.:::['8-20-312']
i can't feel my legs.:::['8-20-313']
you were fantastic. i'm so proud of you.:::['8-20-314']
yeah? i'm proud of me too. you should be.:::['8-20-315']
could you get me something to drink? you got it.:::['8-20-316']
mrs. green? okay, i'm really sorry. i apologize. if you just-- aah!:::['8-20-317']
okay. i bit my tongue.:::['8-20-318']
but i'm still really sorry.:::['8-20-319']
okay, i'm ready. you sure?:::['8-20-320']
yes. i've done my studying, and i really know my stuff.:::['8-20-321']
all right, then.:::['8-20-322', '3-19-21']
rachel green, let's play bamboozled.:::['8-20-323']
how do you test the temperature of the baby's bathwater?:::['8-20-324']
uh, put your elbow in it. excellent.:::['8-20-325']
how do you put a baby down for a nap? full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.:::['8-20-326']
that's correct.:::['8-20-327', '7-12-94']
this is an audio question. what do you do when a baby makes this sound::::['8-20-328']
uh, check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it.:::['8-20-329']
excellent. now, do you want another question or a wicked wango card?:::['8-20-330']
a card. a card. i pick a card. oh, i'm sorry.:::['8-20-331']
you've been bamboozled. you're gonna be a terrible mother.:::['8-20-332']
i've lost sight of why we're doing this.:::['8-20-333']
a poster for that wwi movie i'm in. check it out.:::['8-22-1']
wow! it looks really violent!:::['8-22-2']
i know. i'm coming soon to a theater near you.:::['8-22-3']
i'm in thx. i'm unsuitable for children!:::['8-22-4']
i cannot wait to see this. it's generating oscar buzz.:::['8-22-5']
i started that! i thought i did!:::['8-22-6']
i just talked to my agent......and the premiere is next week:::['8-22-7']
and you're all invited!:::['8-22-8']
will we take a limo? sure!:::['8-22-9']
i love taking limos when nobody died.:::['8-22-10']
well, i won't be able to come.:::['8-22-11']
for those who haven't checked their calendars, today's my due date.:::['8-22-12']
i want to thank you guys for how great you've been during this.:::['8-22-13']
i couldn't have done it without you. i loved these last 9 months.:::['8-22-14']
i'm looking forward to the next part......but i am really gonna miss:::['8-22-15']
being pregnant.:::['8-22-16']
that's right. still no baby.:::['8-22-17']
come on, people, make some room.:::['8-22-18']
uh, sweetie, maybe you'd be more comfortable here.:::['8-22-19']
like you haven't done enough.:::['8-22-21']
i know you're miserable. i wish there was something i could do.:::['8-22-22']
i wish i were a sea horse.:::['8-22-23']
because with sea horses, it's the male. they carry the babies.:::['8-22-24']
and then also, um, i'd be far away in the sea.:::['8-22-25']
i have never been so uncomfortable in my entire life.:::['8-22-27']
i know. i remember toward the end--:::['8-22-28']
that's a great story. tell it while you're getting me some iced tea.:::['8-22-29']
oh, god, get out! get out, get out, get out!:::['8-22-31']
let's.:::['8-22-32']
hey, did you have the baby yet?:::['8-22-33']
do you want me to sit on you? because i'll do it.:::['8-22-34']
what are you doing here? they sent me home from work.:::['8-22-35']
they said, "start your maternity leave now. just rest.":::['8-22-36']
you know what? screw them!:::['8-22-37']
if they don't want me there, i'll hang out with you guys.:::['8-22-38']
or you could do volunteer work.:::['8-22-39']
hello? joey, it's estelle.:::['8-22-40', '10-4-223']
i was able to get you and one guest tickets to your premiere.:::['8-22-41']
you told me i could have six tickets. i sold four on ebay.:::['8-22-42']
you'll be sitting next to hotguy372.:::['8-22-43']
so that's it? i only get to bring one guest?:::['8-22-44']
yeah. what time do you want to pick me up?:::['8-22-45']
you hear that? i only get one extra ticket.:::['8-22-47']
so somehow i have to pick between you three and ross.:::['8-22-48']
what about me? you said you didn't want to go.:::['8-22-49']
i would still like to be acknowledged.:::['8-22-50']
because i'm pregnant, i'm invisible? definitely not invisible.:::['8-22-51']
ross didn't care enough to be here, so he's out.:::['8-22-52']
you snooze, you lose. he's not snoozing. he's teaching.:::['8-22-53']
well, then somebody's snoozing.:::['8-22-54']
and, joey, not that this should, uh, affect you at all, but, um, if you pick me......i was planning on wearing:::['8-22-55']
a sequin dress out down to here.:::['8-22-56']
i haven't seen this dress. star in a movie.:::['8-22-57']
pick whoever you want. listen to your heart. what does it tell you?:::['8-22-58']
phoebe.phoebe.phoebe.:::['8-22-59']
i think i want to take chandler.:::['8-22-61']
phoebe,phoebe,phoebe.:::['8-22-62']
you want to take me? yeah, i wish i could take everybody.:::['8-22-63']
but chandler's always supported my career.:::['8-22-64']
he's paid for acting classes, headshots and stuff.:::['8-22-65']
this will be my way of paying you back.:::['8-22-66']
so you're never actually going to pay me back?:::['8-22-67']
just because he paid for your headshots, you're gonna take him?:::['8-22-68']
i don't think you're comprehending just how slutty this dress is.:::['8-22-69']
it's not just the stuff he paid for. it's everything, you know?:::['8-22-70']
he read lines with me. he went with me on auditions.:::['8-22-71']
then he consoled me after i didn't get parts.:::['8-22-72']
you always believed in me, man, even when i didn't.:::['8-22-73']
i always knew you were gonna make it. i'm so proud of you.:::['8-22-74']
thanks, that means a lot to me.:::['8-22-75']
mon, maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress.:::['8-22-76']
i'm gonna go shave. ahem. yeah, well, i'm gonna go, uh, spit.:::['8-22-77']
ugh, i have to pee.:::['8-22-78']
if i don't come out, it's because i've choked to death on the potpourri stink.:::['8-22-79']
you hold her nose, i'll blow in her mouth and the kid'll just--:::['8-22-80']
out of her.:::['8-22-81']
she's a week late. she's got to have it today.:::['8-22-82']
i don't know. i think it's still gonna be a while.:::['8-22-83']
hmm. care to make it interesting?:::['8-22-84']
i bet you she'll have it tomorrow. you're on.:::['8-22-85']
okay, how much? one hundred thousand dollars.:::['8-22-86']
how about 50 bucks? i'll call zurich and move some money.:::['8-22-87']
rachel: all right, whose turn is it to help me get up?:::['8-22-88']
ahem, no one's here.:::['8-22-89']
oh, damn it.:::['8-22-90']
this is exciting. so glamorous! people taking our picture. how do i look?:::['8-22-91']
a little tall. what?:::['8-22-92']
would you crouch down a bit so that i look taller?:::['8-22-93']
it's just so glamorous.:::['8-22-95']
oh, hey, mon? rach is here.:::['8-22-96']
and you're still pregnant.:::['8-22-97']
i'm sorry. i know how uncomfortable you are.:::['8-22-98']
you know what? you look great. aw. yeah, like 50 bucks.:::['8-22-99']
i have to go pee. apparently this baby thinks my bladder is a squeeze toy.:::['8-22-100']
damn it. here's your 50 bucks.:::['8-22-101']
that's interesting that you lost. now, i forget, do you like to lose?:::['8-22-102']
all right, stop it.:::['8-22-103']
double or nothing she has it tomorrow. fine. okay.:::['8-22-104']
until then, general grant, why don't you set up camp right there?:::['8-22-105']
rachel here? we have an appointment. in the bathroom.:::['8-22-106']
rach, we gotta go. rachel: in a minute!:::['8-22-107']
people ask why we're not together. i just don't know what to tell them.:::['8-22-108']
rachel: all right, all right, let's go.:::['8-22-109']
ross: uh, do you want to go change first?:::['8-22-110']
the doctor's keeping the office open late for us, but if you hurry...:::['8-22-111']
no, i'm fine. you don't think that's inappropriate?:::['8-22-112']
what? good god, man. don't anger it.:::['8-22-113']
ross, it is 100 degrees outside. for the first time in weeks, i am--:::['8-22-114']
fine. whatever you want. you're the mommy.:::['8-22-115']
uh-uh, pal! don't call me "mommy.":::['8-22-116']
it's bad enough you call your own mother that.:::['8-22-117']
i'm actually with her on this one.:::['8-22-118']
i thought i knew who the enemy was--:::['8-22-119']
okay, this is it. this is my big fight scene coming up.:::['8-22-120']
man in the 82nd ground division.:::['8-22-121']
ross? yeah?:::['8-22-122', '5-19-300']
can i ask you something? uh-huh.:::['8-22-123']
when carol was pregnant with ben... mm-hm?:::['8-22-124']
...were you this irritating?:::['8-22-125']
wow. excuse me? uh, nothing. you're just, uh...:::['8-22-126']
you've been a little short with me lately. i'm not trying to irritate you.:::['8-22-127']
well, then, you must have a natural talent for it.:::['8-22-128']
the doctor will be in soon. why don't we not speak until then?:::['8-22-129']
seriously. breathe louder, ross. that's great.:::['8-22-131']
we should ask the doctor if she even knows......how to deliver a baby:::['8-22-132']
that's half human, half pure evil!:::['8-22-133']
hi, dr. long. how are you? hello. you're nice to her.:::['8-22-134']
she has the drugs.:::['8-22-135']
we'll do a quick check. okay.:::['8-22-136']
eight days late, huh? rachel: yeah. you must be getting uncomfortable.:::['8-22-137']
yeah, just a tad.:::['8-22-138']
you're 80 percent effaced. you're on your way. it still could last a while.:::['8-22-139']
there are ways to help things along. do them!:::['8-22-140']
actually, they're things you can do. home remedies.:::['8-22-141']
in my experience, i've found some are very effective.:::['8-22-142']
well, we are ready to try anything. there's an herbal tea you can drink.:::['8-22-143']
you can take some castor oil. there's spicy foods.:::['8-22-145']
we will do all of those.:::['8-22-146']
taking a long walk. good. done.:::['8-22-147']
and there's the one that's proved most effective: sex.:::['8-22-148']
you've got to be kidding me.:::['8-22-149']
good job, joe! well done! top-notch!:::['8-22-150']
you liked it'? you really liked it? oh, yeah!:::['8-22-151']
well, which part exactly? the whole thing! here we go!:::['8-22-152']
no, no, no. give me some specifics.:::['8-22-153']
i loved the specifics. the specifics were the best part.:::['8-22-154']
hey, what about the scene with the kangaroo? did you like that part?:::['8-22-155']
i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic.:::['8-22-156']
you fell asleep!:::['8-22-157']
there was no kangaroo! they didn't take any of my suggestions!:::['8-22-158']
thanks for coming. see you later. don't go. i'm so sorry.:::['8-22-159']
look, this guy fell asleep! he fell asleep too! be mad at him!:::['8-22-160']
or call an ambulance!:::['8-22-161']
what did the doctor say? any news on when the baby will come?:::['8-22-163']
no. she gave us ideas on how to induce labor.:::['8-22-164']
we tried them all.:::['8-22-165']
we went for a walk, uh, we tried tea, castor oil, spicy food. nothing worked.:::['8-22-166']
there is one thing we didn't try.:::['8-22-167']
but someone thinks that that will open up a can of worms.:::['8-22-168']
if it's gonna help bring the baby here, today......i think you should do it.:::['8-22-169']
it's sex. do it!:::['8-22-170']
monica. it's been a really long time for you.:::['8-22-171']
i mean, women have needs. do it. get yours.:::['8-22-172']
oh, i don't know about that.:::['8-22-173']
i think if the two of you had sex, the repercussions would be catastrophic.:::['8-22-174']
all right, let's be practical.:::['8-22-175']
if ross isn't willing, he's not the only guy you can have sex with.:::['8-22-176']
you could borrow chandler. chandler is good.:::['8-22-177']
monica, what is the matter with you?:::['8-22-178']
i just want the baby to be born today. why today?:::['8-22-179']
okay, fine.:::['8-22-180', '5-11-286', '4-8-237', '4-2-266']
i bet phoebe that you're gonna have the baby, and i don't want to lose.:::['8-22-181']
what? while she's been going through this hell, you've been making money?:::['8-22-182']
you're betting on your friend staying in this misery?:::['8-22-183']
i'll take that bet. what?:::['8-22-184']
i'm miserable. i may as well make some money out of it.:::['8-22-185']
can i get some of that action?:::['8-22-186']
i'm betting against all of you?:::['8-22-187']
i really feel like tomorrow it's gonna happen.:::['8-22-188']
hey, sleeping beauty.:::['8-22-190']
where have you been? i want to talk to you. i still feel bad.:::['8-22-191']
oh, no. were you upset? did you lose sleep?:::['8-22-192']
the reason i came over is to settle things between us.:::['8-22-194']
i wanted to pay you back with the premiere, but you missed it.:::['8-22-195']
so how much do i owe you? what?:::['8-22-196']
i don't want to owe you anything. you don't owe me.:::['8-22-197']
i don't want your-- ah, ah, ah. we're doing this!:::['8-22-198']
you got me my first headshots. how much?:::['8-22-199']
i don't know, uh, $500. okay, $500. what else?:::['8-22-200']
then there was the second set. the infamous "booger" headshots.:::['8-22-201']
okay, so that's another 500. that's 500 and 500. that's...:::['8-22-202']
you want a calculator? please.:::['8-22-203']
all right, what else?:::['8-22-206']
well, uh, there's acting classes, stage-combat classes, tap classes--:::['8-22-207']
which we're still keeping under our hats.:::['8-22-208']
that dialect coach who helped you with a southern accent.:::['8-22-209']
which, after 20 hours of lessons, still came out jamaican.:::['8-22-210']
what the hell are you talking about? the south will rise again, man.:::['8-22-211']
yes, money well-spent. yeah.:::['8-22-212']

okay, here, have one of these peppers.:::['8-22-220']
oh, god. so hot. oh, my god.:::['8-22-221']
by the way, you don't want to touch the pepper and then touch your eye.:::['8-22-222']
i am feeling nothing. oh...:::['8-22-223']
speaking of hot, watching you do that......really makes me want:::['8-22-224']
to have sex with you.:::['8-22-225']
stop it. come on! why are we wasting time?:::['8-22-226']
we know it's gonna work. it's doctor-recommended.:::['8-22-227']
i'm sorry. but we have to have some boundaries. my god, i'm dying.:::['8-22-228']
we've done it before. we'll do it again.:::['8-22-229']
it'll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy.:::['8-22-230']
i'm not gonna make love to you so you'll go into labor.:::['8-22-231']
make love'? what are you, a girl?:::['8-22-232']
always a great way to get into a man's pants.:::['8-22-233']
you'll be performing a service. think of me as a ketchup bottle.:::['8-22-234']
sometimes, you have to bang on the end of it to get it to come out.:::['8-22-235']
i love when you talk dirty to me.:::['8-22-236']
oh, i know it. you're right. that's not sexy.:::['8-22-237']
oh, oh. whoops.:::['8-22-238']

how on earth will you ever annoy me?:::['8-22-249']
oh, wait a minute, i know.:::['8-22-250']
i you'd think the jalape?o would clear up your sinuses, but no!:::['8-22-251']

yes, i see that here. we can't guarantee a private room.:::['8-23-14']
currently, they're all unavailable. man, if only you'd gotten here sooner.:::['8-23-15']
i'm sorry. semi-private rooms are all we have.:::['8-23-16']
okay. just give us a second. ross?:::['8-23-17']
give her some money. i really think they're out of rooms.:::['8-23-19']
they're saving them for important people! what if i was the president?:::['8-23-20']
we'd be in a lot of trouble. you don't know where any countries are.:::['8-23-21']
say, would you mind checking again?:::['8-23-23']
see if any, uh, private rooms may have opened up?:::['8-23-24']

listen, uh, i've been doing some thinking......and i don't know whether:::['8-23-62']
it's because we're here......or rachel's giving birth......but, um, i think we should:::['8-23-63']
try to have a baby.:::['8-23-64']
what's that now?:::['8-23-66', '9-18-37']
okay. i've been thinking about it too. i think we're ready.:::['8-23-67']

oh, that's very-- really, very, very okay.:::['8-23-79']
julie's cervix is dilated 7 centimeters. that's about four fingers!:::['8-23-80']
doctor let me feel it. have you felt rachel's?:::['8-23-81']
no, i don't-- we won't be doing that.:::['8-23-82']

you can't leave me with them. sorry.:::['8-23-85']

i need to talk to you before the birth. okay. what's up?:::['8-23-89']
i brought something that i want to give you.:::['8-23-90']
assuming, of course, that you want it.:::['8-23-91']
ma, you're asking me to marry you?:::['8-23-92']
your grandma's engagement ring, i want you to give it to rachel.:::['8-23-93']
mom, no. come on. thank you... just hear me out--:::['8-23-94']
no! okay? we're not getting married because she's pregnant.:::['8-23-95']
honestly, this isn't just some girl you picked up in a bar and humped.:::['8-23-96']
a child should have a family.:::['8-23-97']
i can't deal with this now. i'm sorry.:::['8-23-98']
think about it. if you don't, i'll talk more about humping.:::['8-23-99']
hi, dear. hi. thank you so much for coming.:::['8-23-101']
ross, get in here!:::['8-23-102']
she dragged me out of the labor room to ask me why i'm not with rachel.:::['8-23-103']
why aren't you with rachel? are you kidding?:::['8-23-105']
we're not gonna be together because we're having a baby.:::['8-23-106']
it seems you belong together.:::['8-23-107']
i can't deal with this right now. i have to go have a baby.:::['8-23-108']
right. and with who again?:::['8-23-109']
he's crazy. why doesn't he wanna be with rachel?:::['8-23-110']
she's like the perfect woman. i know she turned me down......but if she wanted to be with me,i would take her in my arms and...:::['8-23-112']
i haven't bummed you guys out like this in a while.:::['8-23-113']
ross: hey. rachel: hey.:::['8-23-114']
who's that? new people.:::['8-23-115']
what happened to the disgustingtons?:::['8-23-116']
they're having their baby. it's not fair, ross. i got here first!:::['8-23-117']
after you left, they wheeled her off.:::['8-23-118']
not before she gave me a nice, juicy shot of little jamie, crowning away.:::['8-23-119']
wow. sorry. ugh.:::['8-23-120']
so, uh, how are the new people?:::['8-23-121']
well, they have some unusual pet names for each other.:::['8-23-122']
including, um, "evil bitch" and, uh, "sick bastard.":::['8-23-123']
oh, gosh, a contraction. ooh, ow! yeah? okay, okay. just breathe.:::['8-23-124']
woman: are you looking at her? no!:::['8-23-125']
don't look at her, you sick bastard! i swear i wasn't looking at her!:::['8-23-126']
she's in labor. you like that, you sick son of a bitch?:::['8-23-127']
i'm just gonna--:::['8-23-128']
see? it's because you were looking, you fat pervert.:::['8-23-129']
no, no. i'm sure no one was looking. just want some privacy.:::['8-23-130']
woman: you miss your girlfriend?:::['8-23-131']
just ignore them. ugh.:::['8-23-132']
you okay? yeah.:::['8-23-133', '7-22-259', '10-13-126']
ross. what?:::['8-23-134']

wanna live to see your baby?:::['8-23-136']
don't you talk to my husband like that, you stupid bastard!:::['8-23-137']
oh, good god! if you want a baby so bad, just go steal it!:::['8-23-138']
since when are you so crazy about babies?:::['8-23-139']
i'm not crazy about babies. i'm crazy about us.:::['8-23-140']
we talk about having babies someday, not now......but i'm starting to think that we:::['8-23-142']
can handle it. we're good.:::['8-23-143']
we're really good.:::['8-23-144']
we are pretty good.:::['8-23-145']
but nothing has to happen until you're ready.:::['8-23-146']
well, maybe i'm ready now.:::['8-23-147']
i mean, it's a little scary, but maybe it's right.:::['8-23-148']
it's not right! we're not ready for a kid!:::['8-23-149']
what? i'm kidding. this is gonna be fun.:::['8-23-150']
so we're gonna try? i mean, we're trying?:::['8-23-151']
we're trying to get pregnant.:::['8-23-152']
chandler: mm.:::['8-23-153', '10-10-352', '5-19-72']
i'm not comfortable doing this in front of the babies.:::['8-23-154']
so when do you want to start trying? all right, hold on a sec.:::['8-23-155']

i'm dilated......have come and gone with their babies.:::['8-23-262']
i'm next. my turn. it's only fair.:::['8-23-263']
if you bring in one more woman who has her baby before me, i will sue you.:::['8-23-264']
not this hospital. i'm gonna sue you. my husband is a lawyer.:::['8-23-265']
uh, rach? you get back on that case, honey!:::['8-23-266']
i don't think the next patient is far along.:::['8-23-267']
okay. well, then bring her in.:::['8-23-268']
qh, my god!:::['8-23-269', '9-20-127', '9-20-260', '9-15-287', '10-17-5', '10-17-195']
i can't believe this!:::['8-23-270', '7-12-68', '2-12-91', '5-13-330']
and yet, somehow, it's true.:::['8-23-271']
i mean, this is so great. we're gonna be baby buddies!:::['8-23-272']
squeeze your legs together, cover the baby's ears.:::['8-23-273']
hi, sweetie! hi, sweetheart.:::['8-23-274']
this is my husband, sid. i don't think you've met. ross, rachel, this is sid.:::['8-23-275']
i nabbed him at the dermatologist's. thank god for adult acne!:::['8-23-276']
i can't believe it. i'm the luckiest guy in the world.:::['8-23-277']
what did he say?:::['8-23-279']
you have to speak loudly, he's almost completely deaf.:::['8-23-280']
oh, there you go. of course he is.:::['8-23-281']
congratulations. i didn't even know you got married.:::['8-23-282']
oh, no. we didn't. no, no, we-- what?:::['8-23-283']
we're just having this baby together, but, uh, that's all. you know?:::['8-23-284']
uh, we're just not in that place, you know? but we're very excited about this.:::['8-23-286']
oh. well, then shut me up.:::['8-23-287']
just tell me how.:::['8-23-288']
uh-oh. oh, i feel another one coming.:::['8-23-289']
heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh!:::['8-23-290']
hey, rach, listen. did you know that during pregnancy......your fingers swell up to twice:::['8-9-0']
their size and never go back?:::['8-9-1']
oh, my god. let me see that.:::['8-9-2']
you fall for it every time.:::['8-9-3']
hey. look, i brought you my old maternity clothes.:::['8-9-4']
oh, pheebs, that's so sweet. oh, those are so cute.:::['8-9-5']
and look. see how they expand as the baby grows?:::['8-9-6']
and then after the baby's born, they're great for shoplifting melons.:::['8-9-7']
oh, good, you're all here. okay, thanksgiving tomorrow, 4:00.:::['8-9-8']
oh. and guess who i invited? remember that guy will culvert from high school?:::['8-9-9']
no. he was in ross' class.:::['8-9-10']
marching band, was kind of overweight. well, really overweight.:::['8-9-11']
i mean, i was his thin friend.:::['8-9-12']
wow, i don't remember him. are you sure you're not talking about your imaginary boyfriend?:::['8-9-13']
no, that was jared.:::['8-9-14']
wow. haven't thought about him in a long time.:::['8-9-15']
anyway, um, will's here on business... ...and he didn't have a place to go so i invited him here.:::['8-9-16']
oh, that's nice. oh, by the way, he's lost a bunch of weight. i mean, he looks good. okay, i mean really, really gorgeous.:::['8-9-17']
i still love chandler. wouldn't hurt you to say it once in a while.:::['8-9-18']
okay, also, just so you know, i'm not gonna make a turkey this year.:::['8-9-19']
what? well, phoebe doesn't eat turkey.:::['8-9-20']
phoebe. turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.:::['8-9-21']
no, they're not. they're ugly and stupid and delicious.:::['8-9-22']
all right, it's not just phoebe. will's still on a diet... ...chandler doesn't eat thanksgiving food......and rachel's having:::['8-9-23']
her aversion to poultry.:::['8-9-24']
she is?:::['8-9-25']
yeah, remember i had to leave the other day when you had that chicken?:::['8-9-26']
i thought that was just because i put the whole thing on my hand......and made it walk across the table.:::['8-9-27']
it just doesn't seem worth it to make a whole turkey for three people. it's a lot of work.:::['8-9-28']
but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving.:::['8-9-29']
i mean, thanksgiving with no turkey is like fourth of july with no apple pie.:::['8-9-30']
or friday with no two pizzas.:::['8-9-31']
all right, fine, if it means that much to you, but there's gonna be a ton left over.:::['8-9-32']
no, there won't. i promise i will finish that turkey.:::['8-9-33']
all right, you're telling me you can eat almost an entire turkey in one sitting?:::['8-9-34']
that's right. because i'm a tribbiani. this is what we do.:::['8-9-35']
we may not be great thinkers or world leaders.:::['8-9-36']
we don't read a lot or run very fast, but damn it, we can eat.:::['8-9-37']
four wide receivers. on third and 18.:::['8-9-38']
hey, isn't it weird to think about how next year at this time... ...there'll be a little baby at the table?:::['8-9-39']
rachel's. but good to know where you're at.:::['8-9-40']
happy thanksgiving. you too.:::['8-9-42']
anything i can do to help? actually, there is.:::['8-9-43']
chandler usually helps but he's into the game so i don't wanna bother him.:::['8-9-44']
could you help me fold these napkins? sure. i'm gonna go across the hall to check on the yams.:::['8-9-45']
okay. no, no, no, sweetie. no, not like that.:::['8-9-46']
we're not at a barn dance.:::['8-9-47']
you wanna fold them like swans. like i showed you at christmas, remember?:::['8-9-48']
yeah, it all just came screaming back to me.:::['8-9-49']
so how's the game? i have no idea.:::['8-9-50']
yeah, i'm just pretending to watch the game so i don't have to help out with stuff.:::['8-9-52']
i don't believe you. that is brilliant.:::['8-9-53']
and monica has no idea? nope.:::['8-9-54']
every once in a while i just yell and scream stuff at the tv.:::['8-9-55']
hey, what...? hey!:::['8-9-56']
is your team winning, hon? oh, yeah. anderson just scored again.:::['8-9-57']
there's no anderson.:::['8-9-58']
oh, i wanna get in on this. hey, mon?:::['8-9-59']
i don't think i can't help you after all. i didn't realize this game was on.:::['8-9-60']
oh. i didn't know you liked football. well, normally, i don't.:::['8-9-61']
but, you know, green bay is playing.:::['8-9-62']
you like green bay? well, it's only like my favorite bay.:::['8-9-63']
happy thanksgiving. aw, thanks.:::['8-9-65']
god, will, i'm so glad that you came. you just... you look great. you must've lost like...:::['8-9-66']
a hundred and fifty pounds. yeah, i'm gonna be in one of those subway sandwich commercials.:::['8-9-67']
a pie. right. uh, it's no fat, no sugar, no dairy.:::['8-9-68']
it's no good. throw it out. you wanna meet some people?:::['8-9-69']
this is, uh, my husband, chandler. chandler, this is will.:::['8-9-70']
oh, hey. i'd shake your hand but, uh, i'm really into the game.:::['8-9-71']
plus, i think it'd be better for my ego if we didn't stand right next to each other.:::['8-9-72']
this is phoebe. hi.:::['8-9-73']
hey. wow.:::['8-9-74']
well done.:::['8-9-75']
wanna give me a hand? sure. monica, i can't get over how great you look. you look stunning.:::['8-9-76']
you look incredible too. you're just so fit. i'm watching the game but i'm not deaf.:::['8-9-77']
oh, um, i meant to tell you, ross is coming. ross is coming. great, i love ross.:::['8-9-78']
well, good. and rachel green too.:::['8-9-79']
is there a problem? nope. uh, it's okay.:::['8-9-81']
it's just, uh... god, i hated her.:::['8-9-82']
what? i hated her.:::['8-9-83']
she was horrible to me in high school.:::['8-9-84']
but hey, that was a long time ago. i'm in a good place. it might be actually fun to see her again.:::['8-9-85']
got any cakes or cookies or something?:::['8-9-86']
no, will. no.:::['8-9-87']
you know, it's been a while since we screamed something. maybe we should.:::['8-9-88']
oh, okay. no! oh, come on!:::['8-9-89']
damn you, ref. you burn in hell!:::['8-9-90']
hey, what are you doing? you gotta save room. you've got almost an entire turkey to eat.:::['8-9-91']
let me explain to you how the human body works.:::['8-9-92']
i have to warm up my stomach first.:::['8-9-93']
eating chips is like stretching. okay.:::['8-9-94']
don't worry, tribbianis never get full. i actually know what you're talking about. and i'm here to tell you something.:::['8-9-95']
you can eat and eat and eat, but nothing will ever fill that void.:::['8-9-96']
who the hell is this guy? this is will, from high school. oh, hey. hello.:::['8-9-97']
will. will: ross.:::['8-9-98']
hey, you came. man, you look incredible. hot stuff.:::['8-9-99']
hot stuff? it's good to see you, man.:::['8-9-100']
yeah, you too. man, so, what are you up to?:::['8-9-101']
i'm a commodities broker. really? that sounds interesting.:::['8-9-102']
yeah, it's not. oh.:::['8-9-103']
but i'm rich and thin. oh, hey.:::['8-9-104']
man, i don't think i've seen you since, uh, lance davis' graduation party.:::['8-9-105']
that was such a fun night. yeah.:::['8-9-106']
would've been good if we had gotten in, but still, real fun.:::['8-9-107']
god, we were lame back then. do you remember how into dinosaurs we were?:::['8-9-108']
yeah. so, what do you do now?:::['8-9-109']
so how long are you in town?:::['8-9-110']
hi. monica: hey, sweetie. oh, good.:::['8-9-111']
rachel green.:::['8-9-112', '4-2-39']
oh, oh, that's right. are you gonna be okay?:::['8-9-113']
oh, i'll be fine. it's just... god, i hate her, ross. i hate her.:::['8-9-114']
will, high school was a long time ago.:::['8-9-115']
look at her standing there with those yams.:::['8-9-116']
my two greatest enemies, ross: rachel green and complex carbohydrates.:::['8-9-117']
oh, my god, monica. who is that?:::['8-9-118']
that's will, from high school. ah. i do not remember him.:::['8-9-119']
wow, really got that sexy smoldering thing going on.:::['8-9-120']
oh, my god. look at the way he's just staring at me.:::['8-9-121']
i think he's trying to mouth something to me, but i can't make it out.:::['8-9-122']
i hate you.:::['8-9-123']
okay, dinner's ready. okay.:::['8-9-124']
yeah. solid effort. solid effort. oh, so who won?:::['8-9-125']
green bay. detroit.:::['8-9-126']
what? well, the lions technically won.:::['8-9-127']
but it was a moral victory for the green bay mermen.:::['8-9-128']
hi. will, right? right. right, hi. i'm rachel green.:::['8-9-129']
oh, i remember you. really? aren't you sweet?:::['8-9-130']
i gotta tell you though, i'm having the hardest time placing you.:::['8-9-131']
oh, oh, hang on. i think i remember you.:::['8-9-132']
did we, um...? did we fool around at lance davis' graduation party?:::['8-9-133']
you are unbelievable. thank you.:::['8-9-134']
uh, rachel? why don't you sit here? and, will, you sit way over there.:::['8-9-135']
that's it? even if nobody helps me, i can eat that, no problem.:::['8-9-136']
at least give me a challenge.:::['8-9-137']
this is chandler's chicken.:::['8-9-138']
this is the turkey.:::['8-9-139']
oh. how big is that?:::['8-9-140']
about 19 pounds. it's like me when i was born.:::['8-9-141']
all right, who would, uh, like some yams? will? oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?:::['8-9-142']
what? oh, you know what? can we please keep the chicken......and the turkey and everything:::['8-9-143']
on the other side?:::['8-9-144']
the smell is just... yuck. typical. ahem.:::['8-9-145']
i'm sorry, what? i said it was typical.:::['8-9-146']
typical of you, rachel green. queen rachel, does whatever she wants in her little rachel-land.:::['8-9-147']
seriously, who is this guy?:::['8-9-148']
um, ahem, sorry, do you have a problem with me?:::['8-9-149']
i don't know. do i? do i? i think you do.:::['8-9-150']
apparently you were a little mean to him in high school.:::['8-9-151']
a little mean? you made my life miserable. i had no idea. i'm sorry.:::['8-9-152']
well, you should be. screw it. bring on the yams.:::['8-9-153']
will, but you've worked so hard.:::['8-9-154']
yams! okay.:::['8-9-155']
uh, will, i just wanna say that i'm real sorry for whatever i did to you in high school.:::['8-9-156']
oh, it wasn't just me. we had a club.:::['8-9-157']
you had a club? that's right. the "i hate rachel green club.":::['8-9-158']
oh, my god. so, what, you all just joined together to hate me?:::['8-9-159']
who else was in this club? me and ross.:::['8-9-160']
no need to point. she knows who ross is.:::['8-9-161']
so you were in an "i hate rachel" club? yes, he was.:::['8-9-162']
so who else was in this club? uh, actually, there was also that exchange student from thailand.:::['8-9-164']
but i don't think he knew what it was.:::['8-9-165']
so, ross, we went out for two years and you never told me......you were in an "i hate rachel club.":::['8-9-166']
you went out with her? we had a pact.:::['8-9-167']
it was in high school. it's not like it was binding forever. then why did it have the word "eternity" in it?:::['8-9-168']
okay, monica, did you know about this?:::['8-9-169']
i swear i didn't. hey, is that why you guys... ...used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door?:::['8-9-170']
both: yeah. huh. a little relieved, i gotta say.:::['8-9-171']
look, rach, i'm sorry, okay? i was a stupid kid, okay?:::['8-9-172']
the only reason i joined...:::['8-9-173']
cofounded. cofounded.:::['8-9-174']
cofounded the club, was that i was insanely in love with you.:::['8-9-175']
obviously i didn't handle it very well... ...but if you think about it, the "i hate rachel club"......was really the "i love rachel club.":::['8-9-176']
uh, except that it was really the "i hate rachel club.":::['8-9-177']
okay, so, what, you guys would just get together and say mean things about me?:::['8-9-178']
well, we did a little more than that. no, no. no, no. no, no. heh.:::['8-9-179']
what? what else did you do?:::['8-9-180']
we started a rumor. what rumor?:::['8-9-181']
oh, come on, will. just take off your shirt and tell us.:::['8-9-182']
ross? ugh, it was no big deal.:::['8-9-183']
uh, we... we said that... the rumor was that, um......you had both male and female:::['8-9-184']
reproductive parts.:::['8-9-185']
what? that's right.:::['8-9-187', '7-20-149']
we said your parents flipped a coin... ...decided to raise you as a girl, but you still had a hint of a penis.:::['8-9-188']
oh, my god. you started that?:::['8-9-189']
what, you heard that? everyone at our school heard it.:::['8-9-190']
everybody at my school heard it. you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader?:::['8-9-191']
oh, my god, this is all making so much sense to me now. this is why adam carter wouldn't go out with me.:::['8-9-193']
this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region.:::['8-9-194']
actually, billy tratt is gay now, so that one's not really our fault.:::['8-9-195']
monica, how come you never told me this? i thought it might be true.:::['8-9-196']
and i was afraid that you were gonna cry and then show it to me.:::['8-9-197']
joey, stop staring. there's nothing there. it's not true.:::['8-9-198']
i'm afraid i'm gonna need proof. oh...:::['8-9-199']
you are my everest.:::['8-9-200']
joey, you don't have to finish that. oh, yes, i do. otherwise, what's next?:::['8-9-201']
today i'm just a guy who can't finish a turkey... ...but tomorrow i'm the guy who eats half a power bar......wraps up the rest and puts it:::['8-9-202']
in the fridge? no.:::['8-9-203']
i just gotta change my pants. what was i thinking? jeans have no give.:::['8-9-204']
okay. okay. listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year.:::['8-9-205']
"dear rach, you're such a great person." not girl, "person.":::['8-9-206']
rach, i think you're reading a little too much into it.:::['8-9-207']
"dear rach, you're a great person. sorry about your teeny weenie.":::['8-9-208']
what do you want me to do......call everyone in the entire school:::['8-9-209']
and tell them it wasn't true?:::['8-9-210']
yes. could you also tell them i'm skinny now?:::['8-9-211']
oh. me too.:::['8-9-212']
now, look, i'm not calling anybody, okay? it was like a million years ago.:::['8-9-213']
i don't care how long ago it was. you told people that i was half and half.:::['8-9-214']
you know what? i just wanna point out... ...i never did anything to hurt you in high school.:::['8-9-215']
that's not totally true.:::['8-9-216']
well, you did start that rumor about ross......making out with mrs. altmann,our 50-year-old librarian.:::['8-9-218']
how did you know that?:::['8-9-219']
it's true? no.:::['8-9-220']
yes, it is. i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog.:::['8-9-221']
mrs. altmann? she also made out......with ta-taka-ki-kek the night:::['8-9-222']
before he went back to thailand.:::['8-9-223']
i'm sorry, when you were in high school you made out with a 50-year-old woman?:::['8-9-224']
hey, she didn't look 50. did she look 16?:::['8-9-225']
oh, there's a picture of her in the yearbook actually.:::['8-9-226']
wow. she didn't photograph well.:::['8-9-228']
she probably wasn't familiar with the process......having spent most of her life:::['8-9-229']
sitting for oil paintings.:::['8-9-230']
so how did this happen? did she lure you to an early-bird dinner?:::['8-9-231']
i was working late in the library one afternoon. it was just the two of us.:::['8-9-232']
she needed some help with her word jumble.:::['8-9-233']
and one thing led to another.:::['8-9-234']
if you must know, anita was very gentle and tender.:::['8-9-235']
may she rest in peace.:::['8-9-236']
didn't she walk with a cane? only when it was damp.:::['8-9-237']
i can't believe you told people about this. everybody knew?:::['8-9-238']
you know what? i'm back in the club. yeah!:::['8-9-239']
i wanna join. what...? phoebe?:::['8-9-240']
i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i never got to be in a club. i didn't go to high school.:::['8-9-241']
but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french.:::['8-9-242']
all right, you know, fine, you guys can have your stupid little club.:::['8-9-243']
but i would just like to say what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you.:::['8-9-244']
you gave me a teeny weenie. ha, ha, yeah.:::['8-9-245']
all right, listen. you're just being silly.:::['8-9-246']
rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school. everyone wanted to be like you.:::['8-9-247']
one girl wanted to be like you so much, she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll.:::['8-9-248']
and, ross, if it weren't for rachel's rumor... ...i mean, no one in high school would have even known who you were.:::['8-9-250']
she put you on the map. as a romancer of the elderly.:::['8-9-251']
hey, mrs. altmann was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty.:::['8-9-252']
the eyes did still sparkle.:::['8-9-253']
hey, guys, this stuff is so way in the past. you've been through so much since then.:::['8-9-254']
and right now, you got so much more important stuff going on in your lives.:::['8-9-255']
can't you just let this go?:::['8-9-256']
she's right. yeah, i mean, we are having a baby together.:::['8-9-257']
hold on.:::['8-9-258', '10-14-352', '5-15-8']
you got her pregnant? yeah.:::['8-9-259']
are you getting married? no.:::['8-9-260']
so you knocked her up but you're not gonna marry her.:::['8-9-261']
dude.:::['8-9-262', '9-15-51', '7-24-217', '5-14-311', '4-13-11']
anybody? okay.:::['8-9-263']
it's exactly how i imagined it would be.:::['8-9-264']
all right, where's that turkey?:::['8-9-265']
joey, those are my maternity pants. no, these are my thanksgiving pants.:::['8-9-266']
well, that's it. i'm done.:::['8-9-267']
whew.:::['8-9-268']
here come the meat sweats.:::['8-9-269']
well, joey, we're all very proud of you.:::['8-9-270']
yes, i believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now.:::['8-9-271']
is there anything we can do for you? no, just nobody press on my stomach.:::['8-9-272']
you can keep those pants, by the way.:::['8-9-273']
what...? what do you got there? what is that, pie?:::['8-9-274']
heh. yeah, you want some? just cut me a little sliver.:::['8-9-275']
a little bigger.:::['8-9-276']
little bigger.:::['8-9-277']
what, are you afraid you're gonna run out? cut me a real piece.:::['8-9-278']
hey, pheebs, i'm having dinner with my dad tomorrow. wanna come?:::['8-8-0']
sure, yeah, he's kind of sexy.:::['8-8-1']
oh, no, i'll be there too.:::['8-8-2']
okay, so we'll just come up with a signal. if it's going well, you can take off.:::['8-8-3']
no, phoebe, i just need you there for support.:::['8-8-4']
i haven't told him i'm pregnant yet. oh. why not?:::['8-8-5']
because i know he's gonna flip out and i hate it when he gets angry.:::['8-8-6']
oh, rachel. this is all so "papa don't preach.":::['8-8-7']
no, pheeb, wait, he's a scary guy. i mean, one time he caught me smoking.:::['8-8-8']
he said if he ever saw me doing that again, he would make me eat the entire pack.:::['8-8-9']
wow. well, i will be there. okay.:::['8-8-10']
gosh, i'm not gonna let that man make you eat your baby.:::['8-8-11']
oh. hey, who is that guy? i think i know him.:::['8-8-12']
no, you don't. no, you don't.:::['8-8-13']
oh, my god. monica, he's the stripper from your bachelorette party.:::['8-8-14']
her what?:::['8-8-15', '3-5-30']
your secret bachelorette party.:::['8-8-16']
you had a bachelorette party? she untied his g-string with her teeth.:::['8-8-17']
somebody stop me.:::['8-8-18']
i thought we weren't gonna have bachelor, bachelorette parties. you know, we agreed that it's a silly tradition.:::['8-8-19']
it's a grand tradition.:::['8-8-20']
i'm sorry. they surprised me. there was nothing i could do.:::['8-8-21']
well, you could have untied it with your hands.:::['8-8-22']
this is so unfair. the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party......but, oh, i wasn't allowed to.:::['8-8-23']
all we got was a stupid steak dinner.:::['8-8-24']
you went home with the waitress.:::['8-8-25']
ha. yeah, that was a good night.:::['8-8-26']
i can't believe you didn't tell me.:::['8-8-27', '2-4-49']
you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty.:::['8-8-28']
ugh. i knew giving you that book was gonna come back and bite me in the ass.:::['8-8-29']
how about i order everyone the moroccan chicken? oh, i don't eat meat.:::['8-8-30']
it's chicken.:::['8-8-31']
yeah, i don't eat that either. i'll never understand you lesbians.:::['8-8-32']
so, baby, tell me, what is new with you? well, actually, um...:::['8-8-33']
ahem. your '74 lafite, sir. seventy-four?:::['8-8-34']
i ordered the '75. that's a magnificent wine. the '74 is sewage.:::['8-8-35']
why would you bring me sewage?:::['8-8-36']
is that a hard question? are you an idiot? is that why you're a waiter?:::['8-8-37']
this is why i told the manager i wouldn't wait on you tonight.:::['8-8-38']
oh, come on. don't be such a baby.:::['8-8-39']
in case you didn't notice, that is a scary man.:::['8-8-40']
he's right, though. the '74 is absolute piss.:::['8-8-41']
this was such a huge mistake. i can't tell him, phoebe. i can't.:::['8-8-42']
rachel... no, it's okay. this is what's gonna happen.:::['8-8-43']
i'm gonna wait a couple of years and then the baby will tell him.:::['8-8-44']
why? so he can get mad at the baby? hey, that is the baby's problem.:::['8-8-45']
oh. everything okay with the waiter? i have no idea. i went to the bathroom.:::['8-8-46']
so, sweetie, you were starting to tell me what is, uh...? what is new with you?:::['8-8-47']
rachel: well...:::['8-8-48']
i got tivo.:::['8-8-50']
what's tivo? it's slang for "pregnant.":::['8-8-51']
are you really pregnant?:::['8-8-53']
well, uh, yes and no.:::['8-8-54']
except, not no.:::['8-8-55']
so to sum it up, yeah.:::['8-8-56']
who is the father? oh, no. please don't tell me it's her.:::['8-8-57']
no, it's ross. it's ross. you like ross.:::['8-8-58']
oh, daddy, i hope you're okay with all this.:::['8-8-59']
i mean, think about it, this is a good thing. this is your first grandchild.:::['8-8-60']
you're gonna be a poppy.:::['8-8-61']
that's true. i'm a poppy.:::['8-8-62']
i'm gonna be a poppy.:::['8-8-63']
so when is the wedding? the who?:::['8-8-64']
the wedding. there's going to be a wedding.:::['8-8-65']
young lady, don't you sit there and tell me my first grandchild is gonna be a bastard.:::['8-8-66']
rachel karen green, tell me there's gonna be a wedding. february 2nd.:::['8-8-67']
so it was cool seeing you lecture today.:::['8-8-68']
oh, thanks. although it seemed like you were falling asleep there a little.:::['8-8-69']
oh, no, i had my eyes closed so i could concentrate and take it all in.:::['8-8-70']
yeah, a lot of my students do that.:::['8-8-71']
so, um, i gotta get going. okay, i'll see you tonight? yeah. okay.:::['8-8-72']
oh, hey, thanks again for showing me your semi-precious stone collection. it was amazing.:::['8-8-73']
my god, you must be good in bed.:::['8-8-74']
so you and mona. it's been a while now. how's it going?:::['8-8-75']
uh, it's good. it's going good.:::['8-8-76']
i mean, we get along great. she's so...:::['8-8-77']
hot? well, i was gonna say sweet, but yeah.:::['8-8-78']
and she's okay with rachel and the baby?:::['8-8-79']
well, i haven't actually told her yet. i don't wanna scare her off.:::['8-8-80']
well, you have to be honest with her... ...otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path......but you're really:::['8-8-81']
going down different ones.:::['8-8-82']
i'm gonna take that book and i'm gonna beat you to death with it.:::['8-8-83']
oh, my god, you are gonna love me so much.:::['8-8-84']
i felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing, so tonight......you're gonna have a bachelor party.:::['8-8-85']
yeah, i got this number from this guy at work... ...and i hired a stripper to come dance for you.:::['8-8-87']
am i going in the wife hall of fame or what?:::['8-8-88']
honey, that's crazy, i don't you to get me a stripper. will you let the lady talk?:::['8-8-89']
come on. come on, it'll be fun. it'll make me feel so much better.:::['8-8-90']
look, i appreciate it, but, uh, it's a little creepy, you know? i'm not a bachelor anymore.:::['8-8-91']
so don't think of it as a bachelor party. think of it as a two-month anniversary present.:::['8-8-92']
sure. one year is paper, but two months is lap dance.:::['8-8-93']
please, i feel so bad. just watch the hot woman get naked.:::['8-8-94']
fine, but i'm only doing this for you. yeah.:::['8-8-95']
and joey.:::['8-8-96']
thank you. now, who else do you wanna invite? uh, no, no, no. just ross and joey is embarrassing enough.:::['8-8-97']
uh, actually, sorry, i can't even make it. i'm seeing mona again tonight.:::['8-8-98']
i understand. who would cancel an actual date just to go to a fake bachelor party?:::['8-8-99']
i'm sorry. i gotta cancel tonight, baby.:::['8-8-100']
i'm sorry i won't be able to make it to your imaginary wedding... ...but i'm really busy that day.:::['8-8-101']
i already have a unicorn baptism and a leprechaun bar mitzvah.:::['8-8-102']
i know, i know. i panicked. i panicked.:::['8-8-103']
i didn't want him to start yelling at me like i was some '74 latour.:::['8-8-104']
it's lafite.:::['8-8-105']
the '74 latour is actually drinking quite nicely.:::['8-8-106']
all right, here he comes. i'm gonna do this. i'm gonna tell him. i'm gonna be strong.:::['8-8-107']
i just called a friend of mine. yeah.:::['8-8-108']
i think i may be able to book the plaza on short notice.:::['8-8-109']
the plaza?:::['8-8-111']
oh, daddy.:::['8-8-112']
right. daddy, i need to talk to you please. what is it, sweetie?:::['8-8-113']
there's not gonna be a wedding. ross and i are not getting married.:::['8-8-114']
i'm sorry, daddy. i don't believe this.:::['8-8-115']
daddy, stay calm, please. stay calm? how do you expect me to stay calm?:::['8-8-116']
this is unacceptable, rachel. and i wanna know why.:::['8-8-117']
is it because that punk ross won't marry you?:::['8-8-118']
that's it. is that it? yes. he says i'm damaged goods.:::['8-8-119']
so, you, uh, nervous about getting married?:::['8-8-120']
look, let's pretend it's a real bachelor party, okay? you know, before your wedding. it'll be more fun.:::['8-8-122']
all right. i can't believe tomorrow's the big day.:::['8-8-123']
how's it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again, huh?:::['8-8-124']
knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face every day......until you finally have:::['8-8-125']
the sweet release of death.:::['8-8-126']
you're right. this is more fun.:::['8-8-127']
that's her. okay, come on.:::['8-8-128']
so which one of you lucky boys is chandler?:::['8-8-130']
uh, that's me.:::['8-8-131']
joey tribbiani. big fan.:::['8-8-133']
so is that a bedroom? yeah, yeah, right over there.:::['8-8-134']
all right. whenever you're ready.:::['8-8-135']
that was weird.:::['8-8-136']
why would she go in the bedroom? woman: i'm waiting.:::['8-8-137']
so she's a... yep, that's one naked hooker.:::['8-8-138']
i love your place. where is this guy from?:::['8-8-139']
uh, that's an 18th-century indian artifact from calcutta.:::['8-8-140']
so you're more than just dinosaurs.:::['8-8-142']
so much more. mm.:::['8-8-143']
oh, my god. oh, my god, i am so sorry.:::['8-8-144']
ah, forget it. it's from pier 1.:::['8-8-145']
you think you can knock up my daughter and then not marry her?:::['8-8-147']
i ought to kill you.:::['8-8-148']
you know, this is actually not a great time for me.:::['8-8-149']
so come on. explain yourself, geller.:::['8-8-150']
first you get my rachel pregnant... you got rachel pregnant?:::['8-8-151']
who did? you did!:::['8-8-152']
yes. ahem.:::['8-8-153']
yes, yes, i did, but it was just a one-night thing. it meant nothing.:::['8-8-154']
oh? really? that's what my daughter means to you, nothing?:::['8-8-155']
no, no, sir. um, she means a lot to me. i mean, i love rachel.:::['8-8-156']
what? oh, but not in that way. heh.:::['8-8-157']
i mean, i'm not in love with her.:::['8-8-158']
i love her like a friend. oh, really? that's how you treat a friend? you get her in trouble and then you refuse to marry her?:::['8-8-159']
hey, i offered to marry her. what? but i didn't want to.:::['8-8-160']
well, why not? so you could spend your time with this tramp?:::['8-8-161']
tramp?:::['8-8-162']
i'm sorry. dr. green, mona. mona, dr. green.:::['8-8-163']
i can't believe there is a naked hooker in there.:::['8-8-164']
wait, wait. maybe she's a hooker and a stripper......but she got confused:::['8-8-165']
about what she's supposed to do.:::['8-8-166']
could be. i mean, technically, she did strip. we just missed it.:::['8-8-167']
ma'am?:::['8-8-168']
are you also a stripper?:::['8-8-169']
woman: uh, no, but i could pretend to strip. but that's gonna cost extra.:::['8-8-170']
okay, here's the extras: handcuffs, spanking...:::['8-8-171']
no, no, ha, ha.:::['8-8-172']
maybe monica's playing a joke on you.:::['8-8-173']
you know, getting her own husband a hooker. that's pretty funny.:::['8-8-174']
that is funny. maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.:::['8-8-175']
i bet ross was in on it too. i mean, he was conveniently busy.:::['8-8-176']
woman: do you mind if i smoke in here? oh, actually, i'd rather... ahem.:::['8-8-177']
yeah, go ahead. we're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.:::['8-8-178']
how could you have kept all of this from me? i was going to tell you, but... but what?:::['8-8-179']
you figured you'd get what you wanted, then you'd dump her like rachel.:::['8-8-180']
hey, i did not dump rachel. nor are we still together.:::['8-8-181']
can i...?:::['8-8-183']
why don't we just let the machine get that?:::['8-8-184']
there's a hooker over here.:::['8-8-185']
we thought maybe you'd know something about it.:::['8-8-186']
no. no. no. no. no.:::['8-8-187']
i need to lie down.:::['8-8-188']
so tonight's the night of the big bachelor party?:::['8-8-189']
yeah, hey, thanks for giving me that girl's number.:::['8-8-190']
no problem. so who's the party for?:::['8-8-191']
my husband. you hired your husband a hooker?:::['8-8-192']
she's a stripper. no, she's a hooker.:::['8-8-193']
is that what they call strippers sometimes? when they're hookers.:::['8-8-194']
oh, my god, stu, i can't believe you did this.:::['8-8-195']
you're absolutely sure she's a hooker?:::['8-8-196']
either that, or she's just the best, most expensive date i ever had.:::['8-8-197']
maybe she meant to get you a hooker. why would she do that?:::['8-8-198']
maybe she wants you to learn something.:::['8-8-199']
is there anything you're really bad at, you know, sexually?:::['8-8-200']
this is the worst bachelor party ever.:::['8-8-201']
woman: what's taking you boys so long? in a minute.:::['8-8-202']
in a minute? what's gonna happen in a minute?:::['8-8-203']
all right, all right. maybe you should just ask her to leave.:::['8-8-204']
why me? hey, it's your bachelor party.:::['8-8-205']
which is why you should do it. i don't want to. you do it.:::['8-8-206']
you do it. you do it.:::['8-8-207']
all right, rock, paper, scissors for who has to tell the whore to leave.:::['8-8-208']
what? i miss this.:::['8-8-209']
i don't think we've actually done this before.:::['8-8-210']
no, i miss hanging out with you.:::['8-8-211']
well, we still hang out. not like we used to.:::['8-8-212']
remember? you and me used to be inseparable.:::['8-8-213']
well, now it's like things are different.:::['8-8-214']
well, you know, things are different. i'm married now.:::['8-8-215']
yeah, sure. and, hey, don't get me wrong, i am so happy for you guys.:::['8-8-216']
but i just miss hanging out. just us, you know?:::['8-8-217']
yeah, i miss that too.:::['8-8-218']
i'll tell you what, from now on, we'll make time to hang out with each other.:::['8-8-219']
you got it. come here.:::['8-8-220']
listen, i am this close to robbing you guys.:::['8-8-222']
she's a hooker! she's a hooker! she's a...!:::['8-8-223']
hi. uh, we spoke on the phone.:::['8-8-224']
so your dad dropped by.:::['8-8-225']
he's a pleasant man.:::['8-8-226']
oh, no. phoebe: i better go.:::['8-8-227']
just over here. i don't wanna miss the fight.:::['8-8-228']
ross, i am so sorry.:::['8-8-229']
okay, i promise i will straighten this out with him tomorrow in person.:::['8-8-230']
or via e-mail.:::['8-8-231']
i don't care about your dad. i care about mona. she was there and now she's totally freaked out.:::['8-8-232']
ugh, okay, i'll fix that too. what's her e-mail address?:::['8-8-233']
all right, i promise, i'll fix this. i swear i'll talk to her.:::['8-8-235']
okay. thank you. okay.:::['8-8-236']
that's it? you call that a fight? come on.:::['8-8-237']
"we were on a break." "no we weren't." what happened to you two?:::['8-8-238']
thank you so much for coming back over.:::['8-8-239']
oh, good. you're here.:::['8-8-240']
yeah, and i was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable.:::['8-8-241']
i know. mona, just hear me out.:::['8-8-242']
first of all, i am so sorry about my father yelling at you.:::['8-8-243']
but i heard that you totally held your own. you're gonna have to tell me how you did that.:::['8-8-244']
focus. okay. um...:::['8-8-245']
okay, yes, ross and i used to date.:::['8-8-246']
and yes, we are gonna have a baby.:::['8-8-247']
but we are definitely not getting back together.:::['8-8-248']
how can i be sure of that? oh, because we drove each other crazy.:::['8-8-249']
i mean, he was possessive, he was jealous. he could never just let the little things go.:::['8-8-250']
trying to date this woman. right.:::['8-8-251']
but none of that compared to how kind and gentle......and thoughtful he is.:::['8-8-252']
you probably shouldn't touch me.:::['8-8-253']
you know, i just don't wanna get in the middle of something so complicated.:::['8-8-254']
i get it. but, mona, what relationship is not complicated?:::['8-8-255']
we all have our baggage. you must too.:::['8-8-256']
why else would you still be single?:::['8-8-257']
i'm so gonna leave right now.:::['8-8-258']
should i leave this open for you too?:::['8-8-259']
i'm not sure yet. why didn't you just tell me about all this?:::['8-8-260']
because what's going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you.:::['8-8-261']
well, you still should have told me. i know, and i was going to......but i thought it was better:::['8-8-262']
that you heard it from rachel's father.:::['8-8-263']
look, i made a mistake......but it's only because:::['8-8-264']
i really, really like you. really.:::['8-8-265']
okay. i guess you can close the door now.:::['8-8-266']
forgot my purse. oh, you guys made up.:::['8-8-267']
he's a good kisser, isn't he? i'm going.:::['8-8-268']
i swear i didn't know she was a hooker. i mean...:::['8-8-269']
did you let her smoke in here?:::['8-8-270']
her ass-print is still on your grandmother's quilt. do you really want to talk about smoking?:::['8-8-271']
you know what? i'm gonna make this up to you.:::['8-8-272']
i promised you a stripper...:::['8-8-273']
...and you're gonna get a stripper.:::['8-8-275']
monica, wait. what?:::['8-8-276']
carry on.:::['8-8-277', '2-6-180']
if i had to give you up it's only been a year:::['8-8-278']
now, i got my foot through the door and i ain't going nowhere:::['8-8-279']
it took a while to get me in and i'm gonna take my time:::['8-8-280']
ooh. these tennis shoes are so tight.:::['8-8-281']
i think i'll take them off. could you not narrate?:::['8-8-282']
gotcha, sailor.:::['8-8-283']
you're not in love with the guy...:::['8-8-284']
speaking indistinctly]:::['8-8-285', '7-13-154']
oh, you told your dad the truth. about an hour ago.:::['8-8-286']
wanna go see a movie? yes.:::['8-8-287']
bye, dad.:::['8-8-288']
green: it's unacceptable, rachel. what the hell does love have to do with it?:::['8-8-289']
there are more important things in a marriage than love.:::['8-8-290']
you have to think about the consequences of your decisions.:::['8-8-291']
hey, i do too think about the consequences of my decisions.:::['8-8-292']
well, what gives you the right to...?:::['8-8-293']
go to hell.:::['8-8-294']
stupid guy on my phone.:::['8-8-295']
god, you're beautiful.:::['9-19-0']
why are we fighting this?:::['9-19-1']
you know you want it to happen as much as i do.:::['9-19-2']
i want you. i need you.:::['9-19-3']
let me make love to you.:::['9-19-4']
i don't wanna stand in the way of, uh, true love or anything......but i think a cantaloupe:::['9-19-5']
might hurt less.:::['9-19-6']
no, i'm, uh, rehearsing my lines.:::['9-19-7']
they're giving me a romantic story on days of our lives.:::['9-19-8']
it's the first time my character's got one. i'm nervous. i want it to be good.:::['9-19-9']
wow, i haven't seen you this worked-up since you did that dog-food commercial......and you thought you were gonna be:::['9-19-10']
with a real talking dog.:::['9-19-11']
yeah, that was a disappointment.:::['9-19-12']
ooh, hey, you wanna, uh, come down to the set and tell me if i'm doing okay?:::['9-19-13']
are you serious? yeah.:::['9-19-14', '3-3-160']
you just have to promise not to get thrown out again.:::['9-19-15']
that was an honest mistake. right.:::['9-19-16']
"oh, my god. is this the men's room? i feel so foolish.:::['9-19-17']
have you always known you wanted to be an actor?":::['9-19-18']
yeah, that was an awesome day.:::['9-19-19']
hey! ross & phoebe: hey.:::['9-19-20']
you guys wanna come eat dinner at the restaurant in the next few weeks?:::['9-19-21']
sure! i'd love to. well, you can't.:::['9-19-22']
we're booked solid for the next month. well, i can't give you a massage......because my license:::['9-19-23']
has been revoked again.:::['9-19-24']
phoebe, what happened? well, it was an accident, you know.:::['9-19-25']
it's a lot of oil and sometimes the hand just slips.:::['9-19-26']
have i got a surprise for you. pack your bags.:::['9-19-27']
oh, no. you guys aren't supposed to get divorced for seven years.:::['9-19-28']
what? no, i'm taking monica to a romantic inn in vermont.:::['9-19-29']
oh, good. okay, good for you. trying to recapture the magic.:::['9-19-30']
so can you get out of work? honey, i can't.:::['9-19-31']
things are crazy at the restaurant. you're really that busy?:::['9-19-32']
yeah. i'm sorry, i really am.:::['9-19-33']
chandler: that's okay. i'll just, uh, try and reschedule.:::['9-19-34']
hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there......and i need to change it.:::['9-19-35']
what do you mean it's nonrefundable? well, can i just come some other time?:::['9-19-36']
can't you make an exception?:::['9-19-37']
tell them i'm a chef at a big new york restaurant.:::['9-19-38']
tell them that in two weeks, i will once again be a masseuse in good standing.:::['9-19-39']
look, this is ridiculous. i'm not paying for that room, okay?:::['9-19-40']
well, thank you very much.:::['9-19-41']
yeah, i'm going to vermont.:::['9-19-42']
don't worry, use your travel insurance. i don't have travel insurance.:::['9-19-43']
well, this is what happens when people live on the edge.:::['9-19-44']
why don't you take ross?:::['9-19-45']
heh. don't you think that'll be a little weird? i mean, two guys in a romantic inn?:::['9-19-46']
no, not if the room has two beds. i guess.:::['9-19-47']
it still seems a little-- "moonlight boat ride"?:::['9-19-48']
joey, is this the bed where olivia lost her virginity?:::['9-19-49']
i don't know, but one of the extras sure did.:::['9-19-50']
listen, rach. thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes.:::['9-19-51']
please, honey. just the fact that you want me here to support you, i'm--:::['9-19-52']
oh, my god. is that christian saunders? he is so gorgeous!:::['9-19-53']
and also, so gay.:::['9-19-54']
well, in my head, he's done some pretty not-gay stuff.:::['9-19-55']
well, at the christmas party, him and santa did some definitely-gay stuff.:::['9-19-56']
joey? joey, we're ready for you.:::['9-19-57']
rachel: oh. ahem. joey: okay. all right, wish me luck.:::['9-19-58']
okay. not that you need it, but good-- god! is that chase lassiter?:::['9-19-59']
he's straight, right? rash, if you weren't here wondering......if these guys were gay,i don't know if i could do this.:::['9-19-60']
i'm sorry, you're right. i'm sorry. good luck. man: on a bell, please.:::['9-19-61']
quietly.:::['9-19-62']
olma: drake, what are you doing here?:::['9-19-65']
stopping you from marrying the wrong man......and making the biggest:::['9-19-66']
mistake of your life.:::['9-19-67']
get out. you don't love him.:::['9-19-68']
what do you know about love?:::['9-19-69']
i know what i felt that night when we kissed under the bridge.:::['9-19-70']
olma: that kiss never happened. well, what about this one?:::['9-19-71']
olma: now, i told you to get out.:::['9-19-72']
fine, i'll go.:::['9-19-73']
but let me ask you one question.:::['9-19-74']
you look real familiar. have we--? shh! he's asking her a question.:::['9-19-75']
can you live the rest of your life never knowing what we could have been?:::['9-19-76']
i don't have a choice. yes, you do.:::['9-19-77']
yes, you do. i'm the one who doesn't have a choice because i...:::['9-19-78']
because i can't stop loving you.:::['9-19-79']
olma: don't say that.:::['9-19-80']
just":::['9-19-81']
...tell me to stop.:::['9-19-82']
man: cut! no!:::['9-19-83']
or, cut. you know, that's your call.:::['9-19-84']
everything was delicious. thank you.:::['9-19-85']
it was. the duck in particular was superb.:::['9-19-86']
you haven't said anything.:::['9-19-88']
actually, i do have one small complaint.:::['9-19-89']
oh, well, please, i welcome criticism.:::['9-19-90']
the musician right outside the restaurant is kind of a mood killer.:::['9-19-91']
what musician?:::['9-19-92']
and there's a country called argentina:::['9-19-93']
it's a place i've never seen:::['9-19-94']
but i'm told for 50 pesos you can buy a human spleen:::['9-19-95']
human spleen:::['9-19-96']
olé!:::['9-19-97']
you said you had customers lined up in the street, so i'm here to entertain.:::['9-19-99']
great. yeah, it really has been great too.:::['9-19-100']
they must have seen me play before......because they requested:::['9-19-101']
a bunch of my songs.:::['9-19-102']
yeah, "you suck"......and, um, "shut up and go home.":::['9-19-103']
listen, phoebe. yeah. you know how much i love listening to your music...:::['9-19-104']
...but... but what?:::['9-19-105']
um, this is kind of a classy place.:::['9-19-106']
okay, say no more.:::['9-19-107']
the woman smelled like garbage:::['9-19-108', '9-19-110']
everyone!:::['9-19-109']
classy, huh?:::['9-19-111']
hi, chandler bing. i have a reservation.:::['9-19-112']
welcome to the chestnut inn. where are you joining us from?:::['9-19-113']
new york. the big apple.:::['9-19-114']
he's wound up. we had to stop at every maple-candy stand on the way here.:::['9-19-115']
i ate all my gifts for everybody.:::['9-19-116']
i'm sorry, there's no record of your reservation in the computer.:::['9-19-117']
that's impossible. check again, please. check again, please.:::['9-19-118']
i'm sorry, it's not here. it's not there.:::['9-19-119']
let me get this straight. i called to try to cancel my reservation......was told it's not refundable.:::['9-19-120']
we drove six hours all the way up here...:::['9-19-121']
...and now we don't have a reservation? i don't know what to say.:::['9-19-122']
she doesn't know what to say.:::['9-19-123']
just give us the cheapest room you have.:::['9-19-124']
the only thing we have available is our deluxe suite. the rate is $600.:::['9-19-125']
that's insane. it's totally insane.:::['9-19-126']
let's drive home. we'll hit all the maple-candy stores on the way back......and if they're closed, then maybe we'll:::['9-19-127']
tap a tree and make some ourselves.:::['9-19-128']
does that room have a closet i can lock him in?:::['9-19-129']
we'll take it. great.:::['9-19-130']
they are totally ripping us off! dude, don't worry about it.:::['9-19-131']
i know how to make your money back. this is a nice hotel. plenty of amenities.:::['9-19-132']
we just load up on those. like those apples. instead of taking one......um, i take six.:::['9-19-133']
great. at $100 an apple, we're there.:::['9-19-134']
come on, you get the idea. you know, we'll make our money back in no time.:::['9-19-135']
dude, you're shaking. it's the sugar. could you hold the apple?:::['9-19-136']
joey, i got to tell you, i have been thinking all day about that scene you did.:::['9-19-138']
you were amazing. oh.:::['9-19-139']
you know, the writing was good. and the director's good.:::['9-19-140']
and my costar's good.:::['9-19-141']
but they're not as good as me!:::['9-19-142']
you have to tell me what happens tomorrow.:::['9-19-143']
i'm going over the script now. wanna read lines with me?:::['9-19-144']
me? oh, i'm not an actress.:::['9-19-145']
i can ask monica. screw her! that part is mine!:::['9-19-146']
joey: right.:::['9-19-147']
okay, so, uh, just from the top of the page right here.:::['9-19-148']
hello, drake. i'm surprised to see you here.:::['9-19-150']
i can't believe you married him. well, what choice did i have?:::['9-19-151']
he was keeping my sister in a dungeon.:::['9-19-152']
so, what about us? everything we feel for each other?:::['9-19-153']
it's over. you have to accept that.:::['9-19-154']
how can i, knowing i'll never hold you in my arms again......or touch your skin or feel your lips......knowing i'll never make love to you?:::['9-19-155']
how can i accept that i can never kiss you again......when it's all i can do not:::['9-19-156']
to kiss you right now?:::['9-19-157']
kiss me.:::['9-19-158', '9-19-160']
uh, rach, it doesn't say that. no, i'm saying it.:::['9-19-161']
but-- just don't talk.:::['9-19-162']
well, that's new.:::['9-19-163']
hi, this is ross geller in suite 206.:::['9-19-164']
um, i've forgotten a couple of things.:::['9-19-165']
could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room?:::['9-19-166']
thank you. okay, a toothbrush, toothpaste......razor, mouthwash, deodorant, floss,band-aids, shaving cream, after shave.:::['9-19-167']
and i feel like i'm forgetting something.:::['9-19-168']
um, is there anything else you have that i haven't asked for already?:::['9-19-169']
yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons.:::['9-19-170']
what'd you get? usa today.:::['9-19-171']
nice. put it with the others.:::['9-19-172']
and i also got two more apples.:::['9-19-173']
we're four short of a bushel!:::['9-19-174']
god, i feel so alive. i love being in the country!:::['9-19-175']
also, got these great salt and pepper shakers...:::['9-19-176']
...from the restaurant. that's not cool.:::['9-19-177']
dude, none of this is cool.:::['9-19-178']
look, chandler, you have to find the line between stealing......and taking what the hotel owes you.:::['9-19-179']
for example: a hair dryer, no, no, no.:::['9-19-180']
but shampoos and conditioners, yes,yes,yes.:::['9-19-181']
now, the salt shaker is off limits. ah.:::['9-19-182']
but the salt...:::['9-19-183']
i wish i'd thought this through.:::['9-19-184']
i think i get what you mean, though. like, the lamp is the hotel's......but the bulbs--:::['9-19-185']
oh, you already got that.:::['9-19-186']
not my first time in a hotel, my friend.:::['9-19-187']
okay, uh, how about this? no, no, no.:::['9-19-188']
you can't take the remote control. yes, but the batteries.:::['9-19-189']
thank you. thank you very much.:::['9-19-190', '2-24-249']
ooh! let's celebrate with some maple candy. no!:::['9-19-191']
at least tell me where you hid it.:::['9-19-192']
can i ask you a question? yeah.:::['9-19-193', '9-20-22']
have you ever had any......weird, romantic dreams?:::['9-19-194']
hmm, let me think.:::['9-19-195']
oh. when i was younger, i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese.:::['9-19-196']
and on our wedding night, i ate his head.:::['9-19-197']
well, this is like that......in no way.:::['9-19-199']
i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey.:::['9-19-200']
wow! you mean like "kiss him" kiss him?:::['9-19-201']
oh, yeah. i mean, it was pretty intense.:::['9-19-202']
what brought that on? i don't know.:::['9-19-203']
maybe it had to do with the fact i saw him do a love scene.:::['9-19-204']
a love scene? with who? olivia.:::['9-19-205']
olivia? i thought she was marrying connor?:::['9-19-206']
oh, right. real life more important.:::['9-19-207']
you think my dream means anything? i don't know.:::['9-19-208']
i mean, you saw him do a love scene. maybe you don't have a thing for joey.:::['9-19-209']
maybe you have a thing for drake.:::['9-19-210']
huh...:::['9-19-211']
well, it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream.:::['9-19-212']
of course it was. trust me, when it comes to psychology......i know what i'm talking about.:::['9-19-213']
i took two psych classes in college. you took the same class twice.:::['9-19-214']
it was hard! i know.:::['9-19-215']
hey. rachel & monica: hi.:::['9-19-216']
here, monica, look what i got to wear when i play at your restaurant.:::['9-19-217']
ah. ah. wait.:::['9-19-218']
right? i think this might even class up "the ballad of the uncircumcised man.":::['9-19-219']
um, phoebe......maybe i wasn't clear before.:::['9-19-220']
i really love listening to your music here.:::['9-19-221']
but my restaurant, it's sort of an upscale place.:::['9-19-222']
right, yeah, okay. i'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.:::['9-19-223']
phoebe, it's not what you wear.:::['9-19-224']
it's sort of your songs.:::['9-19-225']
i just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.:::['9-19-226']
oh. okay. fine, i'll just--:::['9-19-227']
i'll take the hat back.:::['9-19-228']
hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened at work the--:::['9-19-230']
my songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?:::['9-19-231']
okay, we're still on that.:::['9-19-232']
i didn't say they weren't good enough. then what's wrong with them?:::['9-19-233']
what, they don't go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?:::['9-19-234']
tiny portions? yeah, well, um, "excuse me.:::['9-19-235']
i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but i can't see it. i can't see it.":::['9-19-236']
phoebe, it's not about quantity. well, it's not about quality.:::['9-19-237']
oh, really? you wanna talk about quality?:::['9-19-238']
have you ever heard of a "key"? it's what some people sing in.:::['9-19-239']
well, at least all my songs don't taste like garlic.:::['9-19-240']
yeah, there are other ingredients, monica.:::['9-19-241']
so that's what we're doing.:::['9-19-242']
when i'm in a coffeehouse bopping along to one of your songs...:::['9-19-243']
...i'm wearing earplugs. earplugs or cloves of garlic?:::['9-19-244']
you know what? i take back what i said before.:::['9-19-245']
keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside......my bar sales:::['9-19-246']
have gone up like crazy.:::['9-19-247']
what are people having, the garlic martini?:::['9-19-248']
here's your bill. we hope you enjoyed your stay.:::['9-19-249']
oh, we did. and you still have all your lamps.:::['9-19-250']
i didn't factor in the room tax. dude, don't worry about it.:::['9-19-251']
i found an unattended maid's cart. we're way ahead of the game.:::['9-19-252']
there's something new in the bowl.:::['9-19-254']
look, we have enough. just walk away. no, but i want the pine cones.:::['9-19-255']
there's a forest right outside. it's not the same.:::['9-19-256']
okay, go quick.:::['9-19-257']
thank you for a delightful stay.:::['9-19-258']
my maple candy!:::['9-19-259']
will kill you:::['9-19-260']
the food here at javu will kill you:::['9-19-261']
it's just you. i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.:::['9-19-262']
you'd better get back in that kitchen. the garlic's not gonna overuse itself.:::['9-19-263']
okay, you have to stop playing now. why?:::['9-19-264']
the only person my playing is bothering is you.:::['9-19-265']
oh, yeah? let's settle this. come on. get your garlic peelers off me.:::['9-19-266']
excuse me? excuse me?:::['9-19-267']
hi, i'm monica geller. i'm the head chef here.:::['9-19-268']
okay, i was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever.:::['9-19-269']
quick question. by a show of hands......how many of you were bothered:::['9-19-270']
by this woman's singing outside?:::['9-19-271']
okay, okay. how many of you enjoyed the music outside?:::['9-19-272']
let me ask you this question. how many thought the music was fine......but not in keeping with the tone:::['9-19-274']
of the restaurant?:::['9-19-275']
who identified this restaurant's tone as "pretentious-comma-garlicky"?:::['9-19-276']
okay, who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretension never hurt anyone?:::['9-19-277']
okay, well, all right, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine......but your evening was ruined:::['9-19-278']
by this incessant poll-taking?:::['9-19-279']
excuse us.:::['9-19-280', '7-19-219']
all right, here's a question.:::['9-19-281']
uh, who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy......that she made a big deal about:::['9-19-282']
her friend playing her music......and feels really bad about it now?:::['9-19-283']
well, who was so stupid and stubborn......that she lashed out:::['9-19-284']
against her friend's cooking......which she actually thinks:::['9-19-285']
is pretty great?:::['9-19-286']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry too.:::['9-19-287', '5-10-308']
hey, you wanna stick around and i'll whip you up some dinner?:::['9-19-288']
yeah, as long as it's free. the food here is ridiculously overpr--:::['9-19-289']
who hopes the hand-raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?:::['9-19-290']
joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?:::['9-19-292']
oh, man. i thought i got it all.:::['9-19-293']
how...?:::['9-19-294']
how?:::['9-19-295', '5-23-291', '5-8-255']
i was making a peanut butter smoothie, right?:::['9-19-296']
i couldn't find this little plastic thingy that goes in the top of the blender.:::['9-19-297']
and i thought, "well, you know, how important can that be?" right?:::['9-19-298']
turns out, very.:::['9-19-299']
wow, definitely just drake.:::['9-19-300']
what? how's it going with drake?:::['9-19-301']
i don't think it's going very well. what?:::['9-19-302']
that scene i saw was so good.:::['9-19-303']
well, i'm feeling really insecure about the one we're shooting tomorrow.:::['9-19-304']
is this that thing you do when you say you're bad so i'll give you a compliment?:::['9-19-305']
a little.:::['9-19-306', '5-20-347']
no, i really am worried. i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia.:::['9-19-307']
so? so i've never played that.:::['9-19-308']
oh, honey, it can't be that hard. i mean, you've been in love before.:::['9-19-309']
uh, well, just once......with you.:::['9-19-310']
okay. well, this could be a little awkward.:::['9-19-311']
i'm just gonna blow past it.:::['9-19-312']
well, look, can't you just use that method-actor thing......where you use your real-life memories:::['9-19-313']
to help you in your performance?:::['9-19-314']
what the hell are you talking about?:::['9-19-315']
all right, look, just, um, try to remember how you felt when you were in love......and think about that:::['9-19-316']
when you're playing the scene.:::['9-19-317']
okay. yeah, i think i can do that.:::['9-19-319']
yeah. okay, there's this party scene coming up.:::['9-19-320']
uh-huh. and olivia and her husband are there......and all drake wants to do is:::['9-19-321']
grab her and kiss her, but he can't.:::['9-19-322']
that makes me think about those times i wanted to grab you and kiss you......but you didn't know, so i would:::['9-19-323']
just pretend everything was cool......but really it was killing me.:::['9-19-324']
joey, you never talked about that before.:::['9-19-325']
hey, you know what else i could use?:::['9-19-327']
there's this scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom......and she doesn't know he's there,which never happened with us.:::['9-19-328']
i mean, he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her.:::['9-19-329']
and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your makeup......when i would think to myself,"my god, she is beautiful.":::['9-19-331']
and it hurt so much because i knew i could never tell you.:::['9-19-332']
but it was worth it just to be there looking at you.:::['9-19-333']
thanks, dude. this is great!:::['9-19-334']
i got you something from vermont.:::['9-19-335']
besides tampons and salt?:::['9-19-336']
maple candy. that's so sweet of you.:::['9-19-338']
that's weird, it's empty.:::['9-19-339']
hi, you guys. what's going on? you guys wanna hang out, or...?:::['9-19-340']
do you guys hear a buzzing?:::['9-19-341']
monica? hey, can i borrow the porsche?:::['9-18-0']
okay. all right!:::['9-18-1']
but, uh, ahem, what is it not?:::['9-18-2']
a place to entertain my lady friends.:::['9-18-3']
and what else is it not? a place to eat spaghetti.:::['9-18-4']
very good. joey: thanks.:::['9-18-5']
what do you need it for anyway? the, uh, lottery is up to 300 million...:::['9-18-6']
...and they don't sell tickets here. so you're driving up to connecticut?:::['9-18-7']
yeah, connecticut. not west virginia.:::['9-18-8']
maybe i'll drive you up there. i'd like to buy some tickets myself.:::['9-18-9']
yeah, with chandler not getting paid, we could really use $300 million.:::['9-18-10']
yes, because if i was at my old job, we'd say, "300 million? no, thank you.":::['9-18-11']
will you get me tickets too? yeah, me too.:::['9-18-12']
joey: sure. ooh! i have an idea.:::['9-18-13']
why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together......and then if we win, we'll split it.:::['9-18-14']
all: that's a great idea!:::['9-18-15']
you don't want to win the lottery? uh, sure i do.:::['9-18-17']
i also want to be king of my own country......and find out what happened:::['9-18-18']
to amelia earhart.:::['9-18-19']
still on amelia earhart? the woman just vanished!:::['9-18-20']
seriously, you don't want in on this?:::['9-18-21']
no. do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery?:::['9-18-22']
i mean, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.:::['9-18-23']
but there's six of us, so we'd only have to get struck 7 times.:::['9-18-24']
i like those odds!:::['9-18-25']
seriously, you guys, i can't believe you're gonna spend $250 on the lottery.:::['9-18-26']
i mean, that's such a bunch of boo-hockey.:::['9-18-27']
i'll ask.:::['9-18-28']
"boo-hockey"?:::['9-18-29']
oh, we think emma's about to start talking......so we're trying to be careful about:::['9-18-30']
what words we use in front of her.:::['9-18-31']
so get ready to hear a lot of, uh, boo-hockey......gosh darn it:::['9-18-32']
and brother pucker.:::['9-18-33']
how do you know she's gonna start talking?:::['9-18-34']
when i talk to her, i almost feel like she understands what i'm saying.:::['9-18-35']
kind of like joey.:::['9-18-36']
god, look at all these tickets. it's so exciting.:::['9-18-38']
i haven't won anything since sixth grade.:::['9-18-39']
pie-eating contest?:::['9-18-40']
you assume because i was heavy that's the only way i could win something?:::['9-18-41']
no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.:::['9-18-42']
that was a good day. chandler: yeah.:::['9-18-43']
they're towing your car! i'm parked in a garage on morton.:::['9-18-44']
they're towing a car.:::['9-18-45']
and i am seeing spots.:::['9-18-46']
ross, you don't have emma! rachel, you don't have emma!:::['9-18-47']
where's emma? who has emma? joey, relax.:::['9-18-48']
my mother picked her up two hours ago. you were there.:::['9-18-49']
i was? yes, and you talked to her.:::['9-18-50']
i did? she dropped off a casserole.:::['9-18-51']
oh, yeah, the casserole lady.:::['9-18-52']
did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?:::['9-18-53']
yeah. and then i figured after you win, we can all go out to the balcony......and see a night rainbow:::['9-18-54']
with gremlins dancing on top of it.:::['9-18-55']
don't touch the phone! i'll get it! i'll get it!:::['9-18-56']
you think he washed his hands? chandler: hello?:::['9-18-57']
hey, charlie, what do you know? what's going on?:::['9-18-58']
chandler's supposed to find out if he's getting a job at his agency.:::['9-18-59']
but out of 15 interns, they're only hiring three.:::['9-18-60']
ooh. tough odds. yeah.:::['9-18-61']
if only it were a sure thing like your 24-state lottery.:::['9-18-62']
yeah, look who's coming around!:::['9-18-63']
damn it. all right, call me when you know more.:::['9-18-64']
did you get it? one of the slots got filled.:::['9-18-65']
by you? sense the tone.:::['9-18-66']
no, that kid nate got it. oh, i hate that guy.:::['9-18-67']
i mean, come on, pull up your pants! chandler: i know.:::['9-18-68']
well, there's two spots left, right?:::['9-18-69']
yeah. i mean, i want this so much. i want to get one.:::['9-18-70']
i want my friend charlie to get one.:::['9-18-71']
except i don't care about charlie.:::['9-18-72']
all: hey!:::['9-18-73', '5-3-47', '4-4-262']
you are not gonna believe this. i just saw my psychic......and she said i was definitely:::['9-18-74']
gonna win the lottery tonight!:::['9-18-75']
i thought we could use some extra luck......so i brought a wishbone home:::['9-18-76']
from work.:::['9-18-77', '5-4-10']
a psychic and a wishbone? guys, give someone else a chance.:::['9-18-78']
all right, who wants to do it? ooh, can i?:::['9-18-79']
vegetarians never get to do the wishbone.:::['9-18-80']
it's really not fair. just because we don't eat the meat......doesn't mean we don't like:::['9-18-81']
to play with the carcasses.:::['9-18-82']
all right. rash'?:::['9-18-83']
i don't want that turkey smell all over my hands.:::['9-18-84']
i'll do it! it'll get the casserole stink off of mine.:::['9-18-85']
i hope i win. well, it doesn't really matter.:::['9-18-86']
you're both wishing for the same thing.:::['9-18-87']
i can't tell you what i'm wishing for, or else, you know, it won't come true. ha, ha.:::['9-18-88']
right. but we know what you're wishing for.:::['9-18-89']
i can't really say. i understand.:::['9-18-90']
but you're wishing for what we think, aren't you?:::['9-18-91']
i'm not really comfortable with these questions!:::['9-18-92']
please! just do it!:::['9-18-93']
okay. one, two, three.:::['9-18-94']
i won! hey!:::['9-18-95']
you know what? i'm sure your wish is gonna come true.:::['9-18-96']
but, you guys, just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp.:::['9-18-97']
qw!:::['9-18-98']
that thing gets hot!:::['9-18-99']
ross, just keep making yourjokes.:::['9-18-100']
how are you gonna feel if we actually do win?:::['9-18-101']
uh, you're not gonna win. i know the odds are against us......but somebody has to win, and it could:::['9-18-102']
be us. and then how you gonna feel?:::['9-18-103']
we're gonna be like, "everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape.":::['9-18-104']
and you're gonna be all, like, "oh, i can't, guys.:::['9-18-105']
i'll have to meet you up there. i gotta gas up the hyundai.":::['9-18-106']
okay, i've heard myself on tape, and i sound nothing like that.:::['9-18-107']
i can see the headline now: "lottery winners' friend......filled with regret,eats own arm.":::['9-18-108']
why would i eat my own arm?:::['9-18-109']
well, you wouldn't, but we own the paper. we can print whatever we want.:::['9-18-110']
you know what? i'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.:::['9-18-111']
why? because i know that you think......that the lottery is boo-hockey......but we're all here, and we're gonna:::['9-18-112']
watch the numbers and have fun.:::['9-18-113']
and you're my brother, and i want you to be a part of this.:::['9-18-114']
you don't have to do that. i mean, i'll pay for myself.:::['9-18-115']
but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys, that's so sweet.:::['9-18-116']
get a room.:::['9-18-118', '5-24-127']
so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?:::['9-18-119']
i don't know. i'll probably just invest it. ooh. calm down.:::['9-18-120']
seriously, that's your fantasy? to invest it?:::['9-18-121']
oh, i'm sorry. did i say, "invest it"? i meant, "be cool and piss it all away.":::['9-18-122']
oh! oh! i know! we should pool all our money and buy the knicks!:::['9-18-123']
i don't really care about the knicks.:::['9-18-124']
you will when i pick you as starting forward.:::['9-18-125']
you would do that? i never get picked!:::['9-18-126']
i'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.:::['9-18-127']
you won't let me buy the knicks? i can't believe you're taking this away.:::['9-18-128']
you're right, it has been your dream for over 15 seconds.:::['9-18-129']
uh, how long until they announce the numbers, mommy?:::['9-18-130']
i'll take this one too. uh, "mommy"?:::['9-18-131']
oh, i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel "mommy"......when we're around emma.:::['9-18-132']
which i now realize we are not.:::['9-18-133']
i'm hoping that if she hears it enough... ...it'll be her first word. oh.:::['9-18-134']
although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me "daddy" too.:::['9-18-135']
mm. i like that, daddy.:::['9-18-136']
i, uh-- i was just talking about rachel.:::['9-18-137']
ooh, is daddy getting angry?:::['9-18-138']
is daddy gonna spank me?:::['9-18-139']
well, that depends.:::['9-18-140']
have you been a bad--? no, i can't.:::['9-18-141']
hello? hello? hey, charlie. did anybody else hear?:::['9-18-142']
what? susan got it? how?:::['9-18-143']
oh, man, i would've slept with him!:::['9-18-144']
all right, bye.:::['9-18-145']
dude, i'm sorry. but hey, there's one spot left, right?:::['9-18-146']
well, charlie's gonna get that. hey, don't say that.:::['9-18-147']
you've got just as good a chance of getting that job.:::['9-18-148']
he is the boss' son.:::['9-18-149']
come on, lottery! yeah!:::['9-18-150']
it starts in, like, 20 minutes. okay, here we go.:::['9-18-151']
we need to sort through the tickets quickly to see if we've won.:::['9-18-152']
so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this?:::['9-18-153']
okay, how about this::::['9-18-154']
we divide them into six groups of 40.:::['9-18-155']
the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes first.:::['9-18-156']
i have another idea. i'm sorry, idea time is over.:::['9-18-157']
well, are all the tickets in the bowl? yeah.:::['9-18-158']
what about the ones on the nightstand? there are no tickets there.:::['9-18-159']
yes, there are. i just saw them a few minutes ago.:::['9-18-160']
heh. uh, no, you didn't. you must be mistaken.:::['9-18-161']
there are 20 tickets on the nightstand. chandler, sense the tone.:::['9-18-162']
well, well, well. look what mommy found.:::['9-18-163']
okay, fine. i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler.:::['9-18-164']
the psychic also said that i would be betrayed.:::['9-18-165']
i can't believe this. i thought we were all in this together.:::['9-18-166']
hey, you just got in five minutes ago! three minutes ago!:::['9-18-167']
i don't know why that's important.:::['9-18-168']
i was with you the whole time. when did you even get those?:::['9-18-169']
when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic.:::['9-18-170']
i'll show you how.:::['9-18-171']
okay. well, monica, suppose one of your special tickets wins?:::['9-18-172']
how are you gonna feel when you win and lose your friends?:::['9-18-173']
please. if i win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me.:::['9-18-174']
someone gave me muffins last week. i couldn't get rid of you for three days!:::['9-18-175']
chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?:::['9-18-176']
she's right. you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us.:::['9-18-177']
let me finish.:::['9-18-178']
however, it doesn't look like i'm gonna get this job......so i can't afford to have principles.:::['9-18-179']
so screw you! the tickets are ours!:::['9-18-180']
there's the man i married.:::['9-18-181']
all right. believe me, if you win the lottery......it's the last you're gonna hear from us.:::['9-18-182']
fine. don't be my friends. i'll buy new friends.:::['9-18-183']
yeah, and then i'll pay for their plastic surgery so they look just like you!:::['9-18-184']
you know what? i want my share of the tickets.:::['9-18-185']
i want my tickets too! and i'm buying the knicks!:::['9-18-186']
and steffi graf! ha, ha.:::['9-18-187']
cool. then i want mine too! and if i win......i'm gonna put it all:::['9-18-188']
into a very low-yield bond!:::['9-18-189']
no. you guys, we gotta keep all the tickets together.:::['9-18-190']
no. no, we should divide them up......and i should get extra because:::['9-18-191']
we used my car!:::['9-18-192']
hey! hey! if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me!:::['9-18-193']
this whole thing was my idea! yeah. thanks for inventing the lottery!:::['9-18-194']
just give them to me, and i'll split them up!:::['9-18-195']
_qw! ah!:::['9-18-196']
rossi hey, hey! aah!:::['9-18-197']
god, i can't take it anymore! i'm putting an end to this!:::['9-18-198']
okay, if she jumps, i get her tickets! wait, no, no! hey!:::['9-18-199']
if we're not doing this together, we're not doing it at all.:::['9-18-200']
say goodbye to your tickets. all: no! no! no!:::['9-18-201']
do not come any closer!:::['9-18-202']
can i come a little bit closer? valuable things are getting squished.:::['9-18-203']
now, what's more important, your friends or money?:::['9-18-204']
f?ends! monica: money!:::['9-18-205']
f?ends.:::['9-18-206']
hey, monica, what about your extra tickets?:::['9-18-207']
they're all in there.:::['9-18-208']
even these five that i hid in my bra. monica!:::['9-18-209']
okay. good. you guys were so scared.:::['9-18-210']
there is no way i was gonna dump this--:::['9-18-211']
i think i broke your bowl.:::['9-18-213']
go! go! go!:::['9-18-214', '9-23-623', '7-17-120']
what a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets.:::['9-18-215']
and the wind sure made it fun.:::['9-18-216']
phoebe, we lost half of them. so what?:::['9-18-217']
monica, we have the winning ticket.:::['9-18-218']
my psychic said i was gonna win, remember?:::['9-18-219']
weird your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon.:::['9-18-220']
as a matter of fact, she said that's how i'm going to die.:::['9-18-221']
so excuse me for being a little skittish.:::['9-18-222']
there's two messages. this could be from work.:::['9-18-223']
oh, play them. okay. here we go.:::['9-18-224']
phoebe: hello. this is the pigeon from the balcony calling to apologize.:::['9-18-225']
i shouldn't have knocked the tickets out of the pretty lady's hand.:::['9-18-226']
it was all my fault. not hers. bye. coo.:::['9-18-227']
well, i bet that was very hard for him to do.:::['9-18-228']
charlie: hey, chandler, it's charlie.:::['9-18-229']
this is it. shh, shh!:::['9-18-230']
listen, um, it turns out i got the last spot.:::['9-18-231']
i'm really sorry, man. it was a lot of fun working with you:::['9-18-232']
give me a call if you want.:::['9-18-233']
gosh, i'm so sorry, honey.:::['9-18-234']
joey: sorry, chandler.:::['9-18-235']
it is so unfair. it's like that time they promoted saundra over me at work.:::['9-18-236']
was she related to ralph lauren?:::['9-18-237']
no, she was just much better at her job than me.:::['9-18-238']
you guys, the drawing's about to start.:::['9-18-239']
we should call my mom's and say good night to emma...:::['9-18-240']
...before she goes down. good idea.:::['9-18-241']
honey, you're being really strong about this.:::['9-18-242']
i know how badly you wanted that job.:::['9-18-243']
yeah, you know, i really thought i deserved it.:::['9-18-244']
but let's go win the lottery. i mean, we still have a 130 chances to win, right?:::['9-18-245']
hundred and thirty-one.:::['9-18-246']
yeah, good night, sweetheart. i love you.:::['9-18-247']
and remember, you're daddy's little girl. heh.:::['9-18-248']
phoebe's totally ruined that for me.:::['9-18-249']
hi, mom. put her back on.:::['9-18-250']
rach, they're announcing the numbers!:::['9-18-251']
my god, i can already feel myself changing.:::['9-18-252']
here are your official powerball numbers. we have 53.:::['9-18-253']
i've got that. we have one too!:::['9-18-254']

mom, please, i know you love your new lips, but i can barely understand you.:::['9-18-257']
would you please just let me say good night to my daughter?:::['9-18-258']
announcer: and here we go. the powerball is seven.:::['9-18-259']
all right, check your numbers! make me rich.:::['9-18-260']
you guys, you're not gonna believe this.:::['9-18-261']
i was just saying good night to emma, and she said her first words.:::['9-18-262']
ross: what? well, what did she say?:::['9-18-263']
she said, "gleba"!:::['9-18-264']
make me rich!:::['9-18-265']
isn't that amazing? oh, yeah. no, no, no, that's great.:::['9-18-266']
why aren't you more excited?:::['9-18-267']
rach, heh, "gleba" is not a word.:::['9-18-268']
well, of course it is. okay. what does it mean?:::['9-18-269']
well, i don't know all the words.:::['9-18-270']
you know, i'm just glad i didn't miss my daughter's first word.:::['9-18-271']
yes you did! gleba is a word! okay. use it in a sentence.:::['9-18-272']
okay. uh, emma just said, "gleba:::['9-18-273']
it's not a word. ugh. okay, fine. i'm gonna look it up.:::['9-18-274']
ross: oh, okay, great.:::['9-18-275']
while you're at it, she said another word the other day. why don't you look up::::['9-18-276']
all right. okay. okay. gleba gleba. gleba. gleba!:::['9-18-277']
here it is! "the fleshy, spore-bearing inner mass of a certain fungi.":::['9-18-278']
she's gonna be a scientist.:::['9-18-280']
damn it. anybody got anything? chandler: no.:::['9-18-281']
i'm still looking through mine.:::['9-18-282']
just double-checking. no.:::['9-18-283']
hello? hold on.:::['9-18-286']
it's your boss.:::['9-18-287']
ah, the "i'm sorry i rejected you" phone call.:::['9-18-288']
i'm not used to getting these from guys.:::['9-18-289']
hey, steve. chandler, hi.:::['9-18-290']
i'm sure you've heard we filled the three positions.:::['9-18-291']
we felt that with your maturity and experience......you wouldn't be happy:::['9-18-292']
being someone's assistant.:::['9-18-293']
i'd love to be somebody's assistant. answering phones......getting coffee,i live for that stuff.:::['9-18-294']
and i'm not too mature. farts, boobies, butt cracks!:::['9-18-295']
chandler, you were the strongest person in the program.:::['9-18-296']
we're offering you the position of junior copywriter.:::['9-18-297']
me? that guy who just said, "butt cracks"?:::['9-18-298']
steve: yes, that's right.:::['9-18-299']
we're excited about the level of sophistication......you'll be bringing to the job.:::['9-18-300']
okay. well, thanks, you won't regret it. i'll see you tomorrow.:::['9-18-301']
oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a junior copywriter!:::['9-18-303']
congratulations! oh, sweetie, i'm so proud of you.:::['9-18-304']
thanks. does that mean i get the good loving tonight?:::['9-18-305']
you bet. no tv or anything.:::['9-18-306']
hey, that is so great about the job. chandler: thanks, man.:::['9-18-307']
i'd like to think i had something to do with it.:::['9-18-308']
really? why? well, before with the wishbone.:::['9-18-309']
i, uh, didn't wish we would win the lottery. i wished you'd get the job.:::['9-18-310']
qh, yeah?:::['9-18-311']
don't tell monica. she'll rip your heart out.:::['9-18-312']
well, you know what? there was a little part of me......that really thought we were gonna win.:::['9-18-314']
me too. so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park.:::['9-18-315']
you guys? what was the powerball number again?:::['9-18-316']
seven. we won.:::['9-18-317']
what? we won!:::['9-18-318']
monica: let me see! let me see! don't tear it!:::['9-18-319']
phoebe, you don't have any of the first five numbers!:::['9-18-320']
i know that, but look, we got the powerball number. we won $3!:::['9-18-321']
wow, you think we should get that over 20 years or go for the big payout?:::['9-18-322']
i don't care. i've never won anything before. i can't believe this!:::['9-18-323']
so, pheebs, what are you gonna do with your $3?:::['9-18-324']
well, it's not all mine. we all get 50 cents.:::['9-18-325']
aw. you know what? you can have mine.:::['9-18-326']
me too. me too.:::['9-18-327']
rachel: me too. ha, ha.:::['9-18-328']
well, i guess if everybody else is.:::['9-18-329']
hey, guys. so i just called the powerball hot line.:::['9-18-330']
can you believe it? nobody won. um, i beg to differ.:::['9-18-331']
maybe nobody won the jackpot, but there was this guy in here earlier......and he found a ticket on the street:::['9-18-332']
right outside and won $10,000.:::['9-18-333']
coo. again, don't blame the pretty lady.:::['9-18-334']
it was not her fault. it was me, the pigeon. coo.:::['9-18-335']
seriously, stop staring at her.:::['9-18-336']
hey! i'm all packed and ready to go.:::['9-23-0']
oh, that's right. daddy and uncle joey are going on a trip today.:::['9-23-1']
we're going to a conference in barbados. right?:::['9-23-2']
uh-huh. can you say, "barbados"?:::['9-23-3']
barbados.:::['9-23-4']
okay. i've gotta say, it means so much to me that you guys are coming......all the way over there:::['9-23-5']
to hear me give my speech.:::['9-23-6']
ooh, and i have a surprise. i had to pull some strings......but i was able to get everyone passes:::['9-23-7']
to the entire conference. that's right!:::['9-23-8']
these babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.:::['9-23-9']
do you have anything that will get us out of them?:::['9-23-10']
we're excited to hear the speech, but the rest of the time......we're gonna want to do island stuff.:::['9-23-11']
david'll probably want to hear a few lectures.:::['9-23-12']
right, because he's a scientist. phoebe: no, no.:::['9-23-13']
he's been in minsk for eight years. if he gets too much direct sunlight......he'll die.:::['9-23-14']
okay, we'd better go. yeah?:::['9-23-15']
so we'll see you guys tomorrow. all right, let's do it.:::['9-23-16']
a five-hour flight with charlie, have a couple drinks......get under that blanket:::['9-23-17']
and do what comes natural.:::['9-23-18']
it's a blanket, joe, not a cloak of invisibility.:::['9-23-19']
wow, this place is beautiful! look at all these paleontologists!:::['9-23-20']
i know. there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow.:::['9-23-21']
sarah: oh, my god, i can't believe you're here!:::['9-23-22']
i think i've been recognized.:::['9-23-23']
this happens all the time. dr. geller? i am such a huge fan.:::['9-23-24']
that never happens.:::['9-23-25']
i've been following your career for years. i can't wait for your keynote speech.:::['9-23-26']
wow. this is very flattering... i would love your autograph.:::['9-23-27']
well, sure. um...:::['9-23-28']
"dear?" sarah.:::['9-23-29']
"sarah. i dig you.":::['9-23-30']
"dr. ross geller." oh, thank you so much.:::['9-23-31']
sure. sarah, i'd like you to introduce you to my colleague, professor wheeler.:::['9-23-32']
and this is joey tribbiani. are you a paleontologist?:::['9-23-33']
no, god, no, no. i'm an actor.:::['9-23-34']
you probably recognize me from a little show called the days of our lives.:::['9-23-35']
dude, it's just days of our lives. there's no "the.":::['9-23-36']
okay, ross, boy, you... yeah. no, no. i play dr. drake ramoray.:::['9-23-37']
i'm sorry. i don't own a tv. you don't own a tv?:::['9-23-38']
what's all your furniture pointed at?:::['9-23-39']
david, can you help me?:::['9-23-40']
i'm trying to explain to chandler how a plane stays in the air.:::['9-23-41']
oh, certainly. that's a combination of bernoulli's principle......and newton's third law of motion.:::['9-23-42']
yeah. that's the same as, "it has something to do with wind.":::['9-23-44']
i'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.:::['9-23-45']
i should go too. now, tomorrow do you want to share a cab to the airport......or should mike and i meet you?:::['9-23-46']
mike? who's mike?:::['9-23-47']
mike's your ex-boyfriend. that's right!:::['9-23-48']
oh, yeah. wow, i had totally forgotten about him.:::['9-23-49']
that's a blast from the past, huh? no, it's okay. honest mistake.:::['9-23-50']
it really doesn't mean anything. i mean, you know......monica refers to chandler as richard:::['9-23-51']
all the time.:::['9-23-52']
she does? let's get you out of here.:::['9-23-53']
well, at least you took me down with you.:::['9-23-54']
i'm so sorry. i just... i keep thinking about mike.:::['9-23-55']
i'm crazy about david, and we're having so much fun together.:::['9-23-56']
why? why do i miss mike? that's just... that's gonna go away, right?:::['9-23-57']
well, i guess. in time. yeah.:::['9-23-58']
i mean, my feelings for richard are certainly gone.:::['9-23-59']
you just did it again. chandler. your feelings for chandler are certainly gone.:::['9-23-60']
boy, phoebe's still pretty hung up on that mike, huh?:::['9-23-61']
i wouldn't read too much into it.:::['9-23-62']
still, a girl calls you by her ex-boyfriend's name......that's not a good thing, right?:::['9-23-63']
let me stop you there.:::['9-23-64']
because i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice.:::['9-23-65']
see, if you want advice, go to ross or monica. or joey......for advice about pizza toppings:::['9-23-66']
or a burning sensation when you pee.:::['9-23-67']
i'm sorry, i just wish there was something i could do, you know?:::['9-23-68']
well, you know phoebe... seriously, we're gonna do this?:::['9-23-69']
i'm sorry, i just wish i could make her forget about mike already.:::['9-23-70']
why did phoebe and mike break up? oh, because his penis was too big.:::['9-23-71']
i'm sorry. that's the kind of thing i do.:::['9-23-72']
they broke up because mike didn't want to get married.:::['9-23-73']
what if you let phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?:::['9-23-74']
that's great. that's great. i'll propose to her.:::['9-23-75']
i was probably going to do it at some point.:::['9-23-77']
no, i didn't mean now. well, why not? it's brilliant.:::['9-23-78']
"goodbye, mike. we'll see you at the wedding, fella.:::['9-23-79']
well, we probably won't invite you to the wedding, but...":::['9-23-80']
well, thank you, chandler. sincerely. well, you're welcome.:::['9-23-81']
glad i could help.:::['9-23-82']
how do you think i should propose? i'm pretending to read here.:::['9-23-83']
yeah. how you doing?:::['9-23-85']
hey, hey. hey.:::['9-23-86']
you said you were gonna wear a thong. where's the thong?:::['9-23-87']
ha, ha, i didn't mean a thong. i meant thongs.:::['9-23-88']
you really should have been more clear about that.:::['9-23-89']
you're never gonna guess who i just saw downstairs.:::['9-23-90']
oh, uh, uh, britney spears!:::['9-23-91']
yeah. she never misses these conferences.:::['9-23-92']
no, i just saw dr. kenneth schwartz! oh, my god!:::['9-23-93']
i know! did you talk to him?:::['9-23-94']
oh, yeah. what am i gonna say to kenneth schwartz?:::['9-23-95']
you could say, "hey, kenny, how come you're not britney spears?":::['9-23-96']
you ready to go? you're gonna go now?:::['9-23-97']
i thought we could hang out. i can't. i have seminars all day.:::['9-23-98']
i promised ross i'd look at his speech.:::['9-23-99']
but maybe we could have dinner later? out on the balcony? lt'll be romantic.:::['9-23-100']
will you wear a thong?:::['9-23-101']
i will if you will.:::['9-23-102']
you got yourself a very weird deal.:::['9-23-103']
i'm good. i have dinner plans.:::['9-23-104']
so you gonna be okay? yeah, yeah.:::['9-23-105']
i got tons of stuff i could do. i'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming.:::['9-23-106']
joe, have you looked outside?:::['9-23-107']
oh, man. there's an indoor pool.:::['9-23-109']
you could swim there. yeah.:::['9-23-110']
i wasn't gonna swim. i was gonna dig a hole.:::['9-23-111']
that "mike" was interesting. i don't know what's gonna happen......with phoebe and david.:::['9-23-112']
i do. want a hint, huh?:::['9-23-113']
i do.:::['9-23-114', '10-12-419', '10-12-422', '2-24-241', '4-24-253']
okay, i'm sensing this is some kind of wordplay......because you are pink:::['9-23-115']
with barely controlled glee.:::['9-23-116']
david's gonna propose to phoebe. what? why?:::['9-23-117']
because we were talking about ways he could beat mike......and i told him phoebe wanted:::['9-23-118']
to get married.:::['9-23-119']
chandler, we have talked about this.:::['9-23-120']
you are not supposed to give people advice!:::['9-23-121']
couldn't you have made some inappropriate joke?:::['9-23-122']
i did! a penis one!:::['9-23-123']
just so i know, what was so wrong about what i said?:::['9-23-124']
they've only been going out for a few weeks.:::['9-23-125']
phoebe is completely hung up on mike. i mean, she'll say no......david's heart will be broken,it'll be too hard for them to recover......and then phoebe will end up:::['9-23-126']
alone again.:::['9-23-127']
man, that's some bad advice.:::['9-23-128']
oh, hey. thank god. you guys are here.:::['9-23-129']
what's going on? everything is upside-down here.:::['9-23-130']
it rains all day long and nobody watches tv, and ross is famous.:::['9-23-131']
i don't want to alarm anybody......but monica's hair is twice as big:::['9-23-132']
as it was when we landed.:::['9-23-133']
okay. when i go places with high humidity......it gets a little extra body, okay?:::['9-23-134']
that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross.:::['9-23-135']
i'll show you guys where to check in.:::['9-23-136']
oh, honey? can you make sure we get a king-size bed?:::['9-23-137']
oh, david, get one for us too. oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one.:::['9-23-138']
and with mirrors on the ceiling.:::['9-23-139']
and make sure our room isn't next to theirs.:::['9-23-140']
oh, you guys are so lucky you're here with people.:::['9-23-141']
you know, it's just such a romantic place.:::['9-23-142']
i just wish i could share it with a guy.:::['9-23-143']
not joey. not joey. no.:::['9-23-144']
i was just lusting after chandler. yeah, right.:::['9-23-145']
so i'm proposing to phoebe tonight.:::['9-23-146']
tonight?:::['9-23-147']
isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond?:::['9-23-148']
yes, well, being a failed scientist......doesn't pay quite as well:::['9-23-150']
as you might think.:::['9-23-151']
that's one-seventieth of a carat.:::['9-23-152']
and the clarity is quite poor.:::['9-23-153']
nice.:::['9-23-154', '7-15-246', '7-16-252', '10-8-308', '2-19-336', '5-11-190', '5-16-321']
monica, can i talk to you for a second? okay.:::['9-23-155']
david's gonna propose to phoebe tonight.:::['9-23-156']
see what happens when you give people advice?:::['9-23-157']
well, i hope you told him not to. that would be advice!:::['9-23-158']
okay, fine. i'll handle this.:::['9-23-159']
i need to talk to you. are you leaving the supremes?:::['9-23-161']
okay, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice.:::['9-23-162']
david's gonna propose to you tonight.:::['9-23-163']
wow, really?:::['9-23-164']
that's fantastic!:::['9-23-165']
what? are you serious? you want to marry him?:::['9-23-166']
what about mike? oh, okay, you want me to marry mike?:::['9-23-167']
let's just gag him and handcuff him......and force him down the aisle, okay?:::['9-23-168']
i can just see it. "mike, do you take phoebe?":::['9-23-169']
you know? it's every girl's dream.:::['9-23-170']
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?:::['9-23-171']
sure. look, okay, bottom line? i love mike... david!:::['9-23-172']
david! i love david.:::['9-23-173']
don't look at me that way, roseanne roseannadanna.:::['9-23-174']
"by using ct scans and computer imaging, we can, in a very real way......bring the mesozoic era:::['9-23-175']
into the 21 st century.":::['9-23-176']
it's great.:::['9-23-177']
you'll be the hit of the conference.:::['9-23-178']
it'll be even better tomorrow......because i won't be constantly:::['9-23-179']
interrupted by joey......checking to see if they put:::['9-23-180']
chocolates on my pillow yet.:::['9-23-181']
hey, guys. the chocolates aren't here.:::['9-23-182']
damn it!:::['9-23-183', '9-23-250', '7-3-266', '10-3-153', '5-4-219']
ross just read me his speech. it's fantastic.:::['9-23-184']
oh, is it on the computer? because i'd love to give it a read.:::['9-23-185']
if you want to check your e-mail, just ask.:::['9-23-186']
what? may i?:::['9-23-187']
what's with the rain, geller? i mean, when i signed up for dino week......nobody said anything:::['9-23-188']
about it being monsoon season.:::['9-23-189']
the wet season is june to december. it's not the time, charlie.:::['9-23-190']
oh, no. no, no! dear god, no!:::['9-23-191']
what, did someone outbid you for the teapot?:::['9-23-192']
secret teapot.:::['9-23-193']
your computer. i don't know what... everything's gone.:::['9-23-194']
what do you mean? chandler: must be a virus.:::['9-23-195']
i think it erased your hard drive.:::['9-23-196']
what? oh, my god. what did you do?:::['9-23-197']
someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.:::['9-23-198']
why? why would you open it? well, it didn't say, "this is a virus.":::['9-23-199']
what did it say? "nude...":::['9-23-200']
"pictures of anna kournikova.":::['9-23-201']
i'm so sorry. what am i gonna do?:::['9-23-202']
my speech is gone! it's not gone.:::['9-23-203']
i'm sure you printed out a copy. you have a hard copy?:::['9-23-204']
no, i don't!:::['9-23-205']
well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now.:::['9-23-206']
it's really gone? yep.:::['9-23-207']
i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here......to complain about the rain:::['9-23-208']
and ruin my career.:::['9-23-209']
i just feel awful. yeah, you should.:::['9-23-210']
nude pictures of anna kournikova? she's never even won a major tournament.:::['9-23-211']
well, i tried billie jean king, but...:::['9-23-212']
you know, you and monica have the same i'm-gonna-kill-you look.:::['9-23-213']
i can usually make it go away by kissing her.:::['9-23-214']
get out.:::['9-23-215', '5-22-233', '5-2-136']
you know, this happens all the time to my computer at work.:::['9-23-216']
what do you do? i usually go......play tetris on somebody else's:::['9-23-217']
computer.:::['9-23-218']
i can't believe this is happening.:::['9-23-219', '5-5-257']
i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow.:::['9-23-220']
i have to stand up in front of all these people. what am i gonna say?:::['9-23-221']
you can use a speech i memorized for auditions.:::['9-23-222']
i don't think your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now.:::['9-23-223']
ross, we can solve this. i just heard your speech.:::['9-23-224']
we can re-create it. we've got all night. what, you really think we can do that?:::['9-23-225']
oh, wait. joey and i are supposed to have dinner.:::['9-23-226']
don't worry about that. i mean, ross needs you.:::['9-23-227']
rachel and i will stay and help any way we can.:::['9-23-228']
all right. okay, let's do it.:::['9-23-229']
well, i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating.:::['9-23-230']
and then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment......of the mesozoic era,the breakup of pangaea. hello?:::['9-23-231']
and then there's the overview of the triassic.:::['9-23-232']
ooh, ooh. any chance any of this happened in a galaxy far, far away?:::['9-23-233']
hello? monica: okay, mike?:::['9-23-234']
enough is enough. you love phoebe, and she loves you.:::['9-23-235']
so get over your i-never-wanna-get-married thing......and step up!:::['9-23-236']
who is this?:::['9-23-237']
this is monica, phoebe's friend.:::['9-23-238']
listen. phoebe is back with david.:::['9-23-239']
he's gonna propose, and she's gonna say yes......but i know she really wants to be:::['9-23-240']
with you.:::['9-23-241', '4-9-149']
he's gonna propose?:::['9-23-242']
i'm sorry, did you say something? i can't hear through all this damned hair!:::['9-23-243']
if phoebe wants to marry david, she should.:::['9-23-244']
i'm not gonna stand in the way of that. neither should you.:::['9-23-245']
you don't tell me what to do. i tell you what to do.:::['9-23-246']
just call her. she's at the paradise hotel in barbados.:::['9-23-247']
and while i've got you, you've got curly hair.:::['9-23-248']
what do you do in the humidity?:::['9-23-249']
well, i hope you're happy. aw, i hope you're happy too, honey.:::['9-23-251']
phoebe's going to say yes to david.:::['9-23-252']
that's what happens when you meddle. phoebe's gonna say yes? that's great.:::['9-23-253']
no, it's not. she's still in love with mike.:::['9-23-254']
there's no chance that will work? no, i called.:::['9-23-255']
it's not gonna happen. meddler! meddler!:::['9-23-256']
if you hadn't meddled to start with......then i wouldn't have had to go in:::['9-23-257']
and meddle myself.:::['9-23-258']
no matter how much we meddle, we'll never be able to unmeddle......the thing that you meddled up:::['9-23-259']
in the first place!:::['9-23-260']
this vacation sucks!:::['9-23-261']
i'm so bored. mm.:::['9-23-262']
stupid rain. we can't do anything.:::['9-23-263']
well, i brought some books. we could read.:::['9-23-264']
hey, it hasn't come to that yet.:::['9-23-265']
hey, hey, hey, don't mind if i do.:::['9-23-266']
i'm sorry, sir, these are for the pharmaceutical convention.:::['9-23-267']
you feel like going to a convention?:::['9-23-268']
we can't. we're not pharmacists. i know we're not......but frank madaio and eva...:::['9-23-269']
kate miller. kate miller it is.:::['9-23-270']
okay. oh, good...:::['9-23-271']
and that's the most sex i'm gonna have this weekend.:::['9-23-272']
well, in that case, should i make sure it's on real good?:::['9-23-273']
oh, and then you said that thing about bringing the mesozoic era......into the 21 st century.:::['9-23-275']
well, yeah. that's it?:::['9-23-276']
yeah. oh, my god. we did it.:::['9-23-277']
actually, i did it, ross. you remembered shockingly little of your own speech.:::['9-23-278']
yes, but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products.:::['9-23-279']
oh, this is amazing. thank you. thank you so much.:::['9-23-280']
that's a pretty necklace.:::['9-23-281']
hey, what do you say we celebrate? champagne?:::['9-23-283']
yeah! save the cork, and that way, we can fill the bottle with water......and put it back so they:::['9-23-284']
don't charge you.:::['9-23-285']
oh, my god, i love you.:::['9-23-286']
this is such a cute picture of emma. and is this your son......or just some kid whose picture:::['9-23-287']
you bring on vacation?:::['9-23-288']
that's ben, my son from my first marriage.:::['9-23-289']
your first marriage? ross: yeah.:::['9-23-290']
you've been married more than once?:::['9-23-291']
so why'd you break up?:::['9-23-294']
oh, it was...:::['9-23-295']
it's complicated, you know? she was, uh......gay.:::['9-23-296']
this is so cool!:::['9-23-298']
okay. odd thing to get excited about.:::['9-23-299']
no, it's just that i was engaged to a guy who turned out to be gay.:::['9-23-300']
hey! high-five!:::['9-23-301']
didn't you feel so stupid that you didn't see the signs?:::['9-23-302']
my fiancé was always going on long weekends with his "tennis partner.":::['9-23-303']
my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with every day for a year.:::['9-23-304']
she didn't get any fitter.:::['9-23-305']
everybody's like, "i knew all along." i know.:::['9-23-306']
if you knew, why didn't you tell me? i mean, call, leave a note.:::['9-23-307']
"hi. just dropped by to say your wife's gay.":::['9-23-308']
i know. and then...:::['9-23-309']
and then you try to make the best of a bad situation......so you float the idea of a threesome.:::['9-23-310']
i didn't do that.:::['9-23-311']
well, who knew? pharmacists are fun.:::['9-23-313']
i know. that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.:::['9-23-314']
not enough pills in the world, rach.:::['9-23-315']
what about you, huh? you're the single one. see anybody in there you like?:::['9-23-316']
well, let's see. there was that really big guy that i was talking to......with the really nice breasts.:::['9-23-317']
but what about back home?:::['9-23-318']
anything going on there? anybody you like?:::['9-23-319']
there is. you're blushing. no, i'm not blushing......and i'm sunburned.:::['9-23-321']
from, you know, the rain.:::['9-23-322']
you like someone. tell me who.:::['9-23-323']
tell me who it is. come on. no. joey.:::['9-23-324']
who do you like? you're not getting away that easy.:::['9-23-325']
who do you like? joey, come on!:::['9-23-326']
it doesn't matter, you know? it's not like anything's gonna happen.:::['9-23-327']
what? why not? rach, who can you not get?:::['9-23-328']
okay. okay. you really want to know who it is?:::['9-23-329']
yeah. who is it? do you?:::['9-23-330']
yeah. charlie: hey.:::['9-23-331']
ross: hey. charlie: i just left you a message.:::['9-23-332']
ross and i were gonna go grab a bite......but now that you're here,we could have that dinner.:::['9-23-333']
right! of course. hey, did you guys finish the speech?:::['9-23-334']
yep! we got it. we got it. thank you so much.:::['9-23-335']
i had a great time. yeah.:::['9-23-336']
this isn't over, because i really want to know...:::['9-23-337']
later. later.:::['9-23-338']
charlie: so shall we? yeah.:::['9-23-339']
okay. good night.:::['9-23-340']
good night.:::['9-23-341', '10-1-369', '10-13-141', '10-16-230', '2-7-260', '2-4-268', '4-6-290', '3-25-289', '3-5-141']
okay, good night. good night, ross.:::['9-23-342']
i can't believe she's gonna say yes to david.:::['9-23-343']
she's clearly in love with mike.:::['9-23-344']
you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.:::['9-23-345']
um... phoebe, um, i have, uh, something i want to say.:::['9-23-346']
oh, god, he's gonna do it. i cannot watch this. let's go.:::['9-23-347']
i think we have time. have you heard him talk?:::['9-23-348']
"uh, phoebe, um, i would be honored if, uh, uh..." spit it out, david!:::['9-23-349']
uh, phoebe, um...:::['9-23-350']
you're an amazing woman, and the time we spent apart was unbearable.:::['9-23-351']
of course, the sanitation strikes in minsk didn't help.:::['9-23-352']
sure. okay. yeah.:::['9-23-353']
but, um, well, now that we're together again, i don't ever want to be apart.:::['9-23-354']
so to that end...:::['9-23-355']
oh, my god, mike. it's david, actually.:::['9-23-356']
no, mike's here.:::['9-23-357']
oh, hey, mike.:::['9-23-358']
hi, david.:::['9-23-359']
chandler. monic... oh!:::['9-23-360']
it's the humidity!:::['9-23-361']
hi, phoebe. what are you doing here?:::['9-23-362']
i have a question i need to ask you.:::['9-23-363']
i have a question i was kind of gonna ask her myself.:::['9-23-364']
yeah, i understand, but before you do, she really needs to hear this.:::['9-23-365']
would you care for my seat as well? actually, yeah, that'd be great.:::['9-23-367']
well, that's fair, you've had a long trip.:::['9-23-368']
phoebe, i love you.:::['9-23-369', '10-5-402']
i've missed you so much these last few months.:::['9-23-370']
i thought we were apart for a good reason......but i realized that there was no reason:::['9-23-371']
good enough......to keep me from spending:::['9-23-372']
the rest of my life with you.:::['9-23-373']
kind of steps on the toes of what i was going to say.:::['9-23-374']
i'm sorry, david, but she really has to know this.:::['9-23-375']
all right, but after this, i want to see you outside.:::['9-23-376']
if the rain stops.:::['9-23-377']
you're the most incredible woman i've ever met.:::['9-23-378']
how could i lose you? now, i don't actually have a ring.:::['9-23-379']
i have a ring. i wouldn't brag about that, big guy.:::['9-23-380']
but, phoebe......will you marry me?:::['9-23-381']
ha-ha.:::['9-23-383']
i love you, but i never needed a proposal from you.:::['9-23-384']
i just needed to know we were headed somewhere.:::['9-23-385']
that we had a future. we can have any future you want.:::['9-23-386']
okay, well, i'm gonna take off.:::['9-23-387']
david, i'm so sorry. i'm sorry.:::['9-23-388']
just so i know, if i had asked first?:::['9-23-389']
yeah, i might have said yes, but that would've been wrong.:::['9-23-390']
please, you don't have to explain.:::['9-23-391']
i mean, perhaps if i hadn't gone to minsk......things would have worked out for us,and i wouldn't have ruined my career.:::['9-23-392']
or lost that toe to frostbite.:::['9-23-393']
it was a good trip.:::['9-23-394']
is it okay if i hug you now? oh, yes.:::['9-23-395']
because of our meddling! all right?:::['9-23-396']
oh, isn't this nice? it's so quiet. i could just lie here all day.:::['9-23-397']
oh, i know.:::['9-23-398', '7-6-68', '7-1-100', '10-3-52']
open your drapes! open your drapes! so glad we got adjoining rooms.:::['9-23-399']
the sun is out! hey! remember when i had corneas?:::['9-23-400']
go to the pool and reserve chairs.:::['9-23-401']
i will get the magazines and the lotion. ladies? ross' speech is in 45 minutes.:::['9-23-402']
no! damn it!:::['9-23-403']
ross: walls are pretty thin, guys.:::['9-23-404']
"then we have to weigh the data from recent mri scans and dna testing......which call into question information:::['9-23-405']
gathered from years of carbon dating.":::['9-23-406']
look at the woman sitting out by the pool getting tan.:::['9-23-407']
she's all leathery and wrinkled. i'm so jealous!:::['9-23-408']
"finally, factor in the profusion of new species recently discovered.:::['9-23-409']
giganotosaurus.:::['9-23-410']
argentinosaurus." not to mention coldsaurus.:::['9-23-411']
"and that's just the herbivores. i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores.:::['9-23-412']
their heads are already too big.:::['9-23-413']
which is ironic, considering their stunted cerebral development.":::['9-23-414']
"but all kidding aside, in much the same way......that homo ergaster is thought to be a:::['9-23-416']
separate species from homo erectus...":::['9-23-417']
what? he said "erectus.":::['9-23-418']
you're kidding, right? no, he really said it.:::['9-23-419']
"and while there are certainly vast differences......between these mesozoic fossils:::['9-23-420']
and the example of homo erectus...":::['9-23-421']
erectus?:::['9-23-422']
homo. right.:::['9-23-423']
"in a very real way, we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21 st century.":::['9-23-424']
rachel: really great. thanks, guys.:::['9-23-426']
i thought it was wonderful.:::['9-23-427']
jarvis oberblau. cornell.:::['9-23-428']
i mean, the ideas you put forth, and from someone so young and...:::['9-23-429']
okay, now we're just holding hands.:::['9-23-430']
alrighty. we're gonna hit the beach. that was really great.:::['9-23-431']
oh, thank you. yeah. oh, and so funny.:::['9-23-432']
take it easy. all right, thanks. thanks so much.:::['9-23-433']
i can't tell you how much it means that you were here.:::['9-23-434']
you kidding? we wouldn't have missed it.:::['9-23-435']
i'm back.:::['9-23-437']
okay. well, excuse me?:::['9-23-438']
well? you were incredible.:::['9-23-440']
you blew them away.:::['9-23-441']
i can't tell you how great it was to look in the crowd and see your face.:::['9-23-442']
i mean, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?:::['9-23-443']
i was not. no, it's okay.:::['9-23-444']
it made me feel like a rock star.:::['9-23-445']
oh, my god. i'm your groupie.:::['9-23-446']
hey, i better not find you naked in my hotel room.:::['9-23-447']
look, i took it too far.:::['9-23-448']
monica: i can't believe it's raining again. it's so unfair.:::['9-23-449']
phoebe: well, on the bright side, now we won't have to see......all these paleontologists:::['9-23-450']
with their shirts off.:::['9-23-451']
not you guys.:::['9-23-452']
you've got it going on.:::['9-23-453']
what will we do today? they have a game room downstairs.:::['9-23-454']
they have ping-pong and stuff.:::['9-23-455']
ping-pong? honey, they have ping-pong.:::['9-23-456']
let's play. i don't think so.:::['9-23-457']
why not? you know how competitive you get.:::['9-23-458']
and while i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying.:::['9-23-459']
i'm not always that bad. oh, yeah?:::['9-23-460']
what happened when we played last time?:::['9-23-461']
i punched you.:::['9-23-462']
and? phoebe.:::['9-23-463']
and? i clunked your heads together.:::['9-23-464']
there you are. hey. listen.:::['9-23-465']
as soon as it stops raining, we have got to go snorkeling.:::['9-23-466']
some kid told me about this sea turtle. if you blow bubbles in his face......he chases you.:::['9-23-467']
i'm sorry, i can't. i'm running a discussion group all afternoon.:::['9-23-468']
that's okay. i'll find someone else to do it.:::['9-23-470']
i'd do it alone, but, uh......i don't know what happens:::['9-23-471']
if the sea turtle catches you.:::['9-23-472']
you know, i feel so bad.:::['9-23-473']
i haven't seen you this whole trip. especially last night...:::['9-23-474']
don't worry about it. it was fine. i had the best time with rachel.:::['9-23-475']
i just felt bad for you, stuck in that room working on ross' speech.:::['9-23-476']
actually, it turned out to be a lot of fun.:::['9-23-477']
oh, well, at least we're both having fun, right?:::['9-23-478']
is it weird that it's not with each other? yeah.:::['9-23-479']
a little bit, yeah.:::['9-23-480']
i think we need to talk.:::['9-23-481']
yeah, i think we do.:::['9-23-482']
about what?:::['9-23-483', '9-11-254', '7-24-33', '4-3-181', '3-20-277']
come on, you guys, it'll be fun! all right.:::['9-23-484']
i'll play if we don't keep score. well, then how do we know who wins?:::['9-23-485']
nobody wins. so we're just four losers. super.:::['9-23-486']
well, i'm not playing with her. i'm out.:::['9-23-487']
i'll play you. okay.:::['9-23-488']
you don't know what you're doing. she gets crazy.:::['9-23-489']
this scar? that's from pictionary.:::['9-23-490']
i think i'll be all right.:::['9-23-491']
you want to volley a bit for serve? sure, if you want to.:::['9-23-492']
ho!:::['9-23-493']
oh, by the way, i'm awesome.:::['9-23-494']
oh, dear god, there's two of them.:::['9-23-495']
you ready to play? hell, yeah.:::['9-23-496']
did you know this about him? no idea. i thought he was soft like you.:::['9-23-497']
want to make it more interesting? how much you thinking?:::['9-23-498']
ten bucks a game? make it 50.:::['9-23-499']
i'll make it 100. one thousand...:::['9-23-500']
okay!:::['9-23-501']
we'll flip to see who goes first. you got a quarter?:::['9-23-502']
no. either of you girls got a quarter?:::['9-23-503']
honey, try to focus the trash talk on him.:::['9-23-504']
monica, you call it. heads. no, tails! heads!:::['9-23-505']
tails. oh, what are the chances?:::['9-23-506']
hah! my point! mike: oh, no, i don't think so.:::['9-23-507']
standard rules: if at any time a player uses his nonracket-bearing hand......to touch the playing surface,he or she forfeits the point.:::['9-23-508']
he was a lawyer.:::['9-23-509']
all the east coast is having beautiful weather.:::['9-23-510']
in new york, it's 72 and sunny.:::['9-23-511']
oh. weather bitch.:::['9-23-512']
it's open.:::['9-23-513']
hi, joe. hey.:::['9-23-514']
what? is everything okay? charlie and i broke up.:::['9-23-515']
well, she said we have nothing in common.:::['9-23-517']
that's crazy.:::['9-23-518', '4-11-153']
no, it's not. we have nothing in common.:::['9-23-519']
yeah, that's true. yeah.:::['9-23-520']
i mean, she should be with someone more like ross.:::['9-23-521']
you know, i mean he uses all those big words too.:::['9-23-522']
man, smart people are dull. well, hey!:::['9-23-523']
okay, rach.:::['9-23-524', '2-16-117']
i feel so stupid, you know? why do i keep going after the wrong girls?:::['9-23-525']
what are you talking about? oh, come on.:::['9-23-526']
i mean, there's you, then there's charlie. it's like... what the hell's my problem?:::['9-23-527']
i just...:::['9-23-528', '9-21-222', '4-2-76']
okay. maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl.:::['9-23-529']
i'm telling you, rach, charlie is not right for me.:::['9-23-530']
i'm not talking about her. well, then, who?:::['9-23-531']
the waitress i went out with last month?:::['9-23-532']
you know what? forget it. no, no, no, no.:::['9-23-533']
who are you talking about? no, i don't...:::['9-23-534']
i actually don't know who i'm talking about, so...:::['9-23-535']
okay. yeah.:::['9-23-536', '7-17-85', '3-21-315']
well, i'm gonna go see if i can get a room for tonight.:::['9-23-537']
and i'll see you later. yeah, sure. okay.:::['9-23-538']
you like me? okay.:::['9-23-539']
let's not make a big thing about this. it's a huge thing!:::['9-23-540']
okay, not working with me, joe.:::['9-23-541']
look, here's the thing. lately, i have been having thoughts.:::['9-23-542']
musings, if you will.:::['9-23-543']
well, for how long? oh, only like a month.:::['9-23-544']
a month?! well...:::['9-23-545']
dial it down. listen, maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes i do.:::['9-23-546']
i have been thinking about, you know, us.:::['9-23-547']
okay, dial it up a little. oh, you're right. okay.:::['9-23-548']
i just have a question. shoot.:::['9-23-549']
what the hell are you doing? i'm not trying to do anything.:::['9-23-550']
it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know?:::['9-23-551']
and i mean, aren't you just a little curious what it would be like?:::['9-23-552']
am i curious? i mean, i'm as curious as......george!:::['9-23-553']
curious george! oh!:::['9-23-555']
you know, the monkey and the guy with the yellow hat.:::['9-23-556']
of course. i remember. he had a paper route.:::['9-23-557']
yeah, he did.:::['9-23-558']
see, this is what i'm talking about. no, i know. we're great!:::['9-23-559']
but, rach, no, this can't happen.:::['9-23-560']
can't it just happen a little bit?:::['9-23-561']
no! it can't happen at all! why not?:::['9-23-562']
because, look, no one wants this to happen more than me, okay?:::['9-23-563']
i have gone over this moment in my head 100 times......and not once did i ever say no.:::['9-23-564']
i couldn't do it to ross.:::['9-23-565']
but that wasn't gonna stop you before. i know. i know......but i've thought about it a lot:::['9-23-566']
since then, and it just wouldn't be right.:::['9-23-567']
oh, god, i shouldn't have said anything. no, no, no, no. hey, we'll be fine.:::['9-23-570']
like you said, it's no big deal. it's not a big deal.:::['9-23-571']
no big deal. it's so not a big deal.:::['9-23-572']
i'll see you later. all right, hey. okay, great.:::['9-23-573']
rachel: okay... oh!:::['9-23-574']
oh, i'm sorry, i think... i think that may have missed the table.:::['9-23-575']
oh, do you? yeah.:::['9-23-576']
do you? yeah.:::['9-23-577']
do you? yeah!:::['9-23-578']
you really find this attractive on him? oh, yeah.:::['9-23-579']
are you telling me you're not even a little turned on by monica right now?:::['9-23-580']
this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.:::['9-23-581']
all right, come on, mike. you can beat her.:::['9-23-582']
knock that dog off her head.:::['9-23-583']
oh, damn it! i sleep with him!:::['9-23-584']
game point. don't get too cocky.:::['9-23-585']
remember, i won the last one.:::['9-23-586']
oh, by the way, how did that feel, losing to a girl?:::['9-23-587']
you should look in the mirror before you call yourself that.:::['9-23-588']
no! no! no! and that's how it's done.:::['9-23-589']
chandler: okey-dokey.:::['9-23-590']
you've each won a game, and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life.:::['9-23-591']
everybody goes home a winner.:::['9-23-592']
best of three? what i'm thinking.:::['9-23-593']
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?:::['9-23-594']
serve the ball, chump. "serve the ball, chump.":::['9-23-595']
okay, better comebacks, mike. better comebacks.:::['9-23-596']
i'm just saying, i have a cabin in the adirondacks.:::['9-23-597']
if you ever want to get away from the city, well, that'd be......just nifty.:::['9-23-598']
well, i've kind of got a lot on my plate right now.:::['9-23-599']
not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man.:::['9-23-600']
jarvis? oh, you're back.:::['9-23-601']
this is my wife, nancy. well, get out!:::['9-23-602']
ross? can i talk to you for a minute?:::['9-23-603']
yes, please.:::['9-23-604', '7-8-251', '10-11-37', '2-19-19']
so, what's going on?:::['9-23-605', '2-10-111']
well, joey and i broke up.:::['9-23-606']
oh, my god. what happened? joey is a great guy......but we're just...:::['9-23-607']
we're so different.:::['9-23-608']
i mean, like, during your speech, he kept laughing at "homo erectus.":::['9-23-609']
i knew that was him!:::['9-23-610']
anyway, i just... i think it's for the best.:::['9-23-611']
hey. hey, you okay? i guess.:::['9-23-612']
there was...:::['9-23-613']
there was another reason that i thought it was time to end it with joey.:::['9-23-614']
i started to realize that i was having feelings for someone else.:::['9-23-615']
okay, geller. last day of the conference.:::['9-23-616']
you know what happens to the keynote speaker.:::['9-23-617']
professor klarik, we're in the middle of a conversation here.:::['9-23-618']
can't you throw him in the pool later? or we could throw you both in now.:::['9-23-619']
okay, gentlemen, please. aren't we a little old for this?:::['9-23-620']
i mean, we're scientists, all right? we're academics......and most importantly:::['9-23-621']
you will have to catch us first.:::['9-23-622']
okay, so it's tied again, 41 to 41.:::['9-23-624']
okay, look, enough is enough. monica: no.:::['9-23-625']
i just have two more points to beat him. monica, that was also true an hour ago!:::['9-23-626']
i mean, please, look at you.:::['9-23-627']
your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable!:::['9-23-628']
you've already proven you're just as good as he is.:::['9-23-629']
we missed our dinner reservation, let's go upstairs......order room service, take a shower:::['9-23-630']
and shave your head!:::['9-23-631']
i can't just walk away. i've put in four hours.:::['9-23-632']
you knew this about me when you married me.:::['9-23-633']
you agreed to take me in sickness and in health.:::['9-23-634']
well, this is my sickness!:::['9-23-635']
what about the obsessive cleaning? that's just good sense.:::['9-23-636']
ow!:::['9-23-637', '7-6-188', '7-1-289', '7-13-17', '7-12-59', '10-7-193', '10-1-267', '10-1-287', '2-13-183', '5-8-294', '4-19-249', '4-23-224', '4-4-130', '3-8-30', '3-9-343', '3-21-259', '3-16-111']
you okay? no, honey, i'm okay.:::['9-23-638']
shake it off. oh, no shaking. no shaking. no shaking.:::['9-23-639']
oh, my god. i can't play.:::['9-23-640']
so you forfeit? mike wins?:::['9-23-641']
i can't believe it. i lost.:::['9-23-642']
no, you didn't. what?:::['9-23-643']
because i'm gonna play for you. you can't do that.:::['9-23-644']
it's okay. i don't care which of them i beat.:::['9-23-645']
okay, we're taking that paddle home, mister.:::['9-23-646']
honey, you don't have to do this. yes, i do.:::['9-23-647']
i may not understand why you have to win so badly......but if it's important to you,it's important to me.:::['9-23-648']
because i love you.:::['9-23-649']
but you suck.:::['9-23-650']
you're welcome, sweetheart.:::['9-23-651']
all right, let's get this over with. sudden death.:::['9-23-652']
whoever wins this point, wins. okay.:::['9-23-653']
oh, my god. you're good. it's like watching porn.:::['9-23-654']
and that's how it's done.:::['9-23-655', '3-7-190']
oh, my god. oh, my god. that was so amazing.:::['9-23-656']
well, when did you...?:::['9-23-657']
hold on, i almost forgot. loser.:::['9-23-658']
when did you stop sucking? i never sucked. i just didn't want you......to know how good i was.:::['9-23-659']
i don't know. well, this is so great.:::['9-23-661']
now we can enter doubles tournaments. that's why.:::['9-23-662']
they still looking for us? yeah.:::['9-23-663']
the bartender said they split up into two search parties.:::['9-23-664']
the herbivores and the carnivores.:::['9-23-665']
you know, we, as a group, are not the coolest.:::['9-23-666']
oh, look out.:::['9-23-667']
i don't think they saw us. i don't think they did.:::['9-23-668']
so i started to tell you something earlier. um...:::['9-23-669']
there was another reason that i realized it was time to end it with joey.:::['9-23-670']
i kind of realized i was starting to have feelings......for someone else.:::['9-23-671']
and can i ask who?:::['9-23-673']
i think you know.:::['9-23-674']
i think i know too, but i've been really wrong about this stuff in the past, so...:::['9-23-675']
i'm sorry, we can't. all right. all right.:::['9-23-676']
i mean, you just went out with my best friend, you know?:::['9-23-677']
i just think it would be a really, really bad idea.:::['9-23-678']
or not. i mean...:::['9-23-679']
oh, that feels so good.:::['9-22-0']
oh, lucky me. coffee and a live sex show.:::['9-22-1']
i'm sorry, what? i'm sorry.:::['9-22-2']
nothing. i was just reading to emma. from cosmo?:::['9-22-3']
yeah. yeah, it's, uh::::['9-22-4']
"climax your way to better skin.":::['9-22-5']
so i have to go shopping today, which is my least favorite thing.:::['9-22-6']
i'm so bad at picking out clothes.:::['9-22-7']
so you need someone who knows fashion to, uh, tell you what looks good.:::['9-22-8']
not me. not me. not me.:::['9-22-9']
oh, hey, rach? yeah?:::['9-22-10']
maybe you could take charlie shopping? oh, well...:::['9-22-11']
i'm sure you have better things to do. you kidding?:::['9-22-12']
rachel loves to shop, and she has great taste.:::['9-22-13']
she's the one that taught me not to wear white after labor day......and to always, always, always put:::['9-22-14']
on underwear when trying on clothes.:::['9-22-15']
if you have the time, i'd really appreciate the help.:::['9-22-16']
okay. yeah, let's shop.:::['9-22-17']
okay, you are gonna come back with some very classy clothes. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-22-18']
and some slutty lingerie. slutty!:::['9-22-19']
okay, great. all right, bye.:::['9-22-20']
pain in the ass!:::['9-22-21']
that's off, right? what's the matter, pheebs?:::['9-22-22']
ugh, mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight and he's gonna be there.:::['9-22-23']
she was like, "don't worry. i asked him and he's totally okay with seeing you.":::['9-22-24']
so now i have to go so he'll think that i'm totally okay with seeing him.:::['9-22-25']
you're not. you're hung up on him. exactly.:::['9-22-26']
you want him to eat his heart out, so you have to look fabulous.:::['9-22-27']
i didn't even think about that.:::['9-22-28']
ugh. sexual politics!:::['9-22-29']
pheebs, i'm taking charlie shopping.:::['9-22-30']
come and i'll help you find something. that'd be great.:::['9-22-31']
oh, isn't that nice? the three of you, trying on slutty lingerie together.:::['9-22-32']
that's not what we're gonna do. why'd you ruin it? who was i hurting?:::['9-22-33']
wow. fortunately, she has a very pretty face.:::['9-22-34']
i still can't believe this. my uterus is an inhospitable environment?:::['9-22-35']
i've always tried so hard to be a good hostess.:::['9-22-36']
i can't believe my sperm have low motility.:::['9-22-37']
while i was growing up, they sure seemed to be in a hurry to get places.:::['9-22-38']
connelly: hi there. hi.:::['9-22-39']
i'm sorry there wasn't better news from your tests last week......but i wanted to talk to you:::['9-22-40']
about your options.:::['9-22-41']
even though your chances of conceiving through natural means aren't great......you never know,so keep having sex on a regular basis.:::['9-22-43']
oh, damn it!:::['9-22-44']
don't worry. after a while, you'll tune it out.:::['9-22-45']
given your situation, the options with the greatest chances for success......would be surrogacy:::['9-22-46']
or insemination using a sperm donor.:::['9-22-47']
if you feel that neither of those is right for you, you could always adopt.:::['9-22-49']
is that a hint?:::['9-22-50']
because we love you, dr. connelly, but we don't want you to be our child.:::['9-22-51']
wow. talk about an inhospitable environment.:::['9-22-52']
hi. okay, you ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping?:::['9-22-53']
let's do it. all right, have a good time.:::['9-22-54']
not gonna find any clothes in there.:::['9-22-55']
hey, you guys. rachel: hi.:::['9-22-56']
guess who's up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference?:::['9-22-57']
uh, chris bailey? yeah, right.:::['9-22-58']
when was the last time he made a submission deadline for an abstract?:::['9-22-59']
why are you laughing?:::['9-22-60', '5-2-294', '3-13-181']
just seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist.:::['9-22-61']
it's fun. yeah.:::['9-22-62']
you're up for keynote speaker? yeah.:::['9-22-63']
who's deciding? professor sherman.:::['9-22-64']
i'm meeting with him today. he's a pretty tough guy to impress.:::['9-22-65']
i think i know how to dazzle him.:::['9-22-66']
oh, you're not gonna to do a magic trick, are you?:::['9-22-67']
pfft. no.:::['9-22-68']
hey, guys. i want to ask you something.:::['9-22-69']
i may get to speak at this paleontology convention.:::['9-22-70']
if i do, i'd love for you guys to come and hear me.:::['9-22-71']
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work and/or are sick.:::['9-22-72']
it's in barbados. but you come first.:::['9-22-73']
i'm there.:::['9-22-74']
we'll see you guys. joey: bye.:::['9-22-75']
rachel: see you. ross: hey.:::['9-22-76']
so how did it go at the fertility clinic? not as much fun as last time.:::['9-22-77']
apparently, you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.:::['9-22-78']
so, uh, what did the doctor say?:::['9-22-79']
there's surrogacy, but monica's dreamt her whole life of carrying a child......and she just felt that watching:::['9-22-80']
a surrogate would be too hard for her.:::['9-22-81']
so you're ruling out surrogacy? yeah.:::['9-22-82']
so i don't have to learn what that means?:::['9-22-83']
aside from adoption, the only other choice is insemination......so we're talking about sperm donors.:::['9-22-84']
enough said. i'm there for you, man. where is she, upstairs?:::['9-22-85']
how do you feel about all this?:::['9-22-86']
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child, but there isn't one.:::['9-22-87']
come on, ross, be a good guy. step up and do it.:::['9-22-88']
what? no! i'm not gonna give them ben!:::['9-22-90']
the data we're receiving from mri scans and dna testing......of these fossils are staggering.:::['9-22-91']
i mean, we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given.:::['9-22-93']
but if they're off by even a 100,000 years or so......then you can just throw:::['9-22-94']
most of our assumptions......you know, right in the trash.:::['9-22-95']
so, what i'm saying is...:::['9-22-96']
is that...:::['9-22-97']
is that, uh, repercussions could be huge.:::['9-22-98']
i mean, not just in paleontology, but if you think about it......in evolutionary biology,uh genetics, uh, geology.:::['9-22-99']
i mean, truly, the mind boggles.:::['9-22-100']
well, that's not what you want.:::['9-22-101']
incentive for men? i'll take some of that.:::['9-22-102']
that's for men. phoebe: i know.:::['9-22-103']
when i go to the party later......mike will know i'm over him:::['9-22-104']
because i'll smell like another guy.:::['9-22-105']
oh, good, i'm dating a russian cabdriver.:::['9-22-108']
seriously, does anyone buy this? i smell like beets.:::['9-22-109']
i really like those jackets with the shoulder pads in them. where are those?:::['9-22-110']
um, on melanie griffith in working girl.:::['9-22-111']
um, i think what you want is over here.:::['9-22-112']
see, i told you i needed someone.:::['9-22-113']
by the way, as a thank you, i would really love to take you out.:::['9-22-114']
really? joey and i are going to a movie tonight.:::['9-22-115']
you want to come? oh, i can't.:::['9-22-116']
because i've seen them.:::['9-22-117']
you've seen all the movies?:::['9-22-118']
yeah. i'm a big fan.:::['9-22-119']
of the movies.:::['9-22-120']
you know, motion pictures.:::['9-22-121']
the talkies.:::['9-22-122']
rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?:::['9-22-123']
rachel: sure. okay.:::['9-22-124']
maybe we could do something else.:::['9-22-125']
you know, that depends on what it is. i've done a lot of stuff.:::['9-22-126']
so, what were you doing out there? do you not like charlie?:::['9-22-127']
she's okay. i don't know, i just don't get a really good vibe from her.:::['9-22-128']
why? i don't know.:::['9-22-129', '9-6-417', '4-19-197', '4-23-257']
you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart......and tall, you know......and just swept joey off his feet.:::['9-22-130']
nobody else has a chance.:::['9-22-131']
who else? anybody.:::['9-22-132']
you. me.:::['9-22-133']
you know, monica's mom.:::['9-22-134']
you like joey? shh! phoebe!:::['9-22-135']
all right, look, i do. i have a little thing for him. just...:::['9-22-136']
oh, my god. it's just physical.:::['9-22-137']
i have it totally under control, okay? it's just when i see them together......sometimes, i just get a little jealous.:::['9-22-138']
wow. isn't that ironic that he liked you, and now you like...?:::['9-22-139']
i get it!:::['9-22-140', '5-1-298']
all right, as long as it's under control.:::['9-22-141']
you can't do anything about it. he's already dating her.:::['9-22-142']
she is a nice person. that wouldn't be right.:::['9-22-143']
i know, i know. so it's just not a big deal.:::['9-22-144']
so can we keep this between us? sure.:::['9-22-145']
great, because i gotta get out of here. the smell of beets is killing me.:::['9-22-146']
any chance charlie has a deaf twin? mm.:::['9-22-147']
hi, honey. chandler: hey.:::['9-22-148']
i brought a friend home for dinner. this is zack from work.:::['9-22-149']
oh, of course. it's so nice to see you again, zack.:::['9-22-150']
you too. you guys haven't actually met before.:::['9-22-151']
but, boy, you're both polite.:::['9-22-152']
have a seat. i'll get you a beer.:::['9-22-153']
monica: i got it. zack: thanks.:::['9-22-154']
so zack's pretty nice, huh? yeah, i guess.:::['9-22-155']
so how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his?:::['9-22-156']
we're talking about sperm donors, and zack may be the guy.:::['9-22-158']
look. he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic. i mean, he's sperm-tastic!:::['9-22-159']
chandler, this is crazy. well, what did you even say to him?:::['9-22-160']
"come up. meet my wife. give us your sperm.":::['9-22-161']
i invited him to dinner so you'd get a chance to get to know him.:::['9-22-162']
with a sperm bank, you never meet the guy, get to check him out.:::['9-22-163']
chandler! i'm telling you, he's great.:::['9-22-164']
i mean, even if my sperm worked fine, i think he'd be the way to go.:::['9-22-165']
i'm not going to be a part of this.:::['9-22-166']
you can't bring some random guy home and expect him to be our sperm donor.:::['9-22-167']
zack? zack: thanks.:::['9-22-169']
do you have a coaster? i don't want to make a ring.:::['9-22-170']
tell me about yourself, zack.:::['9-22-171']
oh, god, do you think she heard? it'd be so bad if she heard.:::['9-22-172']
maybe she didn't hear. i'll go into that dressing room and talk. you stay here.:::['9-22-173']
see if you can hear me. okay, great.:::['9-22-174']
rachel: oh, thank god, i can't hear a word that you're saying.:::['9-22-175']
i didn't say anything yet. well, get back in there and talk.:::['9-22-176']
phoebe: i'm rachel.:::['9-22-177']
it's so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends.:::['9-22-178']
well, some things are just hard to say to your face.:::['9-22-180']
okay, well, i heard that. which means that she heard it too.:::['9-22-181']
we have a problem. oh, what are we gonna do?:::['9-22-182']
just be honest with her.:::['9-22-183']
it is annoying when parents put babies on the phone.:::['9-22-185']
all right, enough out of you!:::['9-22-186']
hello? i need to talk to charlie. is she there?:::['9-22-187']
no, she, uh, went shopping with rachel. why? what's up?:::['9-22-188']
i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker.:::['9-22-189']
how's it going? it could be better.:::['9-22-190']
he, um... he fell asleep.:::['9-22-191']
what? but i already bought my ticket to bermuda!:::['9-22-192']
barbados. fine, i'll rent a car and drive.:::['9-22-193']
you have to get that job.:::['9-22-194']
what am i supposed to do? he's out cold.:::['9-22-195']
in fact, he was just talking in his sleep before......and evidently he wants someone:::['9-22-196']
named fran to "spank him harder.":::['9-22-197']
well, just wake him up. i can't.:::['9-22-198']
if he realizes that i'm the one who put him to sleep, i won't get the job.:::['9-22-199']
joey: ooh, that's a tough one.:::['9-22-200']
oh, wait a minute. this happened to me before.:::['9-22-201']
yeah, i was auditioning for a play, and the producer fell asleep. i...:::['9-22-202']
no, wait a minute.:::['9-22-203']
it was me who fell asleep.:::['9-22-204']
i mean, hey, shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while?:::['9-22-205']
hey, guys, dinner's ready. i'm gonna go wash up first.:::['9-22-206']
what do you think? i want his genes for my kid. those eyes, those cheekbones.:::['9-22-208']
okay, there's enthusiastic, and there's just plain gay.:::['9-22-209']
you don't like him. i think he's fine.:::['9-22-210']
but we don't know anything real about him.:::['9-22-211']
i wish we could get more information. all right, just follow my lead.:::['9-22-212']
you guys have a great place here. thanks. i'm crazy about our place.:::['9-22-213']
hey, speaking of crazy......do you have a history:::['9-22-214']
of mental illness in the family?:::['9-22-215']
uh, no. although, i did have an uncle who voted for dukakis.:::['9-22-216']
that's really not the kind of thing we're looking for.:::['9-22-217']
so, um, tell me, how'd you guys meet?:::['9-22-219']
oh, friends first, drunk in london, you know the story.:::['9-22-220']
i've got a better question for you::::['9-22-221']
do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?:::['9-22-222']
uh, heart disease? alzheimer's? gout?:::['9-22-224']
you guys don't have people for dinner a lot, huh?:::['9-22-225']
we're just making conversation.:::['9-22-226']
yeah, well, okay. i heard a joke today. it's pretty funny.:::['9-22-227']
you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness.:::['9-22-228']
you guys have shown a lot of interest in me tonight, and i'm flattered......and quite frankly, a little frightened.:::['9-22-229']
can we just talk about something else?:::['9-22-230']
sure. chandler: all right.:::['9-22-231']
this ravioli's delicious.:::['9-22-232']
i notice you're enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth.:::['9-22-233']
did you have braces as a child?:::['9-22-234']
no, i didn't. yes!:::['9-22-235']
we're teeth people, zack.:::['9-22-236']
let's just do it. let's just go over there and see if she heard.:::['9-22-237']
good plan. okay.:::['9-22-238']
what? where are you going? oh, i'm sorry, rachel.:::['9-22-239']
i don't have time for your childish games, okay?:::['9-22-240']
i still have to find something incredible to wear......so i can beat mike:::['9-22-241']
at "who's more over who"!:::['9-22-242']
hey. hi. hey.:::['9-22-243']
where have you been? trying on clothes.:::['9-22-244']
oh, really? in the dressing room? well, that's so weird.:::['9-22-245']
phoebe and i were in the dressing room. gosh, it's just such a small world.:::['9-22-246']
rachel, i heard you two guys whispering.:::['9-22-247']
oh, god, you did, you heard. okay, look, let me explain.:::['9-22-248']
there's nothing to explain. i heard you.:::['9-22-249']
phoebe likes joey.:::['9-22-250']
i don't understand it. i mean, phoebe likes joey......and then she's here to buy a dress:::['9-22-252']
to impress another guy?:::['9-22-253']
yeah, that's phoebe. that's phoebe. you know, she just wants them all.:::['9-22-254']
it's, like, she's nympho.:::['9-22-255']
wow! yeah.:::['9-22-256']
you know, by the way, i heard you tell her not to do anything.:::['9-22-257']
thanks for sticking up for me. god, you are such a nice person.:::['9-22-258']
i try.:::['9-22-259']
oh, my god, you really want me to be the keynote speaker?:::['9-22-261']
thank you!:::['9-22-262', '7-3-177', '2-11-44', '2-6-156', '2-20-154', '5-4-271', '5-17-193', '4-11-328']
wow! you look......stop-eating hot!:::['9-22-264']
which is like the highest level of hotness.:::['9-22-265']
okay, are you sure? because i am really dreading going to this party.:::['9-22-266']
then don't go.:::['9-22-267']
mike knows i'm coming. if i don't show up, he'll think it's because of him......and then i'm gonna lose face.:::['9-22-268']
that's a very serious thing in my culture.:::['9-22-269']
all right, then you go to that party, and you pretend to be over mike.:::['9-22-270']
afterward, you come to my place and i'll get you good and drunk.:::['9-22-271']
you got it. okay.:::['9-22-272']
but not on the wine that you made, okay?:::['9-22-273']
because i just don't want to go back to the emergency room.:::['9-22-274']
phoebe: david? phoebe! hi.:::['9-22-275']
phoebe: oh, my god! hi.:::['9-22-276']
wow! you look unbelievable.:::['9-22-277']
oh, yeah, well...:::['9-22-278']
well, i'm back from minsk. uh, permanently.:::['9-22-280']
remember how i was trying to achieve......the positronic distillation:::['9-22-282']
of subatomic particles?:::['9-22-283']
well, after eight years of research, i discovered......that it can't be done.:::['9-22-285']
well......great that you're back. how are you?:::['9-22-286']
good. good. life is good. good.:::['9-22-287']
well, i'm seeing someone. oh.:::['9-22-288']
good for you. yeah.:::['9-22-289']
she's also a scientist, so she's very smart and pretty and, um...:::['9-22-290']
it's actually because of you that we're together.:::['9-22-291']
i mean, i saw what you had with that mike guy......and i just said, "boy, i want that.":::['9-22-292']
mike and i broke up. you're kidding me.:::['9-22-293']
because i'm not seeing anybody. i just totally made that up.:::['9-22-294']
really? i don't know why, i'm sorry.:::['9-22-295']
i guess i just didn't want to lose face.:::['9-22-296']
yeah. okay. so then, okay...:::['9-22-298']
so we're both living in new york, not seeing anyone.:::['9-22-299']
that's so not like us. yeah, i know.:::['9-22-300']
well, this is probably a stupid question, seeing that you look like that......but, um, do you have someplace:::['9-22-301']
that you need to be right now?:::['9-22-302']
well, do you want to get a drink? i'd love to.:::['9-22-305']
great. okay.:::['9-22-306']
uh, do you smell beets?:::['9-22-307']
oh, all right, stay upwind of me.:::['9-22-308']
hey, there's phoebe. is that mike she's with?:::['9-22-309']
no, that's david.:::['9-22-310']
there's a third guy?:::['9-22-311']
tip of the iceberg.:::['9-22-312']
i'm gonna take off now.:::['9-22-313']
you're gonna let me go home, aren't you?:::['9-22-314']
sure you don't want to stay a little longer?:::['9-22-315']
no, i should get home. i'm kind of tired.:::['9-22-316']
are you always tired?:::['9-22-317']
because that could be a sign of clinical depression.:::['9-22-318']
no, it's tiring to figure out the age at which all my grandparents died.:::['9-22-319']
i'll see you tomorrow. okay.:::['9-22-320', '9-12-261', '7-20-30', '5-11-67']
i think we found our sperm.:::['9-22-322']
he does seem pretty perfect.:::['9-22-323']
yeah? you think so? should i ask him?:::['9-22-324']
why not? just because his great-grandmother was obese?:::['9-22-326']
our kid's gonna get that from you anyway.:::['9-22-327']
no, that's not it.:::['9-22-328', '3-19-57']
it's just that when we were asking him all those questions before......i just realized i don't care if he:::['9-22-329']
is the most perfect guy in the world.:::['9-22-330']
he's not you. yeah, he's better!:::['9-22-331']
no, he's not.:::['9-22-332']
if i can't get pregnant with you, then i don't want to get pregnant by him......or anyone else.:::['9-22-333']
really? are you sure? yeah, i'm sure.:::['9-22-334']
thank god, because i don't wanna do this either.:::['9-22-335']
i was just doing it because i thought that was what you wanted.:::['9-22-336']
i'm the husband. i'm supposed to bring the sperm.:::['9-22-337']
that is so sweet.:::['9-22-338', '10-9-271', '5-21-32', '5-21-171']
so you know this leaves us with...:::['9-22-340']
adoption.:::['9-22-341']
how do you feel about that?:::['9-22-342']
i think i feel okay about it.:::['9-22-343']
actually, i think i feel really good about it.:::['9-22-344']
i wanna find a baby that needs a home, and i wanna raise it with you.:::['9-22-346']
and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.:::['9-22-347']
so this is it? we're really gonna adopt?:::['9-22-348']
oh, my god! we're gonna be parents! we are gonna be great parents.:::['9-22-350']
and it could be soon.:::['9-22-351']
i mean, think about it. right now, somewhere out there......our baby could be being conceived.:::['9-22-352']
wait. if we're lucky, and we're really, really, really quiet......we may be able to hear:::['9-22-353']
the sound of a condom breaking.:::['9-22-354']
hey, zack.:::['9-22-355']
i wanted to apologize for last night.:::['9-22-357']
i got the feeling we made you uncomfortable.:::['9-22-358']
no, you didn't. really?:::['9-22-359']
no, you did.:::['9-22-360']
my wife and i have some boundary issues.:::['9-22-361']
sometimes we ask inappropriate questions.:::['9-22-362']
we're working on it.:::['9-22-363']
here are the boards for friday's pitch. thank you.:::['9-22-364']
you wouldn't know if she's planning on keeping her baby, would you?:::['9-22-365']
hey, you guys? what are you doing tomorrow night?:::['9-20-0']
oh, well, let me see. i believe i'm...:::['9-20-1']
yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.:::['9-20-2']
well, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.:::['9-20-3']
i could fall asleep at a play.:::['9-20-4']
what is it? it's a one-woman play called::::['9-20-5']
why don '2' you like me? a bitter woman's journey through life.:::['9-20-6']
phoebe: ooh.:::['9-20-7']
that sounds interesting. that does sound interesting.:::['9-20-8']
to listen to a woman complain for two hours. i don't think it gets bet--:::['9-20-9']
i know! i know. we can drive. we can vote. we can work.:::['9-20-10']
what more do these broads want?:::['9-20-11']
well, you guys will have a great time. i promise.:::['9-20-12']
what? how come you don't have to go?:::['9-20-13']
i wish i could, but i found out......that i have to be at work really:::['9-20-14']
early the next day, so i can't go.:::['9-20-15']
but take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.:::['9-20-16']
ooh. let's see. who do i hate?:::['9-20-17']
oops, sorry. okay.:::['9-20-19']
okay. okay. up you 90-:::['9-20-20']
rachel: oh, gosh, okay! all right.:::['9-20-21']
do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around......and not have it be a big deal?:::['9-20-23']
no, i don't think that ever works. why?:::['9-20-24']
no reason. no, no. rachel?:::['9-20-25']
yeah. who do you want to fool around with? nobody! forget it.:::['9-20-26']
you can't. why?:::['9-20-29']
because.:::['9-20-30', '10-9-239']
did not understand a word you just said.:::['9-20-31']
in the hall. okay.:::['9-20-32']
you wanna fool around with joey? yeah.:::['9-20-33']
ever since i had that dream about him, i can't get it out of my head.:::['9-20-34']
i mean, what's the big deal? people do it all the time.:::['9-20-35']
who do you know that are friends that just fool around?:::['9-20-36']
okay. off the top of my head... don and janet.:::['9-20-37']
who are they? i know them from work.:::['9-20-38']
both of them? no, just one of them.:::['9-20-39']
i don't know. what were the names i just said?:::['9-20-41']
no, rachel, things could get incredibly complicated.:::['9-20-42']
you're right. i won't do anything with joey. i just thought it--:::['9-20-43']
okay, so that's two cups of tarragon, a pound of baking soda and a red onion?:::['9-20-44']
what the hell are you cooking?:::['9-20-45']
you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today.:::['9-20-47']
yes, but, ross, you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.:::['9-20-48']
there are these two professors who are joining my department......and i have to meet them here:::['9-20-49']
and show them around campus.:::['9-20-50']
what's bad about that?:::['9-20-51']
i just know they'll be a couple of old windbags......wearing tweed jackets:::['9-20-52']
with suede elbow patches.:::['9-20-53']
what? these aren't suede.:::['9-20-55']
excuse me. i'm looking for someone.:::['9-20-56']
you don't, by any chance, know a ross geller?:::['9-20-57']
hi. hi, i'm ross geller.:::['9-20-59']
oh, hi. i'm professor wheeler. oh.:::['9-20-60']
oh, that's-- that's-- that's nice.:::['9-20-61']
it's good to meet you.:::['9-20-62']
thank you so much for taking the time to show me around.:::['9-20-63']
no, it's no big deal.:::['9-20-64']
if i weren't doing this, i'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.:::['9-20-65']
is he gonna introduce us?:::['9-20-66']
i think we're just blurry shapes to him now.:::['9-20-67']
by the way, i really enjoyed your paper......on the connection between geographic:::['9-20-68']
isolation and rapid mutagenesis.:::['9-20-69']
i wrote that in one night.:::['9-20-70']
twenty bucks says they're married within the month.:::['9-20-71']
well, we should probably get going.:::['9-20-72']
we've got a lot of ground to cover.:::['9-20-73']
isn't another professor supposed to come with us?:::['9-20-74']
i'm pretty sure. a professor spafford from cornell?:::['9-20-76']
well, he's obviously late, and the rule in my class is::::['9-20-77']
if you can't come on time, then don't come at all.:::['9-20-78']
an option that many of my students use.:::['9-20-79']
shall we? we shouldn't wait for him?:::['9-20-80']
you know what, he's a big boy. i'm sure he'll find us, okay?:::['9-20-81']
professor geller? oh, damn it!:::['9-20-82']
can't wait for your party tonight.:::['9-20-83']
listen, i forgot your address. can you give me a call? thanks. bye.:::['9-20-84']
hey! hey!:::['9-20-85', '10-5-347', '10-13-27', '4-5-44', '4-5-198']
what's happening?:::['9-20-86']
it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.:::['9-20-87']
i'd love to, but i gotta get up so early the next day.:::['9-20-88']
you know me, work comes first. oh, yeah, yeah.:::['9-20-89']
jan: hi, it's jan rogers. can't wait for your party tonight.:::['9-20-90']
stupid jan rogers!:::['9-20-91']
you are having a party tonight?:::['9-20-92']
i'm kind of having a thing for the days of our lives people.:::['9-20-93']
you weren't gonna tell us?:::['9-20-94']
how did you think you'd get away with that?:::['9-20-95']
i do it every year.:::['9-20-96']
you do that every year?!:::['9-20-97']
i didn't have to tell you that!:::['9-20-98']
god, i'm stupider than jan rogers!:::['9-20-99']
that's why you got us tickets to that play, to get rid of us!:::['9-20-100']
last year is that why you sent us to that medieval times restaurant?:::['9-20-102']
the year before that, you set up that nighttime tour of that button factory?:::['9-20-104']
i can't believe you guys went for that one.:::['9-20-105']
why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?:::['9-20-106']
you're fine, okay? but everyone else acts like an idiot around famous people.:::['9-20-107']
well, then, so just invite me.:::['9-20-108']
please, i was trying to be nice. you're the worst one.:::['9-20-109']
joey, come on! please, please? let me come. i will behave. i promise.:::['9-20-110']
i will behave. please, please, please. okay, fine. you can come.:::['9-20-111']
but don't tell anybody else. it's up on the roof at 8.:::['9-20-112']
a soap-opera roof party?!:::['9-20-113']
i'm going to a soap-opera roof party! uh, my god! oh, my god!:::['9-20-114']
and it's out of my system.:::['9-20-115']
and then my wife and i went on a cruise to the galépagos.:::['9-20-116']
there was a seafood buffet you wouldn't believe.:::['9-20-117']
there were clams and mussels and oysters......and cracked crab......and snow crab......and king crab.:::['9-20-118']
it's a pity i'm allergic to shellfish.:::['9-20-119']
so where did you get your undergraduate degree?:::['9-20-120']
and that's not all i'm allergic to. oh, it's not over.:::['9-20-121']
i'm also allergic to peanuts and cashews......and almonds and filberts--:::['9-20-122']
so basically all nuts!:::['9-20-123']
interestingly, no.:::['9-20-124']
you're kind of playing it fast and loose with the word "interesting.":::['9-20-125']
if you'll excuse me, i'm going to use the restroom.:::['9-20-126']
i've lost the will to live.:::['9-20-128']
let's ditch him. what?:::['9-20-129']
while he's still in the bathroom. i am begging you.:::['9-20-130']
okay. okay, fine, but i just have one question for you.:::['9-20-131']
when we exit, should we walk or run......or prance or stroll--?:::['9-20-132']
stop it! stop it! he talks slow, but he might pee fast. okay, let's move!:::['9-20-133']
oh, hey, you guys, this is charlie.:::['9-20-134']
charlie, this is phoebe and my sister, monica.:::['9-20-135']
phoebe & monica: hi. charlie will be joining my department.:::['9-20-136']
you're a paleontologist too? yeah.:::['9-20-137']
oh, okay. now, what do you think......of renyard's new theory of species:::['9-20-138']
variegation in segmented arthropods?:::['9-20-139']
i think he's a little out there, but he does have some interesting ideas.:::['9-20-140']
oh, i'm sorry. i have to take this. excuse me.:::['9-20-141']
renyard's theory of species variegation?:::['9-20-142']
i saw the article on your coffee table. i memorized the title to freak you out.:::['9-20-143']
so did you two have fun?:::['9-20-144']
oh, my god. she's great.:::['9-20-145']
we have so much in common, and she's just cool, you know? and funny.:::['9-20-146']
and i don't know if you've noticed, but she's a hottie!:::['9-20-147']
hey. phoebe: hey. hi, you guys. listen, you know what, i'm not feeling really well......and i don't think i'm gonna get:::['9-20-149']
to go to the play.:::['9-20-150']
really? what's wrong?:::['9-20-151']
i don't know. i think it's kind of serious.:::['9-20-152']
you know, i was watching this thing on tv this morning......about newcastle disease,and i think i might have it.:::['9-20-153']
newcastle disease is a secretion-borne virus......that only affects chickens:::['9-20-154']
and other poultry.:::['9-20-155']
okay, who's this?:::['9-20-156']
i'm sorry. rachel, this is charlie wheeler. she's a colleague.:::['9-20-157']
hi. well, i would shake your hand......but i'm sure you don't want:::['9-20-158']
to get my chicken disease.:::['9-20-159']
rachel, can i see you for a second? rachel: sure.:::['9-20-160']
you're not sick.:::['9-20-161']
what? yes, i am!:::['9-20-162']
okay, then why are you all dressed up?:::['9-20-163']
when you're sick, you do whatever you can to make yourself feel better.:::['9-20-164']
you just want to stay home so you can make a move on joey.:::['9-20-165']
no, i heard you before. that is so not what this is.:::['9-20-166']
okay, then what is this?:::['9-20-167']
joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof.:::['9-20-169']
and he sent you guys to the play to get rid of you.:::['9-20-170']
what? what's going on?:::['9-20-172']
joey is having a secret days of our lives party up on the roof!:::['9-20-173']
he didn't want you to know about it, but i came over here to tell you.:::['9-20-174']
you came to say you were sick. all right, professor or detective?:::['9-20-175']
wait, joey's having a party, and he wasn't gonna invite us?:::['9-20-176']
he does it every year. that's why he's sending you to the play.:::['9-20-177']
that's why he sent us to that medieval restaurant and to that button factory.:::['9-20-178']
and that horrible museum tour?:::['9-20-179']
no, i arranged that.:::['9-20-180']
hey, you guys, i'm turning in. have fun.:::['9-20-181']
we know about your party, joey.:::['9-20-182']
what party? the game's over. take off your robe.:::['9-20-183']
okay, i mean...:::['9-20-184']
close it up! close it up!:::['9-20-186']
nice to meet you.:::['9-20-187', '5-3-201']
joey: hey, you made it! all right!:::['9-20-188']
glad you could make it. thanks for coming.:::['9-20-189']
oh, my god. kyle lowder! hi.:::['9-20-190']
hey. that's why i didn't invite you. you have to calm down, all right?:::['9-20-192']
just get yourself a drink or something.:::['9-20-193']
oh, yeah, that's what you want. my inhibitions lowered.:::['9-20-194']
phoebe: hey.:::['9-20-195', '2-15-36', '4-15-228']
my god, can you believe we're surrounded by all this?:::['9-20-196']
i can barely control myself.:::['9-20-197']
you might want to remember that you're married.:::['9-20-198']
where is chandler anyway?:::['9-20-199']
oh, my god! chandler!:::['9-20-200']
where the hell is everybody?:::['9-20-201']
why don '2' you like me?:::['9-20-202', '9-20-364']
chapter 1: my first period.:::['9-20-203', '9-20-365']
hey, joey said no autographs.:::['9-20-204']
but if she's getting one, i want one too!:::['9-20-205']
"to monica." and none of this "best wishes" crap. i want "love.":::['9-20-206']
okay, actually, mon, matthew was giving me his phone number.:::['9-20-207']
oh, man! lfl had known i was coming to this party......i never would've gotten married!:::['9-20-208']
it was nice to meet you. nice to meet you.:::['9-20-209']
call me. we will!:::['9-20-210']
look at you with all the guys! yeah. i guess you've forgotten joey.:::['9-20-211']
yeah, well, i guess i have forgotten aboutjoey.:::['9-20-212']
and clearly, you've forgotten about chandler.:::['9-20-213']
please. chandler's the love of my life.:::['9-20-214']
oh, leather pants! have mercy!:::['9-20-215']
so it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston, huh?:::['9-20-216']
actually, i'm kind of happy to be leaving. i just broke up with someone.:::['9-20-217']
oh, so sad.:::['9-20-218']
still, it can't be easy for you to leave harvard.:::['9-20-219']
especially after working with a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer.:::['9-20-220']
actually, albie is the guy i broke up with.:::['9-20-221']
you dated albert wintermeyer? yeah.:::['9-20-222']
and you called him "albie"?:::['9-20-223']
i mean, that's like calling albert einstein...:::['9-20-224']
albie.:::['9-20-225']
yeah, well, he is a brilliant man.:::['9-20-226']
you think? i mean, you dated the guy......who improved the accuracy:::['9-20-227']
of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!:::['9-20-228']
yes, and while that is everything one looks for in a boyfriend......he had a lot of issues.:::['9-20-229']
oh, like what?:::['9-20-230']
i'm sorry. i don't mean to pry. it's just that this must be......what regular people experience:::['9-20-231']
when they watch access hollywood.:::['9-20-232']
okay, you want the dirt?:::['9-20-233']
albie was seriously insecure.:::['9-20-234']
he was really intimidated by the guy i dated before him.:::['9-20-235']
who's intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize?:::['9-20-236']
a guy who won two.:::['9-20-237']
two? what--?:::['9-20-238']
don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart?:::['9-20-239']
yeah, for three years.:::['9-20-240']
have you ever dated someone who hasn't won the nobel prize?:::['9-20-242']
but there was my first boyfriend, billy.:::['9-20-244']
oh, yeah? no nobel prizes for him?:::['9-20-245']
no, but he did just win a macarthur "genius grant.":::['9-20-246']
what a loser.:::['9-20-247']
some more wine?:::['9-20-248']
hey, ross. how's it going with charlie?:::['9-20-249']
oh, great. after i finish my wine......i'm gonna blow:::['9-20-250']
my average-sized brains out.:::['9-20-251']
she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners.:::['9-20-253']
oh, my god, at the chinese restaurant earlier today......i put chopsticks in my mouth:::['9-20-254']
and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.:::['9-20-255']
i always loved that.:::['9-20-256']
of course you would! your brains are smaller than mine!:::['9-20-257']
i can't compete with the guys she goes out with.:::['9-20-258']
they're so out of my league.:::['9-20-259']
worse? oh, much, much worse.:::['9-20-261']
i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians.:::['9-20-262']
"can we walk?":::['9-20-263']
oh, you like that? no.:::['9-20-264']
come on! i think that's funny!:::['9-20-266']
woolly mammoth.:::['9-20-267']
l'i's good!:::['9-20-268']
i bet you're thinking that now would be a great time for an intermission, huh?:::['9-20-269']
oh, yes. god, yes.:::['9-20-270']
well, you're not gonna get one!:::['9-20-271']
because in life, there are no intermissions, people!:::['9-20-272']
now, chapter 7: divorce is a four-letter word!:::['9-20-273']
how could he leave me?!:::['9-20-274']
i don't know. you seem lovely.:::['9-20-275']
ross, this is one of my costars, dirk. dirk, this is my good friend ross.:::['9-20-276']
nice to meet you. so, what show are you on?:::['9-20-277']
i'm not an actor. i'm a professor of paleontology.:::['9-20-278']
that's science. oh.:::['9-20-279']
hey, well, listen, i play a scientist on days.:::['9-20-280']
yeah, my character just won a nobel prize.:::['9-20-281']
dirk was wondering about the woman you brought and if you two are together?:::['9-20-282']
oh. well, no, but...:::['9-20-283']
i mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.:::['9-20-284']
hey, i got a 690 on my sats.:::['9-20-285']
i'd lead with that.:::['9-20-286']
that's it. just sign right on the bra.:::['9-20-287']
joey: monica!:::['9-20-288']
don't worry, joe. i won't come next year!:::['9-20-289']
what the--?:::['9-20-290']
what do you got there?:::['9-20-291']
just some boys gave me their phone numbers.:::['9-20-292']
oh, really? let me see. oh.:::['9-20-293']
damn, that's a lot of guys.:::['9-20-294']
are you a little slutty?:::['9-20-295']
i think i am.:::['9-20-296']
let me see if i approve of any of these clowns.:::['9-20-297']
this guy wears a rug. well...:::['9-20-298']
this guy's canadian.:::['9-20-299']
oh, and this guy is in a cult, okay?:::['9-20-300']
it'll cost you $5000 to get to level three, and i don't feel any different.:::['9-20-301']
pass. pa-- oh, pass. pass.:::['9-20-302']
why? what's wrong with these guys? well, nothing major.:::['9-20-303']
it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you......and you deserve the best.:::['9-20-304']
joey, you're so sweet.:::['9-20-305']
it's true, but it doesn't matter. i already know who you're going home with.:::['9-20-306']
yeah, because we live together. it's a joke! it's a joke.:::['9-20-311']
right! that's funny! i get it!:::['9-20-312']
got you! you're funny, joey.:::['9-20-313']
so how did you enjoy the play?:::['9-20-315']
oh, my god. honey, i am so, so, so, so sorry.:::['9-20-316']
you should be.:::['9-20-317']
you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.:::['9-20-318']
you really liked it? oh, yeah. i mean, at first i hated it.:::['9-20-319']
but why wouldn't i? because as a man, i've been trained not to listen!:::['9-20-320']
but after chapter 16: fat, single and ready to mingle......i was uplifted.:::['9-20-321']
oh, really? oh, yeah.:::['9-20-322']
i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman.:::['9-20-323']
tell me-- tell me about your first period.:::['9-20-324']
did somebody sign your bra?:::['9-20-326']
so i got it when i was 13. very difficult.:::['9-20-327']
hey, ross? so listen, about you and the dinosaur girl?:::['9-20-328']
are you really just gonna let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off?:::['9-20-329']
what is that? come on, a piece of paper?:::['9-20-330']
it's actually a million-dollar prize.:::['9-20-331']
go, charlie!:::['9-20-332']
but my point is......okay, so she dated them,but she also broke up with them.:::['9-20-333']
maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average joe ph.d.:::['9-20-334']
yeah, maybe, and i do have my whole career in front of me.:::['9-20-335']
i mean...:::['9-20-336', '10-16-108', '2-8-145', '5-2-297', '4-11-200']
i could still win a nobel prize.:::['9-20-337']
although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited.:::['9-20-338']
you're so much more than just brains. you are sweet and kind and funny.:::['9-20-339']
and sexy.:::['9-20-340']
okay, well, give her a chance to see all that.:::['9-20-341']
yeah. yeah. you're right.:::['9-20-342']
thanks. i'm gonna go find her. good for you.:::['9-20-343']
your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was topnotch.:::['9-20-344']
stop going through my stuff!:::['9-20-345']
i just wanted to let you know i've changed my mind.:::['9-20-347']
i'm gonna do it. i'm gonna kiss joey.:::['9-20-348']
no! you can't! friends hooking up is a bad idea.:::['9-20-349']
please! what about you and chandler?:::['9-20-350']
that's different. i was drunk and stupid.:::['9-20-351']
well, hello?:::['9-20-352']
what about all the guys that you got the phone numbers from?:::['9-20-353']
why don't you just kiss one of them. i could......but i don't want to.:::['9-20-354']
i want to kiss joey.:::['9-20-355']
all right. i think it's a big mistake, but it's your decision.:::['9-20-356']
i'm gonna do it.:::['9-20-357']
and i can't stop you? no.:::['9-20-358']
hey, rach, have you seen charlie anywhere?:::['9-20-359']
i'm smarter than him!:::['9-20-360']
hey, thank you so much for these tickets, chandler.:::['9-20-361']
this was a really important experience for me. i wanted to share it with you.:::['9-20-362']
you're so wonderful.:::['9-20-363']
i can't believe you guys bought that. enjoy your slow death.:::['9-20-366']
it's so weird. how did joey end up kissing charlie last night?:::['9-21-0']
i thought you'd end up kissing charlie. i thought i'd end up kissing charlie too.:::['9-21-1']
but surprise!:::['9-21-2']
i missed most of the party.:::['9-21-3']
charlie's a girl, right?:::['9-21-4']
yeah, she's this new professor in my department that i did not kiss.:::['9-21-5']
i don't know why joey had to kiss her. of all the girls at the party, god!:::['9-21-6']
why do you care so much? yes, rachel. why do you care so much?:::['9-21-7']
because ross is the father of my child.:::['9-21-8']
you know, and i want him to hook up with lots of women.:::['9-21-9']
all i'm saying is, i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common.:::['9-21-10']
i don't know. they seemed to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils.:::['9-21-11']
wow. joey and a professor. can you imagine if they had kids?:::['9-21-12']
and if the kids got her intelligence......and joey's raw sexual magnetism......those nerds would get laid!:::['9-21-13']
all right. so, ross, you're okay with all this? i mean...:::['9-21-14']
it's no big deal. i just met her. i'm fine with it.:::['9-21-15']
god, i forgot how hot she was.:::['9-21-16']
i'm gonna get some more coffee. all: hi.:::['9-21-17']
oh, you know, i'll come with you. okay.:::['9-21-18']
so a professor, huh? yeah. she is cool. and she's so smart.:::['9-21-19']
her mind is totally acrimonious.:::['9-21-20']
guess that's not how she used it.:::['9-21-21']
i feel like i owe you an explanation.:::['9-21-22']
i don't ordinarily go around kissing guys at parties.:::['9-21-23']
well, i'm kind of embarrassed. i really hope you don't think less of me.:::['9-21-25']
think less of you? no. i don't think less of you.:::['9-21-26']
i mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them.:::['9-21-27']
those people who like someone and don't kiss them......those people are stupid.:::['9-21-28']
i hate those people.:::['9-21-29']
actually, i'm a little surprised at myself.:::['9-21-30']
i mean, joey's so different from the guys i usually date.:::['9-21-31']
they're all professors, intellectuals. paleontologists mostly.:::['9-21-32']
you know, very cerebral... yeah, i know the type.:::['9-21-33']
if we want to grab a bite before work, we'd better get acrimonious.:::['9-21-34']
no? am i getting close?:::['9-21-35']
hey! monica: hi.:::['9-21-36']
hey, you guys. look what i just got.:::['9-21-37']
oh, wow! i love those! where did you get them?:::['9-21-38']
i bought them off ebay. they used to belong to the late shania twain.:::['9-21-39']
phoebe, shania twain is still alive.:::['9-21-40']
oh, then i overpaid.:::['9-21-41']
monica: hey, what's this?:::['9-21-42']
oh, it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho.:::['9-21-43']
you can't show phoebe this. she hates those corporate massage chains.:::['9-21-44']
what, now i can't get a massage?:::['9-21-45']
there are so many things that she disapproves of.:::['9-21-46']
i can't eat veal. i can't wear fur.:::['9-21-47']
i can't go hunting.:::['9-21-48']
do you want to go hunting? i would like to have the option.:::['9-21-49']
what's that? hey, rachel? ah...:::['9-21-50']
no, you can't go there!:::['9-21-51']
you know how i feel about these big massage places.:::['9-21-52']
they're putting people like me out of business.:::['9-21-53']
she wants to go hunting too!:::['9-21-54']
phoebe, come on, i don't want to waste it.:::['9-21-55']
it would be like throwing away 100 bucks.:::['9-21-56']
okay, this is not about the money. okay?:::['9-21-57']
it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts......and leaving us hollow shells.:::['9-21-58']
i don't care about any of that.:::['9-21-59']
well, do you care about friendship? i feel really strongly about this.:::['9-21-60']
please don't use this gift certificate. i'm asking you as a friend.:::['9-21-61']
oh, not as a friend. phoebe!:::['9-21-62']
fine. i won't use it.:::['9-21-63']
promise? i promise.:::['9-21-64']
thank you. well, i am going hunting.:::['9-21-65']
hey, honey. i missed you today.:::['9-21-66']
chandler: oh, yeah? yeah. hey.:::['9-21-67']
what do you wanna do tonight? oh, well, maybe we could, uh...:::['9-21-68']
okay, trying to turn me on by making a mess?:::['9-21-69']
know your audience.:::['9-21-70']
besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests.:::['9-21-71']
until then, you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.:::['9-21-72']
do we really need to take those tests?:::['9-21-73']
we've been trying to have a baby for a year.:::['9-21-74']
i think it's a good idea to find out if everything's okay.:::['9-21-75']
just a few routine tests. but i don't want to do it in a cup.:::['9-21-76']
what is the big deal? it's weird! you're in a doctor's office.:::['9-21-77']
it's not okay to do it in a doctor's office......but it is okay to do it in:::['9-21-78']
a parked car behind a taco bell?:::['9-21-79']
i cannot believe ross told you that.:::['9-21-80']
and in my defense, it was a wendy's.:::['9-21-81']
look, i don't want to do these tests either.:::['9-21-82']
but i really do think it's a good idea.:::['9-21-83']
i'm sure a doctor's office can't be worse......than on a class trip:::['9-21-84']
to the hershey factory.:::['9-21-85']
oh, yeah! rachel talks too!:::['9-21-86']
who says wine has to cost more than milk?:::['9-21-87']
joey: hey! hi.:::['9-21-88']
come on in. how are you? i'm good.:::['9-21-89']
can i offer you a drink? please.:::['9-21-90']
i have been crazed all day.:::['9-21-91']
i had a meeting with the dean, my syllabus for summer school's due......and i'm writing the foreword:::['9-21-92']
for a book.:::['9-21-93']
i had a pretty hectic day at work too. today i had to open a door and go::::['9-21-94']
so i am just so excited to be here.:::['9-21-95']
i can't wait to explore the city. if you need a tour guide...:::['9-21-96']
oh, you mean it? that would be so fun.:::['9-21-97']
oh, yeah, definitely. definitely. okay. what do you want to see first?:::['9-21-98']
we could go see the kronos quartet at avery fisher hall.:::['9-21-99']
there's a collection of walt whitman letters on display at the public library.:::['9-21-101']
but first, i have to see the met. okay, let me stop you right there.:::['9-21-103']
the mets suck, okay?:::['9-21-104']
you wanna see the yankees.:::['9-21-105']
no. no, not the mets. the met. singular.:::['9-21-106']
which one? they all suck.:::['9-21-107']
the museum.:::['9-21-108']
hi there. hello. welcome to lavender day spa.:::['9-21-110']
how may i help you?:::['9-21-111']
hi. i have a massage appointment under rachel green.:::['9-21-112']
okay. and here is my gift certificate.:::['9-21-113']
this has been torn up. and taped back together.:::['9-21-114']
okay. well, i'll call you as soon as your massage therapist is ready.:::['9-21-115']
okay. have a seat through the glass doors.:::['9-21-116']
through the glass doors. through the glass doors.:::['9-21-117']
alrighty then.:::['9-21-118']
phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room.:::['9-21-119']
do we have to talk like that when they're not around?:::['9-21-120']
oh, no. no, no.:::['9-21-121']
listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?:::['9-21-122']
sorry. everyone is booked. that woman can't know i work here.:::['9-21-123']
she's a friend of mine and i made this big stink......about how awful:::['9-21-124']
these massage chains are.:::['9-21-125']
then why do you work here? because it's good money.:::['9-21-126']
but that doesn't change the fact......that this is an evil, bloodsucking:::['9-21-127']
corporate machine.:::['9-21-128']
well, i think this is a great place to work.:::['9-21-129']
okay, are they listening?:::['9-21-130']
ross. hey. ross: hi.:::['9-21-131']
i need to talk to you about charlie.:::['9-21-132']
oh, do you? do you really?:::['9-21-133']
yeah, i'm kind of having a little problem.:::['9-21-134']
look, if you don't know what the word "acrimonious" means, just don't use it.:::['9-21-135']
look, you know charlie, right?:::['9-21-136']
she's cool, funny, her body is so... get to the problem.:::['9-21-137']
right. she's just so much smarter than all the girls i've ever dated.:::['9-21-138']
combined.:::['9-21-139']
you know? and i just... i don't want her to think i'm stupid.:::['9-21-140']
are you wearing two belts?:::['9-21-141']
hey, what do you know?:::['9-21-142']
you were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.:::['9-21-143']
well, she wants to go to all these cultural places......and i don't know how to talk about:::['9-21-144']
that stuff. you gotta help me out.:::['9-21-145']
i don't want to get involved in your guys' relationship.:::['9-21-146']
oh, dude, please. come on, you're the smartest person i know.:::['9-21-147']
and i really like this girl, okay? i don't want to lose her.:::['9-21-148']
okay. let's see.:::['9-21-150', '10-17-215']
oh, you should take her to the met. the mets.:::['9-21-151']
no, no, no. the met. the metropolitan museum of art.:::['9-21-152']
oh, that's what she meant.:::['9-21-153']
if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the "muse," you know?:::['9-21-154']
short for "museum" and avoid all the confusion.:::['9-21-155']
yeah, most days the place is packed with confused, angry baseball fans.:::['9-21-156']
okay. all right, so i'll take her to the met.:::['9-21-157']
yeah. okay. there's this great rare bookstore on madison avenue.:::['9-21-158']
you know what? she loves architecture.:::['9-21-159']
you should take a walk down fifth to the st. patrick's cathedral.:::['9-21-160']
and there, there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.:::['9-21-161']
jeez. sounds like you should be going on this date.:::['9-21-162']
and you know what...? okay, slow down.:::['9-21-164']
you're going way too fast. okay? just go back to the met. okay.:::['9-21-165']
so you gotta tell me exactly what to do there.:::['9-21-166']
when you walk into the museum, take a right, okay?:::['9-21-167']
that's the antiquities wing.:::['9-21-168']
ancient egypt, mesopotamia, up to the byzantine empire.:::['9-21-169']
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.:::['9-21-170']
okay. so i walk in the door and make a right.:::['9-21-171']
i have a weird feeling about this place. how do i know......they won't secretly videotape me:::['9-21-172']
and put it all over the internet?:::['9-21-173']
because, honey, and i mean this in the sweetest way possible......nobody's gonna wanna watch that.:::['9-21-174']
mr. bing? here you are.:::['9-21-175']
go into that room and deposit your specimen into the container.:::['9-21-176']
deposit my specimen?:::['9-21-177']
i usually have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk.:::['9-21-178']
thanks. got it.:::['9-21-179']
all right. honey, my tests are down the hall.:::['9-21-180']
are you sure you're gonna be okay? yeah, i guess.:::['9-21-181']
look, i know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares.:::['9-21-182']
no one here even knows you.:::['9-21-183']
oh, come on!:::['9-21-185', '10-6-226', '2-18-155']
how great is this?:::['9-21-186', '9-7-315']
we're probably fertile. let's go home.:::['9-21-187']
why are you here?:::['9-21-188', '4-24-288']
sid and i are trying again and we had trouble last time...:::['9-21-189']
no, no, no. i mean, why? why is she here?:::['9-21-190']
oh, someone's a little cranky today because they have to do it in a cup. ha, ha, ha.:::['9-21-191']
oh, they gave you the kiddie size.:::['9-21-192']
this was fun. but i've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to.:::['9-21-194']
i'd love to stay but i've got a hot date.:::['9-21-195']
please go. just let me know if you need a hand. ha, ha, ha.:::['9-21-196']
i think it just fell off.:::['9-21-197']
hello, ja.:::['9-21-198']
it's time for your massage, ja?:::['9-21-199']
put your face in the hole.:::['9-21-200']
a swedish massage from a real swedish person.:::['9-21-201']
okay, then i'm swedish.:::['9-21-202']
rachel: so, what's your name?:::['9-21-203']
it's a normal swedish name.:::['9-21-204']
ikea.:::['9-21-205']
wow. what an interesting name. yeah.:::['9-21-206']
you know, i... time for your scalp massage.:::['9-21-207']
wow. i really love your...:::['9-21-209']
is something wrong? no, it's just, um...:::['9-21-210']
it just feels so good......lkea.:::['9-21-211']
hey, say, you'll know this. what's the capital of sweden?:::['9-21-212']
stockholm.:::['9-21-214']
damn. i wish i knew if that was right.:::['9-21-215']
note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas.:::['9-21-216']
monet painted quickly, and usually outdoors......as his elusive subject:::['9-21-217']
was light itself.:::['9-21-218']
now, do you have any idea what you just said?:::['9-21-219']
no, no. my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking "monster trucks.":::['9-21-220']
now, remember, when you get to the museum......monet is not spelled m-o-n-a-y.:::['9-21-221']
i wrote that out phonetically for you. phonetically?:::['9-21-223']
yeah, that means... we just don't have time for this.:::['9-21-224']
i gotta say, i'm really impressed you were able to memorize all this so quickly.:::['9-21-225']
i'm an actor. i can memorize anything.:::['9-21-226']
last week on days, i had to say::::['9-21-227']
"frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy.":::['9-21-228']
wow. what does that mean? no idea.:::['9-21-229']
but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene......so i guess it means,"you'll get eaten by a bear.":::['9-21-230']
so let's move on to the renaissance. okay.:::['9-21-232']
caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here......to highlight the anguish:::['9-21-233']
of the central figure.:::['9-21-234']
touch it. it's really bumpy.:::['9-21-235']
nuh-uh. uh-uh. no, no, no. no ad-libbing. and, dude, you can't touch the paintings.:::['9-21-236']
come on. no. no!:::['9-21-237']
my specimen's in the room.:::['9-21-238']
i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there.:::['9-21-239']
really helped speed the process along.:::['9-21-240']
janice, you're not gone?:::['9-21-241']
sid is still in his room.:::['9-21-242']
i don't allow porn at home, so this is like a vacation for him.:::['9-21-243']
so did you do it? did you make your deposit?:::['9-21-244']
yeah. the hard part's over. that's not the hard part, honey.:::['9-21-245']
the hard part's what comes next. aren't you worried about the results?:::['9-21-246']
i haven't even thought about the results.:::['9-21-247']
i just assumed everything would be okay.:::['9-21-248']
well, you know what? it probably is.:::['9-21-249']
but what if it's not okay?:::['9-21-250']
i mean, what if there's a reason we can't have a baby?:::['9-21-251']
chandler. look, you and monica are meant to have children.:::['9-21-252']
i'm sure it's gonna be just fine.:::['9-21-253']
yeah. yeah. okay. thanks. i can't believe i didn't even think of that.:::['9-21-254']
i guess i was so worried about having to come here and do that.:::['9-21-255']
you can do it in a taco bell parking lot......but you can't do it:::['9-21-256']
at a doctor's office?:::['9-21-257']
it was a wendy's!:::['9-21-258']
and that's the swedish national anthem. thank you for asking.:::['9-21-259']
rachel: wow, lkea.:::['9-21-260']
what a rich culture.:::['9-21-261']
you know what? i have a friend who's a masseuse.:::['9-21-262']
oh? ja, ja? ja. she's not very good, though.:::['9-21-263']
uh-huh, uh-huh.:::['9-21-264', '7-19-200', '4-18-166']
and why do you think that is? i don't know.:::['9-21-265']
maybe it's because she's got such callousy fingers......from playing crummy guitar.:::['9-21-266']
or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots......because you're such:::['9-21-267']
a high-maintenance tight-ass.:::['9-21-268']
phoebe! you know it's me?:::['9-21-269']
well, for like a half an hour!:::['9-21-270']
man, you can lie about sweden!:::['9-21-271']
how can you come here?:::['9-21-272']
why didn't you tell me you work here? i don't have to tell you everything!:::['9-21-273']
you do if you're gonna make me feel guilty for getting a free massage.:::['9-21-274']
tip's not included. oh!:::['9-21-275']
why did you lie to me about working here?:::['9-21-276']
because i was ashamed, okay? i sold out for the cash.:::['9-21-277']
and they give me benefits, like medical and dental and a four-oh-wunk.:::['9-21-278']
but, you know, you pay a price. now i'm this corporate stooge......and punching a clock......and paying taxes!:::['9-21-279']
phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much......you should walk out there:::['9-21-280']
right now and quit.:::['9-21-281']
be true to what you believe in.:::['9-21-282']
honey, you have principles, and i so admire that.:::['9-21-283']
i don't have any.:::['9-21-284']
you know what? you're right. i am gonna quit.:::['9-21-285']
it's time i took my life back. good for you, pheebs.:::['9-21-286']
if you guys have microphones in there too, i didn't mean any of that.:::['9-21-288']
aha! got you! die! die! die!:::['9-21-290']
respectfully, professor r. geller. hey. hi.:::['9-21-291']
hey, how was the met? oh!:::['9-21-292']
the museum was amazing. yeah?:::['9-21-293']
yeah, joey really knows his art, huh?:::['9-21-294']
not so much, no.:::['9-21-295']
he had clearly memorized all this stuff to say......and some of it didn't:::['9-21-296']
even make any sense.:::['9-21-297']
what do you mean? well, for one......he was talking about paintings:::['9-21-298']
that were nowhere around.:::['9-21-299']
wait a minute. when you guys walked into the met, did you go to the right?:::['9-21-300']
no. no, we went to the left. oh, joey, joey, joey.:::['9-21-301']
still, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.:::['9-21-302']
yeah. yeah, it's fun.:::['9-21-303']
actually, joey's your friend......and you don't know me that well.:::['9-21-305']
it'd be weird.:::['9-21-306']
well, i mean, a little. but no, what? go on.:::['9-21-307']
i'm thinking that maybe joey isn't the right guy for me right now.:::['9-21-309']
you know, maybe i should be with someone......i have more in common with.:::['9-21-310']
you know what i mean?:::['9-21-311', '10-14-224', '3-14-263']
yeah, but you know what?:::['9-21-313']
i think you should give joey a chance.:::['9-21-314']
i mean, he's a great guy.:::['9-21-315']
and sure, he doesn't know that much about art......but you can always talk about:::['9-21-316']
that with someone else.:::['9-21-317']
i guess that's true. if you think about it......he memorized all that stuff because:::['9-21-318']
he thought it was important to you.:::['9-21-319']
you know, that's the kind of guy joey is.:::['9-21-320']
he is very sweet.:::['9-21-321']
plus, he is hot!:::['9-21-322']
that was gonna be my next argument.:::['9-21-323']
joey: hey. ross & charlie: hey.:::['9-21-324']
you ready? yeah. let's go.:::['9-21-325']
joey: wow.:::['9-21-326', '9-15-57']
thanks, ross. yeah.:::['9-21-327']
hey, ross. that art stuff worked. you hooked me up.:::['9-21-328']
glad i could help, man.:::['9-21-329']
some of the stuff wasn't where you said it would be, but i made it work.:::['9-21-330']
it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.:::['9-21-331']
oh. hi, dr. connelly.:::['9-21-333']
no. well, she's not here......but i can tell her.:::['9-21-334']
should i be sitting down for this?:::['9-21-335']
well, so, what does that mean?:::['9-21-338']
okay. okay, thank you.:::['9-21-339']
hey, sweetie.:::['9-21-341', '10-6-33', '10-3-18', '5-21-161']
dr. connelly just called.:::['9-21-342']
with good news? of course it's not good news.:::['9-21-343']
you said, "dr. connelly just called.":::['9-21-344']
if it was good, you'd have said, "dr. connelly just called!":::['9-21-345']
so, what is it? is it?:::['9-21-346']
is there a problem? is there a problem with me, or with you?:::['9-21-347']
actually, it's both of us.:::['9-21-348']
apparently, my sperm have low motility......and you have:::['9-21-350']
an inhospitable environment.:::['9-21-351']
well, what does that mean?:::['9-21-353']
it means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers......and you have a uterus that is:::['9-21-354']
prepared to kill the ones that do.:::['9-21-355']
it means... wait, chandler.:::['9-21-356']
it means that we can keep trying......but there's a good chance:::['9-21-357']
this may never happen for us.:::['9-21-358']
well......we're gonna figure this out.:::['9-21-362']
good morning, phoebe. good morning, receptionist.:::['9-21-364']
here's your schedule for the day. your first client is in room 1.:::['9-21-365']
"rachel green." son of a bitch! she came back?:::['9-21-366']
are you ready for your scottish massage?:::['9-21-367']
put your face in the hole, lassie!:::['9-21-368']
rachel: joey?:::['9-1-0']
so, uh......i guess we should:::['9-1-3']
make it official, huh?:::['9-1-4']
uh, look, rach, i...:::['9-1-5']
hey, ross is here! hey, look, it's my good friend ross.:::['9-1-6']
hey, ross. hey, joey.:::['9-1-7']
hey, you. hey, you.:::['9-1-8']
and he brought flowers. oh, thanks, ross. i'm really more of a candy kind of guy.:::['9-1-9']
you're weird today.:::['9-1-10']
listen, i, uh, wanted to talk to you about something.:::['9-1-11']
yeah. actually, uh, i kind of need to talk to you too.:::['9-1-12']
uh, joey, could you give us a minute? no.:::['9-1-13']
what? i'm sorry. i meant, "no.":::['9-1-14']
monica: hi. hey, look who's here. all: hey.:::['9-1-15']
where's my granddaughter? i've been practicing my magic tricks.:::['9-1-16']
he pulled a quarter out of my ear.:::['9-1-17']
hey, where's, uh, mom? she went to pick up aunt liddy.:::['9-1-18']
aunt liddy's coming? that means we get $5 each.:::['9-1-19']
so when do i get to meet emma and show her this::::['9-1-20']
okay, wow.:::['9-1-21']
uh, dad, emma's in the nursery. i'll take you now if you want.:::['9-1-22']
but i really want to talk to you. i know. i still need to talk to you.:::['9-1-23']
but before you guys do that, i need to talk to you.:::['9-1-24']
and, ross, i need to talk to you.:::['9-1-25']
oh, and i need to talk to you. about what?:::['9-1-26']
to see if you know what these guys are talking about.:::['9-1-27']
monica: isn't she beautiful?:::['9-1-28']
look at her, my first grandchild.:::['9-1-29']
what about ben?:::['9-1-30']
well, of course, ben. i meant my first granddaughter.:::['9-1-31']
have, um, you thought any more about you and rachel?:::['9-1-33']
yeah, actually i was gonna talk to her when you guys came in the room.:::['9-1-34']
yay, that's so exciting. wow. you could've done that with us there.:::['9-1-35']
yeah, right. oh, sure. okay.:::['9-1-36']
you can touch yourself in front of us, but you can't talk to rachel.:::['9-1-37']
what? when have i ever touched myself in front of you guys?:::['9-1-38']
oh, please. just before, when you were asleep in the lounge.:::['9-1-39']
that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv.:::['9-1-40']
that reminds me. that mr. hazmegian still has my game boy.:::['9-1-41']
chandler, can i talk to you for a second? sure.:::['9-1-42']
dude, i just did something terrible.:::['9-1-43']
that was you? i thought it was jack.:::['9-1-44']
no, no. that was jack. rachel thinks i asked her to marry me.:::['9-1-45']
what? why does she think that? because it kind of looked like i did.:::['9-1-46']
again, what?:::['9-1-47']
okay, i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand...:::['9-1-48']
as we all are at some point during the day.:::['9-1-49']
it wasn't my ring. it fell out of ross' jacket......and when i knelt down to pick it up,rachel thought i was proposing.:::['9-1-50']
ross had a ring? and he was gonna propose?:::['9-1-51']
i guess. and you did it first?:::['9-1-52']
this is gonna kill him. you know how much he loves to propose.:::['9-1-53']
i know. i know. it's awful.:::['9-1-54']
well, what did she say?:::['9-1-55']
she said yes.:::['9-1-56']
does ross know?:::['9-1-57']
oh, my god. what the hell am i gonna tell him?:::['9-1-58']
maybe you don't have to tell him. ooh, i like that. yeah.:::['9-1-59']
if you clear things up with rachel, ross never needs to find out.:::['9-1-60']
but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass.:::['9-1-61']
all right, let's not get carried away.:::['9-1-62']
honey, we've been over this. i need to be facing the other way.:::['9-1-64']
come on. if we have sex again, it'll double our chances of getting pregnant.:::['9-1-65']
i think that closet's still available. i am so tired.:::['9-1-66']
yeah, okay, but no foreplay. deal.:::['9-1-67']
dad, seriously.:::['9-1-68']
you know, you really should see someone about that.:::['9-1-69']
noted.:::['9-1-70']
i wanna go talk to rachel for a minute. are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?:::['9-1-71']
are you kidding me? i could stay and look at her forever.:::['9-1-72']
actually, uh...:::['9-1-73']
are you all right? um... uh...:::['9-1-75']
i think i just got engaged. oh, my god. he did it?:::['9-1-76']
what? did you know he was gonna ask me?:::['9-1-77']
are you kidding? i'm, like, the one who talked him into it.:::['9-1-78']
i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.:::['9-1-79']
and you really think this is a good idea? i just talked him into it.:::['9-1-80']
don't tell me i have to do you too?:::['9-1-81']
the puppet master gets tired, people. okay.:::['9-1-82']
i don't know. it just doesn't feel right.:::['9-1-83']
why? you two are so meant to be together. everybody thinks so.:::['9-1-84']
really? even ross?:::['9-1-85']
oh, uh, hey, pheebs. uh, you know what? i'll, uh, come back later.:::['9-1-87']
wow, kind of a full house here. heh.:::['9-1-88']
i guess i'll just... i'll come back.:::['9-1-89']
there he goes. your fiancé.:::['9-1-90']
although he does play with himself in his sleep.:::['9-1-92']
i can't say i'm surprised.:::['9-1-93']
dad, what are you doing? there are people in there having sex.:::['9-1-94']
it can't be me. i'm standing right here.:::['9-1-95']
wanna peek? no.:::['9-1-96']
you know what? i don't like you without mom.:::['9-1-98']
we're not peeking?:::['9-1-100']
well, i'm peeking.:::['9-1-101']
chandler: hello, sir. you know monica.:::['9-1-103']
hey, uh, is it okay to come in? rachel: of course.:::['9-1-105']
oh, joey, this ring, i... it's beautiful. i love it.:::['9-1-106']
yeah. uh, look, rach, there's something i gotta tell you.:::['9-1-107']
are you ready to try nursing again? yeah. hi, emma.:::['9-1-109']
why do you think she won't take my breast?:::['9-1-110']
it's all right, honey. it takes babies a while to get it.:::['9-1-111']
but don't worry, it'll happen. okay.:::['9-1-112']
yowza.:::['9-1-113']
okay, sweetie, you can do it. just open up and put it in your mouth.:::['9-1-114']
dear lord.:::['9-1-115']
i'm sorry, honey, what were you saying? uh, yeah, look, i think that...:::['9-1-116']
oh, look. she's pulling away again.:::['9-1-117']
do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth?:::['9-1-118']
she looks scared. doesn't she look scared?:::['9-1-119']
you know, i don't really know her.:::['9-1-120']
why don't we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow?:::['9-1-121']
rachel: okay. are you kidding me?:::['9-1-122']
this is so frustrating. why doesn't she want my breast?:::['9-1-123']
i don't know. maybe she's crazy.:::['9-1-124']
oh, hey, wait up. hi.:::['9-1-125']
i didn't want to say anything in front of joey. i didn't know if he knew yet.:::['9-1-127']
what? that we had a baby? now let's give him a little credit. heh.:::['9-1-128']
although he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.:::['9-1-129']
no, no, that you and rachel are engaged.:::['9-1-130']
heh. what? oh, it's a secret?:::['9-1-131']
oh, goody. yes. ooh, we haven't done the secret thing in a long time.:::['9-1-132']
phoebe, there is no secret, okay? i didn't propose.:::['9-1-133']
are you lying?:::['9-1-134']
is this like that time you tried to convince us you were a doctor?:::['9-1-135']
i am a doctor.:::['9-1-136']
you know what? i'm just gonna go and talk to rachel myself.:::['9-1-137']
all right. well, me too.:::['9-1-138']
shh. well, should we wake her up? no. no. come on, let her sleep.:::['9-1-139']
she's so exhausted. and so engaged. dum-dum-dum.:::['9-1-140']
oh, my god. she thinks we're engaged.:::['9-1-141']
why? why, why would she think we're engaged?:::['9-1-142']
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring?:::['9-1-143']
you know, ross, doctors are supposed to be smart.:::['9-1-144']
i didn't give her that ring. you didn't?:::['9-1-145']
no. so whose ring is it?:::['9-1-146']
it's mine.:::['9-1-147']
is it an engagement ring? yes.:::['9-1-148']
but you didn't give it to her? no.:::['9-1-149']
but you were going to propose? no.:::['9-1-150']
huh. i might be losing interest in this.:::['9-1-151']
look. look, my mom gave me that ring......because she wanted me:::['9-1-152']
to propose to rachel.:::['9-1-153']
but all i wanted to do was see......if she maybe, kind of wanted:::['9-1-154']
to start things up again.:::['9-1-155']
oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.:::['9-1-156']
i didn't want to rush into anything. it seemed like she didn't want to either.:::['9-1-157']
but i don't understand how any of this happened.:::['9-1-158']
what, did she find the ring in my jacket, assume i was gonna propose......throw it on:::['9-1-159']
and just start telling people?:::['9-1-160']
no, no. she said you actually proposed to her.:::['9-1-161']
well, i didn't. i didn't propose.:::['9-1-162']
did i?:::['9-1-164']
i haven't slept in 40 hours and...:::['9-1-165']
it does sound like something i would do.:::['9-1-166']
look, we can't stay in here forever.:::['9-1-167']
ugh. it's just, i still can't believe that my dad saw us having sex.:::['9-1-168']
he didn't make it to one of my piano recitals, but this he sees.:::['9-1-169']
this is okay. we're all adults here. there's nothing to be ashamed of.:::['9-1-170']
now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.:::['9-1-171']
i can still call you that, right? of course. i'll always be your dad.:::['9-1-173']
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.:::['9-1-174']
it wasn't fun? why, why, why would you?:::['9-1-175']
look, i just don't want you to think......that we're animals who do it:::['9-1-176']
whenever we want.:::['9-1-177']
well, i don't think that.:::['9-1-178']
before today, i never thought of you two having sex at all.:::['9-1-179']
it was a simpler time.:::['9-1-180']
the truth is, dad, we're trying.:::['9-1-181']
what? yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.:::['9-1-182']
oh, my god, this is so exciting.:::['9-1-183']
well, get back in there. i'll guard the door.:::['9-1-184']
ha, ha. that's okay, dad, we can wait until later.:::['9-1-185']
whoa, whoa, whoa. i don't think so. aren't you ovulating?:::['9-1-186']
daddy.:::['9-1-187']
you gotta get at it, princess.:::['9-1-188']
when your mother and i were trying to conceive you......whenever she was ovulating,bam, we did it.:::['9-1-189']
that's how i got my bad hip.:::['9-1-190']
that's funny. this conversation's how i got the bullet hole in my head.:::['9-1-191']
this one time i had my knee up on the sink, and your mother, she was...:::['9-1-192']
daddy, i don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had.:::['9-1-193']
you're right. this is about your positions.:::['9-1-194']
now, what i saw in the closet is not the optimum position......for conceiving a child.:::['9-1-195']
although it might feel good. i don't feel good right now.:::['9-1-196']
but pleasure is important, and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.:::['9-1-197']
you up to the task, sailor?:::['9-1-198']
seriously, sir, my brains, all over the wall. heh.:::['9-1-199']
hey. hey. oh, i need to tell you something.:::['9-1-200']
well, now's a good time. i'm on my way to have my ears cut off.:::['9-1-201']
joey asked me to marry him.:::['9-1-202']
what? joey proposed to me.:::['9-1-203']
is he crazy? you just had ross' baby. well, i said yes.:::['9-1-204']
what, are you crazy? you just had ross' baby.:::['9-1-205']
it's so inappropriate. no, it is worse than that. it is wrong.:::['9-1-206']
it is bigger than mine.:::['9-1-207']
i know. days of our lives, thank you very much.:::['9-1-208']
you can't marry him. why not?:::['9-1-209']
come on, i don't want to do this alone, and he's such a sweet guy.:::['9-1-210']
and he loves me so much.:::['9-1-211']
well, do you love him?:::['9-1-212']
sure? yeah, i mean, whatever.:::['9-1-214']
honey, the question is......do you really want to marry joey?:::['9-1-215']
could you be a dear and go tell him?:::['9-1-218']
you still haven't told rachel you weren't proposing?:::['9-1-219']
no. she had the ring on......she seemed so excited,and then she took her breast out.:::['9-1-220']
joey, you have to tell her what's going on. and what did it look like?:::['9-1-221']
i didn't look at it.:::['9-1-222']
the stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.:::['9-1-223']
go and tell rachel right now, before ross finds out.:::['9-1-224']
look, it's not that easy. she said she wanted to marry me.:::['9-1-225']
i don't want to hurt her.:::['9-1-226']
okay, look, just do it gently.:::['9-1-227']
you're right. i'll go tell her now before ross finds out, and i'll be gentle.:::['9-1-229']
i can do that. okay. i am a gentle person.:::['9-1-230']
oh, by the way, two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.:::['9-1-231']
listen, i, um...:::['9-1-233']
i heard about the engagement.:::['9-1-234']
surprised?:::['9-1-235']
and confused.:::['9-1-236']
rach, sweetie, i, um...:::['9-1-237']
i didn't propose to you.:::['9-1-238']
i don't think you do.:::['9-1-240']
you didn't propose to me.:::['9-1-241', '9-1-248']
joey did.:::['9-1-242']
poor baby, you're so tired.:::['9-1-243']
rach, i didn't propose to you.:::['9-1-244']
joey didn't propose to you.:::['9-1-245']
and chandler didn't propose to you.:::['9-1-246']
chandler didn't propose to me.:::['9-1-249']
but joey did.:::['9-1-250']
joey proposed to you?:::['9-1-251']
i can come back. wait. wait. wait.:::['9-1-252']
joey, did you propose to her? no.:::['9-1-253']
yes, you did. actually, technically, i didn't.:::['9-1-254']
well, then, why did you give me a ring? wait.:::['9-1-255']
you gave her the ring? no, and i did not ask her to marry me.:::['9-1-256']
yes, you did. no, i didn't.:::['9-1-257', '5-8-343']
you did, and don't you say you didn't. ah.:::['9-1-258']
he was right there. he got down on one knee and he proposed.:::['9-1-259']
whoa, you were down on one knee? yeah, that looks bad.:::['9-1-260']
but i didn't... i didn't propose.:::['9-1-261']
then what did happen? yeah, what did happen?:::['9-1-262']
okay, the ring fell on the floor, and i went down to pick it up......and you thought i was proposing.:::['9-1-263']
yeah, but you said, "will you marry me?":::['9-1-264']
no, i didn't. yes, you did.:::['9-1-265', '4-4-207']
no, i didn't. yes, you did. oh, my god, you didn't.:::['9-1-266']
ugh! why didn't you tell me that before? well, i tried......but people kept coming in,and then you took your breast out.:::['9-1-267']
whoa, hey.:::['9-1-268']
whoa, whoa, whoa. you saw her breast?:::['9-1-269']
i'll tell you about it later. be cool.:::['9-1-270']
joey, then what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?:::['9-1-271']
it wasn't my ring. it's ross' ring.:::['9-1-272']
that's why i felt so bad, rach, because he was gonna propose.:::['9-1-273']
you were gonna propose to me? uh...:::['9-1-275']
well, this is awkward.:::['9-1-277']
but i was going to see if, you know, maybe you wanted to start dating again.:::['9-1-278']
but that... i mean, that was all, rach. dude, step up. i proposed.:::['9-1-279']
no, you didn't.:::['9-1-280', '5-19-177']
that's right. there's a lot going on here, and i think i ate some bad fruit earlier.:::['9-1-281']
hey, she just woke up. she's hungry. why don't we give this another try? okay.:::['9-1-282']
i can't believe you told her i was gonna propose.:::['9-1-283']
i can't believe you're not gonna propose. hey, i am not gonna rush into anything.:::['9-1-284']
oh, yeah, dude, i totally understand.:::['9-1-285']
usually after i have a baby with a woman, i like to slow things down.:::['9-1-286']
rachel: oh, my god. ross: what?:::['9-1-287']
she's doing it. she's breast-feeding. look.:::['9-1-288']
uh-huh. oh, it's beautiful.:::['9-1-289']
i'll come back for her later. okay. thank you.:::['9-1-290']
oh, wow, this feels weird. what, good weird?:::['9-1-291']
wonderful weird.:::['9-1-292']
you know what, you guys? i'm, uh... i'm gonna go too.:::['9-1-293']
and, uh, i'm sorry about everything.:::['9-1-294']
honey, don't worry, it was my mistake. no, rach, i should've told you sooner.:::['9-1-295']
it's just that...:::['9-1-296']
man, that kid is going to town.:::['9-1-297']
oh. she's perfect.:::['9-1-298']
we're so lucky.:::['9-1-299']
we really are.:::['9-1-300']
look, i know it's not a proposal, and i don't know where you are......but with everything that's been:::['9-1-301']
going on and with emma, i'm...:::['9-1-302']
i've been feeling... i know, i know.:::['9-1-303']
i've been feeling...:::['9-1-304']
okay, well, that... wow, okay, well, um...:::['9-1-306']
then maybe at least we can talk about us again?:::['9-1-307']
yeah. maybe.:::['9-1-308', '10-14-233', '4-21-64']
well, good. okay. uh, heh...:::['9-1-309']
i kind of think, you know, if we... lf...:::['9-1-310']
you're wearing the ring.:::['9-1-311']
what...? what's that?:::['9-1-312']
and you told phoebe you were engaged.:::['9-1-313']
i'm sorry, what?:::['9-1-314']
when you thought joey proposed......did you say yes?:::['9-1-315']
kids, i spoke to a doctor and picked up these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.:::['9-1-316']
hey, dad. hi.:::['9-1-317']
sorry to bother you again, but could you pass my pamphlets back?:::['9-1-318']
oh, hi. chandler: hey.:::['9-3-0']
so, what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?:::['9-3-1']
our news. my company has asked me to head up our office in tulsa.:::['9-3-2']
so as of monday, i'm being officially relocated.:::['9-3-3']
phoebe: oh, my god! what? monday?:::['9-3-4']
how long do you have to go for? they said it could be up to a year.:::['9-3-5']
ross: a year? well, do you have to go?:::['9-3-6']
well, i kind of have to, don't i?:::['9-3-7']
because of this stupid thing.:::['9-3-8']
there's nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?:::['9-3-9']
wait a minute. wait, you can't go to tulsa.:::['9-3-10']
maybe you forgot, but we have tickets to the jets game next week!:::['9-3-11']
well, i'm sorry, but i don't think i'll be able to make it.:::['9-3-12']
but we were gonna go see the jets!:::['9-3-13']
you can't go. i mean, you're the glue that holds this group together.:::['9-3-14']
really? not you.:::['9-3-15']
i can't believe you guys are moving.:::['9-3-16']
i call their apartment! all: no! no!:::['9-3-17']
here you go, rach. oh, thank you, joey. yeah.:::['9-3-18']
oh, you know what? i'm not even sure i can have caffeine.:::['9-3-19']
i went through this with ben and carol. one coffee won't affect your milk.:::['9-3-20']
yeah, just to be sure, i'm gonna call dr. wiener.:::['9-3-21']
every time? mm-hm.:::['9-3-22']
you don't have to call him whenever you have a question, okay?:::['9-3-23']
trust me. i know this. all right. i trust you.:::['9-3-24']
i can see you dialing. i don't understand why...:::['9-3-25']
shh, i'm on the phone! dr. wiener?:::['9-3-26']
it's so weird seeing ross and rachel with a baby. it's just so grown-up.:::['9-3-27']
i know, yeah. i feel like we're all growing up.:::['9-3-28']
a person named "wiener." god, that kills me.:::['9-3-29']
look at you all grown-up. yeah. well, actually, you know what?:::['9-3-30']
i am, you know?:::['9-3-31']
well, that whole thing with rachel made me realize......that maybe i'm ready for a more:::['9-3-32']
serious relationship, you know?:::['9-3-33']
like, i'd like to meet a nice, mature, commitment-minded lady.:::['9-3-34']
and looks aren't as important as...:::['9-3-35']
nah, she's gotta be hot. phoebe: mm-hm:::['9-3-36']
you know, i might know somebody.:::['9-3-37']
how about you set me up with someone, and we double-date?:::['9-3-38']
i can do that. yeah. how's, uh, friday?:::['9-3-39']
done! all right.:::['9-3-40']
oh, good, really? yeah. okay, let's see. hee, hee.:::['9-3-41']
um, oh, you know who's great? sandy poopack.:::['9-3-43']
"poopack"? ha-ha-ha.:::['9-3-44']
yeah. all right. well, that rules out lana titwyler.:::['9-3-45']
i've got good news. you got out of the whole tulsa thing?:::['9-3-47']
okay, i have news.:::['9-3-48']
you don't have to move to tulsa. you can stay here and keep your job.:::['9-3-49']
that's great! how?:::['9-3-50']
my boss and i worked out a deal where i'm in tulsa four days a week.:::['9-3-51']
so the other three, i can be here with you.:::['9-3-52']
so you're gonna be gone four days a week?:::['9-3-53']
i'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?:::['9-3-55']
no. i can't be away from you for that long.:::['9-3-56']
really? yeah, you're my husband.:::['9-3-57']
i won't live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.:::['9-3-58']
that's fast math. we could use you in tulsa.:::['9-3-59']
thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you go to tulsa, i go with you.:::['9-3-60']
ha-ha-ha. hey.:::['9-3-61']
you said that without gagging.:::['9-3-62']
well, excuse me?:::['9-3-64']
oh, yeah? well, up yours too!:::['9-3-65']
who the hell was that? dr. wiener.:::['9-3-66']
rach, you can't call people at 3 in the morning.:::['9-3-67']
you know what? you sound just like his wife.:::['9-3-68']
was there anything even wrong with emma?:::['9-3-69']
yes, of course there is! okay? i'm not insane.:::['9-3-70']
what was it?:::['9-3-71']
hiccups.:::['9-3-72']
i told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.:::['9-3-73']
well, not anymore i can't. he fired us!:::['9-3-74']
what are we gonna do? we have to find a pediatrician.:::['9-3-75']
wait, wait, wait. monica said that when you guys were growing up......you liked your doctor.:::['9-3-76']
what was his name?:::['9-3-77']
dr. gettleman?:::['9-3-78']
uh, yeah, no, i don't think that's a good idea.:::['9-3-79']
in fact, i think... i think he's dead. ugh!:::['9-3-80']
why does everything happen to me?:::['9-3-81']
i promise, first thing tomorrow, we'll find another doctor.:::['9-3-82']
but i gotta get up early, and i'm not feeling well.:::['9-3-83']
you're not feeling well? what do you have? rubella?:::['9-3-84']
because don't go near emma, she has not had that shot.:::['9-3-85']
you know, come to think of it, it does feel rubella-like.:::['9-3-86']
wiener!:::['9-3-87']
wiener! wiener! wiener!:::['9-3-88']
great! now he's gonna know it was me!:::['9-3-90']
so how is this for our big double date tonight?:::['9-3-92']
ooh. great. just the reaction i was hoping for.:::['9-3-94']
yeah, so you, uh, found someone for me? you didn't forget?:::['9-3-95']
of course not. and you'll love mary ellen.:::['9-3-96']
she's really smart and cute and funny and...:::['9-3-97']
i can't tell you how i know this, but she is not opposed to threesomes.:::['9-3-98']
all right. yeah.:::['9-3-99']
so tell me something about my guy. no.:::['9-3-100']
come on, give me something. what's his name?:::['9-3-101']
mike. yeah. mike. okay, what's his last name?:::['9-3-102']
damn it! is there no mystery left in romance anymore?!:::['9-3-103']
we'll see you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.:::['9-3-104']
all right, great. all right, bye. yeah. see you. bye-bye.:::['9-3-105']
why'd i have to say mike? i don't know a mike! why couldn't i have said?:::['9-3-106']
there's no guys in there!:::['9-3-107']
ugh, it's impossible to find a good doctor. how do you know the good ones......from the ones who'll push:::['9-3-108']
their penis against your knee?:::['9-3-109']
i know what she's talking about.:::['9-3-111']
well, we've gotta find a new pediatrician.:::['9-3-112']
ross was getting sick last night, and emma may have caught it.:::['9-3-113']
why don't you see dr. gettleman? ross said he died.:::['9-3-114']
he didn't die. i just saw his daughter last week.:::['9-3-115']
she said he was fine. her, on the other hand, botched botox.:::['9-3-116']
oh, great. well then, i'm gonna take emma to see him.:::['9-3-117']
i wonder why ross said that he died?:::['9-3-118']
oh, maybe he confused him with his childhood therapist.:::['9-3-119']
he saw a therapist?:::['9-3-120']
mm-hm. he used to have a recurring nightmare. it freaked him out.:::['9-3-121']
wow, what was it?:::['9-3-122']
that i was going to eat him.:::['9-3-123']
mike!:::['9-3-124']
i can't believe i'm doing this with you.:::['9-3-127']
although i did just end a nine-year relationship......so i should be open:::['9-3-128']
to taking some risks.:::['9-3-129']
it'll be fine. follow my lead, okay? all you have to do is pretend to be mike.:::['9-3-130']
i am mike. attaboy.:::['9-3-131']
here they come.:::['9-3-132']
hi, i'm phoebe. mike: hey, phoebe.:::['9-3-133']
i'm mike. nice to meet you. phoebe: joey, this is mary ellen jenkins.:::['9-3-134']
so, mike, how do you and joey know each other, anyway?:::['9-3-135']
uh, how do joey and i know each other?:::['9-3-136']
wow, if i had a nickel for every time somebody's asked me that.:::['9-3-137']
from school. we met in college.:::['9-3-138']
i mean high school.:::['9-3-139']
you guys go way back, then. so, what are you up to these days?:::['9-3-140']
well, i'm a lawyer. mike, attorney at law! ha, ha.:::['9-3-141']
actually, i just gave up my practice. joey: what?:::['9-3-142']
that's the kind of thing you usually run by me. ha, ha.:::['9-3-143']
i want to play piano professionally. if i don't do this now, i never will.:::['9-3-144']
great. i like that better than the lawyer thing.:::['9-3-145']
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike. ha, ha.:::['9-3-146']
you thought he was still a lawyer.:::['9-3-147']
no, that's not what i meant. let's get you a cocktail.:::['9-3-148']
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa.:::['9-3-151']
aw, that's so sweet. did you find anything?:::['9-3-152']
slim pickins. hmm. nothing, huh?:::['9-3-153']
no. slim pickins. it's a barbecue joint.:::['9-3-154']
they're looking for a cook. actually, "cook" may be a bit of a stretch.:::['9-3-155']
they're looking for somebody to shovel mesquite.:::['9-3-156']
"slim pickins"? that is so cheesy.:::['9-3-157']
well, so cheesy also has an opening.:::['9-3-158']
heh, honey, that's okay. i know this woman, nancy......who's a restaurant biz headhunter.:::['9-3-159']
she may know something.:::['9-3-160']
can i say how much i appreciate you coming with me?:::['9-3-161']
when we get to tulsa, i am taking you for a great dinner at slim pickins.:::['9-3-162']
so cheesy?:::['9-3-163']
whole hog?:::['9-3-164']
it's gonna be tough to keep kosher in tulsa.:::['9-3-165']
hi, nancy? hi, it's monica geller.:::['9-3-166']
i'm good. listen, i'm looking for a job in tulsa.:::['9-3-167']
yeah, well, my husband's been relocated. ha, ha.:::['9-3-168']
because i love him.:::['9-3-169']
no, i don't want a job in new york.:::['9-3-170']
javu's looking? oh, my god!:::['9-3-171']
he asked for me personally? oh, my god!:::['9-3-172']
oh, uh, wow, this is really, really flattering.:::['9-3-173']
but, um, i'm moving to tulsa.:::['9-3-174']
so, just, if you would tell javu......i'll take it!:::['9-3-175']
hi. um, my name's rachel green. i have an appointment for emma.:::['9-3-176']
dr. gettleman is finishing up with a patient. he'll be out shortly.:::['9-3-177']
okay, thank you.:::['9-3-178', '5-24-99', '3-23-317']
i think you just have a cold. it's definitely not strep.:::['9-3-179']
thanks, doctor.:::['9-3-180']
would you like a lollipop? do you even have to ask?:::['9-3-181']
he is alive!:::['9-3-182']
it's so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long......and i've never heard about you.:::['9-3-183']
oh, that's, uh, because we had a bit of a falling out.:::['9-3-184']
mike hit my mom with a car.:::['9-3-185']
no, i didn't. that's okay. i have forgiven you.:::['9-3-186']
now we're friends again, and everything's great. heh.:::['9-3-187']
well, wait. is your mom okay?:::['9-3-188']
please, we're trying to have a conversation.:::['9-3-189']
wow, you're a lot nicer on days of our lives.:::['9-3-190']
days of our lives! that's why you look so familiar!:::['9-3-191']
do you not know each other?:::['9-3-194']
of course we do. he's playing a game we used to play in high school.:::['9-3-195']
we pretend we don't know each other. we played all kinds of games.:::['9-3-196']
you remember that one where i punch you in the face for not being cool?:::['9-3-197']
let me ask you something: how many sisters does joey have?:::['9-3-198']
six. what are you doing? i said seven!:::['9-3-199']
joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?:::['9-3-201']
because i forgot about our date. i'm so sorry.:::['9-3-202']
i'm sorry too. and just to be clear, i didn't hit his mother with a car.:::['9-3-203']
you are unbelievable. i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you.:::['9-3-204']
mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose.:::['9-3-205']
oh, who are you kidding?:::['9-3-207']
you find some guy off the street for me?:::['9-3-208']
god, this is humiliating!:::['9-3-209']
i'm so sorry. if you don't like this guy, i can find you a better one.:::['9-3-210']
mike? mike? oh.:::['9-3-211']
it was nice meeting you.:::['9-3-213']
you're leaving too? i'll stay if you can tell me my name.:::['9-3-214']
have a good night. mm-hm.:::['9-3-215']
we leave tomorrow, and you still have a lot to pack.:::['9-3-216']
maybe i shouldn't go.:::['9-3-218']
what? um.:::['9-3-219']
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, javu?:::['9-3-220']
but it's just a little outside of tulsa.:::['9-3-221']
well, how far outside?:::['9-3-222']
manhattan?:::['9-3-223']
and, uh, you're thinking of taking it?:::['9-3-224']
before, you said that being with me was more important than any job.:::['9-3-225']
but i guess now it's, uh, old job, me, new job.:::['9-3-226']
i'm gonna miss this hand! ha, ha.:::['9-3-227']
i know this is a lot to ask......but, my god, this is:::['9-3-228']
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.:::['9-3-229']
what happened to "you can't live without me four days a week"?:::['9-3-230']
well, if you really think about it, i mean, four days is not that long.:::['9-3-231']
i see you monday before you go to work......and thursday when you get back......and i always work late on tuesdays,so really if you think about it, ha, ha......it's really just one day.:::['9-3-232']
um, well, if we can't make it one day, we got real problems, my friend.:::['9-3-233']
i think you should take the job. really?:::['9-3-234']
i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.:::['9-3-235']
that's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me.:::['9-3-236']
how was the pediatrician? rachel: oh, i really liked him.:::['9-3-238']
yeah, yeah. it was really, really, really good.:::['9-3-239']
you promised not to say anything. i know.:::['9-3-240']
ross still sees his pediatrician!:::['9-3-241']
are you serious? you still see dr. gettleman?:::['9-3-243']
he is a brilliant diagnostician!:::['9-3-244']
diagnostician or boo-boo fixer? rachel: mm.:::['9-3-245']
seriously, you gotta go to an appropriate doctor.:::['9-3-246']
why? i know it's a little weird, but, hey, he is a great doctor, okay?:::['9-3-247']
he knows my medical history.:::['9-3-248']
and every time i go in there, he makes a big deal.:::['9-3-249']
you know, "ah, look, it's my favorite patient.":::['9-3-250']
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your tushy?:::['9-3-251']
i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college.:::['9-3-252']
that was not a security blanket. that was a wall hanging.:::['9-3-253']
it didn't spend much time on the wall!:::['9-3-254']
oh, excuse me, uh.:::['9-3-255']
hi. i was hoping to run into you. uh, can we talk?:::['9-3-256']
i'm sorry, really. i'm so embarrassed.:::['9-3-258']
is it all right?:::['9-3-259']
really, i'm a pretty nice guy. just ask my parole officer.:::['9-3-260']
apparently, i'm not a funny guy.:::['9-3-261']
well, why did you go along with that?:::['9-3-262']
because i was told that i'd get a free dinner, which i didn't.:::['9-3-263']
and that i'd meet a pretty girl, which i did.:::['9-3-264']
that's true.:::['9-3-265', '7-1-161', '7-13-34']
well, is anything you told me about yourself true?:::['9-3-266']
my name is mike. and i do play piano.:::['9-3-267']
oh, uh-huh, uh-huh. prove it. there isn't a piano here.:::['9-3-268']
that wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.:::['9-3-269']
you are really good.:::['9-3-271']
uh, um.:::['9-3-272']
i play a little guitar myself. really? uh-huh. that's great.:::['9-3-273']
what kind of music do you play? um, like acoustic, folksy stuff.:::['9-3-274']
but right now i'm working on a couple iron maiden covers.:::['9-3-275']
do you think that, maybe, sometime, i could, uh...:::['9-3-276']
it's okay. go ahead, ask me out.:::['9-3-277']
okay. you think, maybe, sometime i could take you out?:::['9-3-278']
oh, you just caught me off guard, um.:::['9-3-279']
yeah, that would be nice.:::['9-3-280']
look at this! my two best friends!:::['9-3-281']
excuse me, uh. i don't mean to be a jerk......but the baby with the rash:::['9-3-282']
came in after me.:::['9-3-283']
the doctor will be right with you, sir.:::['9-3-284']
mommy, i can't find waldo.:::['9-3-285']
what, the circus? he's behind the elephant.:::['9-3-286']
wow. so your child's a big fan of the waldo books too?:::['9-3-287']
yeah, that's how i know.:::['9-3-288']
i'm ross, by the way. hi, i'm sally.:::['9-3-289']
ross: hi.:::['9-3-290', '4-17-274']
so no ring. can i assume you're also a single parent?:::['9-3-291']
i am a single parent. it's hard, isn't it?:::['9-3-292']
there's no time for a social life. where are you gonna meet someone?:::['9-3-293']
well, um... ...let's say, i don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office. uh.:::['9-3-294']
rossie? we're ready for you.:::['9-3-295']
um, yeah...:::['9-3-296']
come on, ross jr. it's time to go in.:::['9-3-297']
mommy.:::['9-3-298']
mommy, what's wrong with that man?:::['9-3-299']
hey, i helped you find waldo!:::['9-3-300']
oh, good, you haven't left yet. where have you been?:::['9-3-301']
i got held up at dr. gettleman's office, um.:::['9-3-302']
there was some guy that, uh, freaked everybody out.:::['9-3-303']
you got here just in time. i really have to go, buddy.:::['9-3-304']
promise to call me when you land? of course i will. i love you.:::['9-3-306']

a big leaver with a stupid suitcase.:::['9-3-314']

joey! he had to board.:::['9-3-334']
you said you'd marry joey?:::['9-2-0']
okay, you have to realize, i was exhausted, i was emotional.:::['9-2-1']
i would have said yes to anybody.:::['9-2-2']
like that time when you and i got married.:::['9-2-3']
i'm not helping.:::['9-2-4']
so you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?:::['9-2-5']
that is right. and traditionally, the daddy gives the mommy a present.:::['9-2-6']
but i am prepared to let that go.:::['9-2-7']
so when i came here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again......you were engaged to my best friend?:::['9-2-8']
i thought chandler was your best friend.:::['9-2-11']
well, chandler's my oldest friend. mm-hm. joey's my... no! uh-uh! ah.:::['9-2-12']
hey, i'm gonna take off. i just wanted to say goodbye.:::['9-2-13']
rachel said she'd marry you?:::['9-2-14']
this isn't the right room. sorry, folks.:::['9-2-15']
i don't want to be negative. so i'll say most of the signs you bought are good.:::['9-2-16']
no, they ran out of "it's a girl!" but i can fix this one.:::['9-2-17']
see? huh? mm.:::['9-2-18']
so sexy.:::['9-2-19']
honey, why don't you lie down? it's okay.:::['9-2-21']
ross and rachel will be back soon, and then i gotta go to the office.:::['9-2-22']
am i producing them?:::['9-2-23']
why are you so tired? i couldn't sleep last night.:::['9-2-24']
i started worrying about this big divisional meeting i have today.:::['9-2-25']
the more i worried, the more i couldn't sleep.:::['9-2-26']
you know, and then i was, like, "if i fall asleep now, i'll get six hours' sleep.:::['9-2-27']
but if i fall asleep now, i'll get five hours' sleep.":::['9-2-28']
no matter what i did, i couldn't fall asleep.:::['9-2-29']
you know what you should've done? told yourself that little story.:::['9-2-30']
hi. phoebe: hey.:::['9-2-31', '5-23-70', '3-2-56']
welcome home. rachel: hi.:::['9-2-32']
phoebe did the signs.:::['9-2-33']
oh, you guys, thanks for doing this.:::['9-2-34']
look at all that stuff people sent. rachel: oh.:::['9-2-35']
oh! ha, ha.:::['9-2-36']
oh, my gosh. look, there's something every mother needs.:::['9-2-37']
a giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up the entire apartment.:::['9-2-38']
what are people think...? oh, you guys, i love it.:::['9-2-39']
hey, so, uh, where's ross?:::['9-2-40']
uh, he's downstairs getting the stuff out of the cab.:::['9-2-41']
uh, is he still mad at us? well, you more than me.:::['9-2-42']
but he can't stay too mad at me. i mean, i just had his baby. ha, ha.:::['9-2-43']
that's not fair. i can't do that.:::['9-2-44']
i'm not sure you should be here when he comes up.:::['9-2-45']
i didn't think i should be here either. but somebody said he'd be over it.:::['9-2-46']
hey, what do i know? i wanted to get a bigger gorilla.:::['9-2-47']
the numbers we're seeing in chicago, new york and london are solid.:::['9-2-48']
but many of our field offices have reported disappointing yields.:::['9-2-49']
boston is down. atlanta is down. houston is down.:::['9-2-50']
i could go on and on. but instead of boring you......i'll go straight to my 42-point plan.:::['9-2-51']
walter.:::['9-2-52']
phoebe: she's just so cute.:::['9-2-53']
oh, i just want to bite her ear off and use it as a sucking candy.:::['9-2-54']
phoebe. ha, ha.:::['9-2-56']
but i could take one of those little feet and put it in a pita pocket.:::['9-2-57']
okay. i put most of the stuff away. oh, great. the pacifiers?:::['9-2-58']
uh, it's in the, uh, cupboard. the, uh, burping cloths?:::['9-2-59']
uh, linen closet. the diapers?:::['9-2-60']
in the hospital.:::['9-2-61']
wow, you guys got a hospital? fancy. no, i, uh, left the diapers at the hospital.:::['9-2-62']
there's some in the bag, but i'll run out and get some more.:::['9-2-63']
all right, thanks. oh, could you stop at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin?:::['9-2-64']
oh, sure. what kind? um, let me think.:::['9-2-65']
what do i want?:::['9-2-66']
please, take your time. it's an important decision, not like......say, i don't know, deciding to marry:::['9-2-67']
someone. this is about a muffin.:::['9-2-68']
blueberry. blueberry it is.:::['9-2-69']
wow, he's not letting this go, is he? rachel: unh.:::['9-2-71']
god, how long do you think that's gonna last?:::['9-2-72']
i don't know. he got over the "we were on a break" thing quickly.:::['9-2-73']
you know what, i can't worry about it right now.:::['9-2-74']
because i've got the cutie little baby. monica: hmm.:::['9-2-75']
oh. i can't believe how much i love her. i mean, i can't get enough of her.:::['9-2-76']
like, right now? i miss her. i actually miss her.:::['9-2-77']
you know, that's her?:::['9-2-78']
oh, god, look at her sleeping. oh, i love her so much.:::['9-2-79']
i think i'm gonna wake her up. ha, ha. oh, rach, no.:::['9-2-80']
you know, you're never supposed to wake a sleeping baby.:::['9-2-81']
well, i can do whatever i want. i made her.:::['9-2-82']
come on, little girl. oh, yes. hello, emma. hello. hi.:::['9-2-83']
well, i would say i told you so, but she's kind of doing that for me.:::['9-2-84']
i'm sorry. oh, mommy's so sorry. go back to sleep. shh, shh, shh.:::['9-2-85']
go back to sleep.:::['9-2-86']
oh, it breaks your heart, doesn't it? oh, it really does.:::['9-2-87']
how long do you think we have to stay?:::['9-2-88']
okay, if everyone's on board, it's settled.:::['9-2-89']
chandler? yeah.:::['9-2-91']
mckenna: are you on board?:::['9-2-92']
well, then problem solved. chandler will run our office in tulsa.:::['9-2-94']
you're gonna love oklahoma.:::['9-2-95']
all right. we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her...:::['9-2-96']
oh, try this one. "go back in time and listen to phoebe.":::['9-2-97']
all right, here's something. rachel: what?:::['9-2-98']
it says to try holding the baby close to your body......and then swing her rapidly:::['9-2-99']
from side to side.:::['9-2-100']
it worked!:::['9-2-102']
then emma gags]:::['9-2-103']
oh. no. just stopped to throw up a little bit.:::['9-2-104']
oh. mon, what am i gonna do?:::['9-2-106']
it's been hours, and it won't stop crying.:::['9-2-107']
she, rach. not it. she. yeah. i'm not so sure.:::['9-2-108']
oh, my god, i'm losing my mind. yeah, no kidding.:::['9-2-109']
all right, this just proves no good can come from having sex with ross!:::['9-2-110']
hey, gunther. can i get a couple of blueberry muffins to go?:::['9-2-111']
diapers, huh? yep.:::['9-2-112']
so i guess rachel had your baby?:::['9-2-113']
yep. can you believe it? nope.:::['9-2-114']
i can't even believe she slept with you in the first place.:::['9-2-115']
oh. oh. you, ha, ha, mean, like, uh...:::['9-2-117']
i know you're pissed at me, but we have to talk about this.:::['9-2-120']
uh, actually, uh, we don't.:::['9-2-121']
fine. okay. but i gotta say, technically, i didn't even do anything wrong.:::['9-2-122']
what? you didn't do anything wrong?:::['9-2-123']
i said i didn't technically. ross: okay.:::['9-2-124']
let's put aside the fact that you "accidentally"......picked up my grandmother's ring and:::['9-2-125']
you "accidentally" proposed to rachel.:::['9-2-126']
can i just stop you there for a second?:::['9-2-127']
when people do this::::['9-2-128']
i don't really know what that means.:::['9-2-129']
you were saying?:::['9-2-130', '2-2-83']
and i could even understand that you couldn't tell rachel.:::['9-2-131']
but why couldn't you tell me, huh? you had all day to, and you didn't.:::['9-2-132']
i know. i should've. "i'm sorry.":::['9-2-133']
not using it right, joe.:::['9-2-134']
oh. "i'm sorry.":::['9-2-135']
i'm gonna go. no, come on.:::['9-2-136']
ross, we have to get past this. give me the bag.:::['9-2-137']
no, i don't know what else to do. i said i'm sorry, now...:::['9-2-138']
now you should scream at me or curse me or hit me.:::['9-2-139']
i'm not gonna hit you. you'll feel better. i'll feel better.:::['9-2-140']
you know you want to, i can see it in your eyes.:::['9-2-141']
no, i don't. a little bit.:::['9-2-142']
no. little bit.:::['9-2-143']
no. a little bit more.:::['9-2-144']
give me the bag. give me the bag. no, hit me. hit me.:::['9-2-145']
give me the bag. i'm not kidding. hit me.:::['9-2-146']
no. hit me. hit me. hit me!:::['9-2-147']
you ducked! i'm sorry! it was a reflex!:::['9-2-148']
oh, my god! this really hurts! i couldn't help it.:::['9-2-149']
when a fist comes at your face, you duck. look.:::['9-2-150']
you were supposed to duck! why didn't you?:::['9-2-152']
let's talk on the way to the hospital.:::['9-2-153']
good. yeah, maybe while we're there, they can check your reflexes.:::['9-2-154']
oops!:::['9-2-155']
try feeding her again. i already fed her.:::['9-2-156']
i know. that's why i said, "again!":::['9-2-157']
you guys, we can't turn on each other, okay?:::['9-2-158']
that's just what she wants.:::['9-2-159']
monica, can i talk to you outside?:::['9-2-161']
just stay here. i'm gonna check her diaper. pheebs, you wanna come?:::['9-2-162']
oh, i'm kind of part of this.:::['9-2-163']
actually, it's a husband-and-wife kind of thing.:::['9-2-164']
i knew i should've married chandler.:::['9-2-165']
monica: okay, what's up? okay. um, ahem.:::['9-2-166']
you know we said it would be fun to move to paris for a year?:::['9-2-167']
and you could study french cooking, and i could write......and we could picnic along the seine,and go wine-tasting in bordeaux.:::['9-2-168']
you know how people say that tulsa......is the paris of oklahoma?:::['9-2-170']
what? who says that?:::['9-2-171']
people who have never been to paris?:::['9-2-172']
well, what's going on? we're moving to tulsa.:::['9-2-173']
excuse me? okay.:::['9-2-175']
ms. mckenna, she kind of, uh, works above my boss...:::['9-2-176']
she asked me to move to tulsa and be president of our office there.:::['9-2-177']
and i was sleeping and apparently said yes.:::['9-2-178']
tulsa, oklahoma? the sooner state.:::['9-2-179']
whatever that is.:::['9-2-180']
chandler, i don't even want to see the musical oklahoma.:::['9-2-181']
"oh, what a beautiful mornin"'? "surrey with the fringe on top"?:::['9-2-182']
are you trying to tell me we're moving to oklahoma or that you're gay?:::['9-2-183']
all right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?:::['9-2-184']
no. but they are going to lease us a ford focus.:::['9-2-185']
i'll get out of it. thank you.:::['9-2-186']
what is wrong with emma? oh, she misunderstood.:::['9-2-187']
she thought she was moving to tulsa.:::['9-2-188']
ma'am, uh, do you have a minute?:::['9-2-189']
i kind of have some bad news. i don't think i can move to tulsa.:::['9-2-190']
what? uh, it's a funny story, actually.:::['9-2-191']
ha, ha. ahem.:::['9-2-192']
um, i kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning.:::['9-2-193']
so when i said i'd move to tulsa, i didn't really know what i was saying.:::['9-2-194']
but only because i was up all night worried about this meeting.:::['9-2-196']
isn't that funny?:::['9-2-197']
irony. not a fan? all right.:::['9-2-198']
see, here's the thing.:::['9-2-199']
i went home and told my wife about tulsa, and she won't go.:::['9-2-200']
see me, i love tulsa. tulsa is heaven. tulsa is italy.:::['9-2-201']
please don't make me go there.:::['9-2-202']
chandler, i... no, no, no.:::['9-2-203']
look, carol. can i call you carol?:::['9-2-204']
why would i when your name is elaine?:::['9-2-205']
sorry. oh!:::['9-2-206']
what a great picture of your son. strapping.:::['9-2-207']
that's a picture of your daughter, isn't it?:::['9-2-208']
well, she's lovely. i like a girl with a strong jaw.:::['9-2-209']
i'll call you from tulsa.:::['9-2-210']
hey. so, uh, how is it?:::['9-2-211']
i broke my thumb. your thumb?:::['9-2-212']
that's weird. are you sure you're punching right?:::['9-2-213']
make a fist.:::['9-2-214']
maybe later.:::['9-2-215']
ross, i feel terrible.:::['9-2-216']
you know what, you can go. i just have to, uh, fill out some forms.:::['9-2-217']
you, uh, want me to help you with that?:::['9-2-218']
why, does it look like i'm having trouble with my misshapen claw?:::['9-2-219']
name?:::['9-2-220']
no, i know ross. but what's it short for?:::['9-2-221']
you know, like rossell.:::['9-2-222']
or, uh... or rosstrophor.:::['9-2-223']
just ross.:::['9-2-224']
it's pretty.:::['9-2-226']
okay, date of birth? you know my birthday.:::['9-2-227']
may... tember?:::['9-2-229']
october 18. occupation? dinosaurs.:::['9-2-230']
actually, i'm a paleon... dinosaurs is fine.:::['9-2-231']
the drawing is not.:::['9-2-232']
all right. uh, who do you want as your emergency contact?:::['9-2-233']
uh, rachel, i guess. okay. relationship?:::['9-2-234']
ooh, boy, this could take a while.:::['9-2-235']
just, uh...:::['9-2-236']
just put roommate. come on.:::['9-2-237']
you guys are more than that. you're gonna get together, right? ahem.:::['9-2-238']
i don't think that we are.:::['9-2-239']
but you two are supposed to be together.:::['9-2-240']
well, i thought so too. but then she said she'd marry you.:::['9-2-241']
come on, ross, that didn't mean anything.:::['9-2-242']
she'd just had the baby. she was all freaked out about doing it alone.:::['9-2-243']
she would have said yes to anybody. yeah, that's what she said.:::['9-2-244']
so? so i don't want to be just anybody.:::['9-2-245']
wow. you know what?:::['9-2-246']
it's better this way anyway.:::['9-2-247']
i don't know what i was thinking, going down that road again with us.:::['9-2-248']
it's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.:::['9-2-249']
and you're okay with that? yes. that's what we always planned.:::['9-2-251']
and if you have a plan, you should stick to it.:::['9-2-252']
that's why they call them plans. hello? ha, ha.:::['9-2-253']
hey, for what it's worth......with rachel, i don't think:::['9-2-255']
you'll ever be just "anybody.":::['9-2-256']
hey, there you go.:::['9-2-257']
"thanks.":::['9-2-258']
oh, my god. how long has she been crying?:::['9-2-259']
about a week and a half. oh.:::['9-2-260']
well, it looks like you guys got it under control, so i'm just gonna go.:::['9-2-261']
no? really? misery really does love company?:::['9-2-262']
try holding her a different way. look, i'm doing the best i can.:::['9-2-264']
anyone else is welcome to try. all right, i'll try. fine.:::['9-2-265']
yes. okay. rachel: okay, here you go.:::['9-2-266']
okay. rachel: oh, gosh.:::['9-2-267']
nothing works with this child!:::['9-2-269']
oh, god, what am i gonna do, you guys? i can't even comfort my own baby.:::['9-2-270']
i'm the worst mother ever. no, you're just new at this.:::['9-2-271']
you'll get better. think about your first day at work.:::['9-2-272']
that couldn't have been easy, but you figured that out.:::['9-2-273']
yeah, i don't think dressing provocatively is going to help me here!:::['9-2-274']
oh, god, just please take her. okay, i'll take her. come here.:::['9-2-275']
rachel: oh, i have to go to the bathroom.:::['9-2-276']
okay. i have to go scream into a pillow.:::['9-2-277']
bouncy. bouncy baby. bouncy baby.:::['9-2-278']
oh, baby, baby. oh, baby, baby.:::['9-2-279']
oh, baby, baby, baby.:::['9-2-280']

it worked. oh, baby, baby, baby. oh, baby, baby, baby.:::['9-2-282']
you must be a fireball in bed!:::['9-2-283']
i can't believe it. she's asleep. i got her to go to sleep.:::['9-2-284']
i have actual magical powers.:::['9-2-286']
i can hear traffic and birds.:::['9-2-287']
i can hear the voices in my head again.:::['9-2-288']
i'm kidding.:::['9-2-289', '4-14-55']
oh, my god! you got her to stop crying!:::['9-2-290']
yes, i did. i'm monica, super aunt.:::['9-2-291']
you are the official baby-crier stopper. yes, i am.:::['9-2-292']
oh. you're never leaving the apartment. say what?:::['9-2-293']
that's your new job, day or night. she starts crying, i need you here.:::['9-2-294']
oh, no, no, no. thankfully, you don't need me at all.:::['9-2-295']
so okay. hey, super aunt? see you later. ha, ha.:::['9-2-296']
rachel? let's give it six to eight months.:::['9-2-297']
okay, so listen, i'm gonna go lay down.:::['9-2-299']
the book says whenever she's sleeping, i should be sleeping.:::['9-2-301']
we just got her to go to sleep. oh, so there can't be any yelling?:::['9-2-305']
we're moving to tulsa.:::['9-2-307']

hey. hey. where have you been?:::['9-2-312']
what happened to you? uh, i had a little thing with joey.:::['9-2-313']
if you think this is bad, you should see him. ha, ha.:::['9-2-314']
oh. no, ross, this is not good.:::['9-2-315']
we have to talk about this joey thing. please sit.:::['9-2-316']
all right, you have got to get over this joey thing.:::['9-2-317']
okay? i never really wanted to marry joey, okay?:::['9-2-318']
you know what i really, really want?:::['9-2-320']
what, rach?:::['9-2-321']
i wanna sleep.:::['9-2-322']
i wanna eat. i wanna take a shower.:::['9-2-323']
i mean, before she wakes up, and we gotta do this all over again.:::['9-2-324']
right. i mean, because i got news for you.:::['9-2-325']
emma: not easy.:::['9-2-326']
well, that's what i'm here for. mm-hm.:::['9-2-327']
you want me to get that? no, that's really okay.:::['9-2-328']
monica? got it, got it, got it, got it.:::['9-2-329']
uh, i've been thinking about this. and i gotta tell you, it's not my fault.:::['9-2-330']
it's a natural instinct. what are you talking about?:::['9-2-331']
okay, what would you do if i did this?:::['9-2-332']
i love my new job!:::['9-6-2']
honey, you're screaming. you bet your ass i am.:::['9-6-3']
i just had the best first day ever.:::['9-6-4']
the kitchen? twice as big as allessandro's.:::['9-6-5']
oh, that's great. monica: yeah.:::['9-6-6']
and clean? not just health department-clean, monica-clean.:::['9-6-7']

chandler, you will love him.:::['9-6-11']
he is without a doubt the funniest guy i have ever met.:::['9-6-12']
this is nice. i know.:::['9-6-13']
you need both hands for that? yeah, i kind of do.:::['9-6-14']
well, how's this?:::['9-6-15']
oh, look at you two holding hands.:::['9-6-16']
is this getting serious?:::['9-6-17']
well, i, you know...:::['9-6-18']
have you not talked about it yet?:::['9-6-19']
am i making you uncomfortable?:::['9-6-20']
if you were bigger you'd hit me, huh?:::['9-6-21']
i'm sorry, heh.:::['9-6-22']
it's obviously way too early for us to be having that conversation.:::['9-6-23']
is it? maybe not. is it?:::['9-6-24']
okay, when i got divorced......i didn't think i'd feel this way about:::['9-6-25']
someone for a really long time.:::['9-6-26']
then again, i didn't think i'd meet someone like you.:::['9-6-27']
and this may be crazy-soon, but i want you to have this.:::['9-6-28']
no, not... that's gum. oh.:::['9-6-29']
oh, five bucks. i love it when that happens, you know?:::['9-6-30']
you don't know it's there... i know. keep digging.:::['9-6-31']
oh. it's a key.:::['9-6-33']
to be honest, i think i'd prefer the five dollars.:::['9-6-34']
it's to my apartment. oh, wow.:::['9-6-35']
ooh. big step for phoebe and mike.:::['9-6-36']
look, i don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key...:::['9-6-37']
no, i want to. oh, thank god.:::['9-6-38']
wow. i was starting to think i'd never meet someone that......you know, i wanted to do this with.:::['9-6-40']
this is cool, huh? it really is.:::['9-6-42']
oh, i know it. it is amazing. these little things open doors.:::['9-6-43']
so i don't go back to work for another four weeks......but we would like our nanny:::['9-6-44']
to start right away......so that emma could get:::['9-6-45']
a chance to know her.:::['9-6-46']
i think that's really smart.:::['9-6-47']
the easier we can make the transition for her the better.:::['9-6-48']
that's great. great.:::['9-6-49']
so do you have any questions for us? not really.:::['9-6-50']
all right. well, thank you so much for coming.:::['9-6-51']
ross: thank you. it was really nice to meet you.:::['9-6-52']
we will call you. oh, you know, wait.:::['9-6-53']
i do have one question. rachel: yeah.:::['9-6-54']
do you guys do random drug testing?:::['9-6-55']
boy, we, uh, hadn't really thought of that.:::['9-6-56']
that's cool. but if you do, i'm gonna need three days' notice.:::['9-6-57']
okey-dokey.:::['9-6-58']
wow. we're never gonna find a nanny.:::['9-6-59']
come on, rach. we will. i promise. we have more interviews.:::['9-6-60']
and worse comes to worst, we can always reconsider the, uh, first one we met with.:::['9-6-61']
what, the blond with no bra? she was blond?:::['9-6-62']
just a sec.:::['9-6-63']
okay, this one's name is sandy. okay.:::['9-6-64']
she's got a degree in early childhood education.:::['9-6-65']
uh, she worked for her last family for three years.:::['9-6-66']
hi. i'm sandy.:::['9-6-68']
and she's a little mannish.:::['9-6-69']
ah! oh, my god. david. hi.:::['9-6-70']
uh, is this a bad time? no, it's a great time. come in.:::['9-6-71']
wow. hi.:::['9-6-72']
oh, my gosh. what are you doing here? are you back from minsk?:::['9-6-73']
well, just for a couple of days.:::['9-6-74']
i'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant......why it's a positive thing that:::['9-6-75']
we've spent all their money......and, uh, accomplished, uh, nothing.:::['9-6-76']
who cares? it got you here.:::['9-6-77']
well, it got me to new york anyway. then i got in a cab at the airport......and the guy said, "where to?":::['9-6-78']
i just gave him your address. i didn't even think about it.:::['9-6-79']
wow. where's your luggage?:::['9-6-80']
all right, i'll call the cab company.:::['9-6-82']
we can call them later. can you just stand there for a moment?:::['9-6-83']
there's an old russian expression, um, that goes::::['9-6-85']
roughly translated, that means, um::::['9-6-86']
"this thing that i'm looking at: wow.":::['9-6-87']
uh, no, you should see me when... actually, no, i look pretty good.:::['9-6-89']
you know, when you don't see someone for a long time......and you kind of build them up:::['9-6-91']
in your head, you start thinking::::['9-6-92']
"come on, don't be crazy, nobody's that beautiful.":::['9-6-93']
but, well, you are.:::['9-6-94']
well, so, um, are you seeing anyone?:::['9-6-95']
i'm just the worst person ever.:::['9-6-97']
how can i not tell david that i'm seeing mike?:::['9-6-98']
maybe he didn't give you a chance.:::['9-6-99']
he said, "are you seeing someone?" and i said, "no.":::['9-6-100']
oh, well, that would've been your window. yeah.:::['9-6-101']
i mean, i don't know. i was looking in his eyes......and i was just thinking,"oh, my god, it's david. david's here.":::['9-6-102']
he's just so irresistible.:::['9-6-103']
really? the scientist guy? really? chandler?:::['9-6-104']
continue.:::['9-6-105']
okay, then it gets worse......because i told him:::['9-6-106']
i would see him tomorrow night.:::['9-6-107']
phoebe. i know. evil.:::['9-6-108']
and, and, and, and...:::['9-6-109']
i like mike so much, you know? it's just going really well. oh, my god.:::['9-6-110']
wow, isn't it ironic that david would show up......on the same day that:::['9-6-111']
you and mike exchange keys?:::['9-6-112']
yeah. you know, and given my lifelong search for irony......you can imagine how happy i am.:::['9-6-114']
what are you gonna do? i mean, i guess i just have to......tell david that nothing:::['9-6-115']
can happen between us.:::['9-6-116']
unless i don't.:::['9-6-117']
you know, complicated moral situation?:::['9-6-118']
no right, no wrong? you have to tell david.:::['9-6-119']
i knew i should've had this conversation with joey.:::['9-6-120']
funniest guy she's ever met.:::['9-6-121']
i'm funny, right?:::['9-6-122']
what do you know? you're a door.:::['9-6-123']
you just like knock-knock jokes.:::['9-6-124']
save it for inside.:::['9-6-125']
so oklahoma's a crazy place. you know, they call it the sooner state.:::['9-6-127']
frankly, i'd sooner be in any other state.:::['9-6-128']
and what's with oklahoma having a panhandle?:::['9-6-129']
can all states have stuff like that?:::['9-6-130']
hey, yeah, i'm from the, uh, waistband of wyoming.:::['9-6-131']
but when i was 7, we headed over to the crotch.:::['9-6-132']
was your cabin pressurized?:::['9-6-133']
and don't get me started on the way the people from tulsa talk.:::['9-6-134']
what's with the word "y'all"? you know, just two words just pushed together?:::['9-6-136']
are we all allowed to do that? because if so, i say why stop there?:::['9-6-137']
you know, your new poodle could be your noodle.:::['9-6-138']
and fried chicken could be fricken.:::['9-6-139']
waiter? waiter, excuse me, i'll have the fricken.:::['9-6-140']
see, that's funny with the fricken, right?:::['9-6-141']
no, it just reminds me of something this guy did today at work.:::['9-6-142']
i told you about that funny guy, jeffrey, right?:::['9-6-143']
yeah, he came up.:::['9-6-144']
well, he did this bit. you probably had to be there......but it was liza minnelli locked:::['9-6-145']
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.:::['9-6-146']
oh, ha, ha.:::['9-6-147', '3-25-218', '3-13-298']
were you there? no, but it sounds fricken funny.:::['9-6-148']
i really understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person.:::['9-6-149']
i mean, it's like leaving behind a piece of your heart.:::['9-6-150']
sandy, that's exactly what it is.:::['9-6-151']
are you gay? ross.:::['9-6-152']
it's okay. i get that a lot doing what i do.:::['9-6-153']
but i am straight. i'm engaged, actually. oh.:::['9-6-154']
her name's delia. that's pretty.:::['9-6-155']
so you're just, like, a guy who's a nanny.:::['9-6-156']
i realize how it's a bit unorthodox for some people.:::['9-6-157']
but i really believe the most satisfying thing you can do with your life......is take care of a child.:::['9-6-158']
like at my last job.:::['9-6-160']
i met daniel when he was 3 weeks old.:::['9-6-161']
and i got to watch him grow into this awesome person.:::['9-6-162']
when i left, i said, "i'll see you soon.":::['9-6-163']
and he said to me, "skadandy?":::['9-6-164']
that was his name for me. oh, ha, ha.:::['9-6-165']
"i'll see you every day right in...":::['9-6-166']
it's okay. yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.:::['9-6-167']
oh, god, she must need her diaper changed.:::['9-6-168']
i can take care of that, if you want. oh, that would be great.:::['9-6-169']
i love him, i love him, i love him.:::['9-6-170']
oh, come on. rach, he's a guy.:::['9-6-171']
so what? he's smart. he's qualified.:::['9-6-172']
give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.:::['9-6-173']
because it's weird.:::['9-6-174']
what kind of a job is that for a man? a nanny?:::['9-6-176']
i mean, it's like if a woman wanted to be...:::['9-6-177']
king?:::['9-6-179']
i, uh, hope you don't mind. i used some of my homemade lotion on emma.:::['9-6-180']
it's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. it'll dry that rash right up.:::['9-6-181']
plus, it keeps the hands young.:::['9-6-182']
yes. sandy, you're hired.:::['9-6-183']
that's great.:::['9-6-184', '7-22-225', '7-19-217', '7-5-175', '7-10-122', '10-14-74', '5-18-63', '5-4-117', '3-11-185']
it's just such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family.:::['9-6-186']
oh, god. come here.:::['9-6-187']
you gotta be at least bi.:::['9-6-188']
i need you to set me up for a joke.:::['9-6-190']
when monica's around, ask me about fire trucks.:::['9-6-191']
ooh, i don't know, chandler. i'm not so good with remembering lines.:::['9-6-192']
well, thank god your livelihood doesn't depend on it.:::['9-6-193']
i know, right?:::['9-6-194']
why are we doing this?:::['9-6-195']
monica says that her ma?tre d' is the funniest guy she's ever met.:::['9-6-196']
seriously? she actually said that? yes. am i crazy to be this upset?:::['9-6-197']
no. being funny's your thing. yeah.:::['9-6-198']
without that, you just got "lame with women.":::['9-6-199']
hi. there you are.:::['9-6-200']
fire trucks.:::['9-6-201']
wow. you look even more beautiful than you did yesterday.:::['9-6-202']
ooh. in fact, i'm going to kiss you now.:::['9-6-203']
oh, wait, wait. yeah, i can't get away with stuff like that.:::['9-6-204']
it sounded sexy in my head, so i...:::['9-6-205']
no, no, it's not that.:::['9-6-206']
remember when you asked me if i was seeing someone and i said no?:::['9-6-207']
well, um, i am. his name's mike. oh. oh.:::['9-6-208']
i should've told you. no.:::['9-6-209']
well, yeah. yeah.:::['9-6-210']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. well, it's okay. i understand.:::['9-6-211']
well, are you happy with this guy?:::['9-6-212']
i am happy. damn it.:::['9-6-213']
i'm sorry. i don't mean that. i want you to be happy.:::['9-6-214']
but only with me. no, that's not fair. who cares. leave him.:::['9-6-215']
i don't mean that. yes, i do. i'm sorry. um...:::['9-6-216']
i think i should probably, uh, go. well...:::['9-6-217']
but, david, i just want you to know that, you know......telling you this is one of the:::['9-6-218']
hardest things i've ever had to do.:::['9-6-219']
well, just so you know......hearing it wasn't exactly:::['9-6-220']
a vladnik carnival, either.:::['9-6-221']
can we at least hug goodbye? of course. yeah.:::['9-6-222']
you know, and a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate.:::['9-6-223']
no. no. i mean...:::['9-6-224']
in minsk? yeah?:::['9-6-225']
it's, um, two on each cheek... mm-hm.:::['9-6-226']
...and, uh, one on the lips. well, if that's what they do in minsk...:::['9-6-227']
in new york, it's...:::['9-6-228']
rachel: oh, boy.:::['9-6-229']
is everything all right?:::['9-6-231']
oh, yeah. no, it's fine. it's fine.:::['9-6-232']
sandy was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancée......and it was so beautiful.:::['9-6-233']
well, her favorite flower is the camellia. from the poem...:::['9-6-234']
i can't hear it again.:::['9-6-235']
you know, i can't tell it again.:::['9-6-236']
and i'm fine never having heard it.:::['9-6-237']
rach, can i see you for a sec? yeah. excuse me.:::['9-6-238']
do you realize that man has cried in our apartment three times? huh?:::['9-6-239']
i haven't cried that many times since i moved in.:::['9-6-240']
look, ross, sandy's just sensitive. that's all.:::['9-6-241']
okay, okay. see, that is the problem. he is too sensitive.:::['9-6-242']
too sensitive to take care of our baby?:::['9-6-243']
no, i mean, all i'm saying is that guy... these are amazing.:::['9-6-244']
sandy made madeleines.:::['9-6-245']
this is exactly what i'm talking about.:::['9-6-246']
what kind of a guy makes delicate french cookies? huh?:::['9-6-247']
they're not even butch, manly cookies with...:::['9-6-248']
you know, with chunks.:::['9-6-249']
well, you know, i don't know what to say.:::['9-6-250']
i mean, i never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men.:::['9-6-251']
i gotta tell you, ross, it's not like you just came in from branding cattle.:::['9-6-252']
hey, there's sensitive and there's too sensitive.:::['9-6-253']
okay, what is too sensitive?:::['9-6-254']
no, i can't. i can't do this. it's bad.:::['9-6-255']
but it's nice. and nice is good. mm-hm.:::['9-6-256']
and good is not bad. ergo, we should keep kissing.:::['9-6-257']
no, no. no. but...:::['9-6-258']
ergo.:::['9-6-259']
look, david, if you had never left, then......yeah, we'd probably still be together:::['9-6-260']
right now.:::['9-6-261']
but you did leave. and i'm with mike, and i really care about him.:::['9-6-262']
well, um, goodbye. uh...:::['9-6-263']
well, the key works.:::['9-6-264']
and, you, thanks for the face massage. thank you.:::['9-6-265']
did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?:::['9-6-266']
yeah. i think that's great. oh, really?:::['9-6-267']
did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes madeleines?:::['9-6-268']
oh. how are they? lighter than air, but that's not the point.:::['9-6-269']
rachel and i hired a male nanny.:::['9-6-271']
guys do that?:::['9-6-273']
that's weird. thank you.:::['9-6-274']
that's like a woman wanting to be a... what?:::['9-6-275']
what's the end of that sentence? yes. what is the end of that sentence?:::['9-6-276']
a penis model.:::['9-6-278']
anyway, hey, did you tell chandler that some guy from work......is the funniest guy you ever met?:::['9-6-279']
yeah. so? wow.:::['9-6-280']
really? do you not know chandler?:::['9-6-281']
is that why he's acting so weird? he's jealous?:::['9-6-282']
oh, my god, that is crazy.:::['9-6-283']
it's not like i'm attracted to jeffrey. joey: so what?:::['9-6-284']
being funny is chandler's thing. you know, like ross' thing is...:::['9-6-285']
science?:::['9-6-286']
academia? being a good father? no.:::['9-6-287']
i can't believe he's that upset about this. you have to do some damage control.:::['9-6-288']
because he's feeling like...:::['9-6-289']
chandler: hey. hey. hey.:::['9-6-290']
what are you guys talking about? ross: uh, ahem.:::['9-6-291']
rachel and i, uh, hired a male nanny.:::['9-6-292']
you got a man who's a nanny?:::['9-6-293']
you got a "manny"?:::['9-6-294']
you know, i don't mind a male nanny......but i do draw the line:::['9-6-295']
at male wet nurse.:::['9-6-296']
oh! oh! you are on a roll, mister.:::['9-6-297']
if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would've brought more pizza.:::['9-6-298']
okay. okay. stop it, you. you stop it.:::['9-6-299']
what is so funny about that?:::['9-6-300']
i don't know, it's... well, just the way you say it.:::['9-6-301']
i mean, you're funny. you have that funny thing. you're a funny guy.:::['9-6-302']
did you tell her what we talked about?:::['9-6-303']
so those were pity laughs? pity laughs?:::['9-6-305']
monica: honey, listen.:::['9-6-306']
you have nothing to worry about with jeffrey.:::['9-6-307']
oh, yeah? is he funnier than me?:::['9-6-308']
well, you're different funny.:::['9-6-309']
i mean, you're more sarcastic.:::['9-6-310']
and, well, he does bits and impressions and limericks.:::['9-6-311']
i do limericks.:::['9-6-312']
uh, there once was a man named chandler whose wife made him die inside.:::['9-6-313']
honey, you know i think you're hilarious.:::['9-6-314']
you know that joke you told me last week?:::['9-6-315']
the one about jerry lewis and the girl with the lazy eye?:::['9-6-316']
that slayed me.:::['9-6-317']
hey. i made up that joke and told it to you.:::['9-6-318']
not knowing when to shut up. yep, that's my thing.:::['9-6-319']
yup.:::['9-6-320']
so how many guys have your key?:::['9-6-321']
no, no, no. it's not as bad as it looks.:::['9-6-322']
i was saying goodbye to an old friend.:::['9-6-323']
your lipstick's on his mouth.:::['9-6-324']
oh, uh, we just, uh, happen to wear the same shade.:::['9-6-325']
no, um, david and i did used to go out.:::['9-6-326']
but years ago. and he lives in minsk. he's only in town for a couple days.:::['9-6-327']
did you, uh...? no. no.:::['9-6-328']
kiss him? oh, well, yeah.:::['9-6-329']
yes, but you should know, she really likes you.:::['9-6-330']
in fact, i don't think you realize just how lucky you are, fella.:::['9-6-331']
don't point your finger at me. why?:::['9-6-332']
what are you gonna do about it?:::['9-6-333']
well, i'll show you what i'm gonna do about it.:::['9-6-334']
oh, really? really? you want some of that? huh? huh?:::['9-6-335']
stop it. stop it. before someone gets really hurt.:::['9-6-336']
here, david, you should just go.:::['9-6-337']
but if i ever do come back from minsk, well, you just better watch out.:::['9-6-339']
if i go to minsk, you better watch out. oh, you're going to minsk?:::['9-6-340']
well, i might. really?:::['9-6-341']
well, if you do, come in the spring. it's just lovely there.:::['9-6-342']
okay, well, guys? well...:::['9-6-343']
goodbye, phoebe. bye.:::['9-6-344']
hey, what, are you kidding me? right-o. right-o.:::['9-6-345']
take good care of her.:::['9-6-346']
i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.:::['9-6-347']
if you want your key back, i totally understand.:::['9-6-348']
it's never gonna happen again, right? right. never. i swear.:::['9-6-349']
i... oh, i just want to say, if you do ever come to minsk, that's my number.:::['9-6-350']
we'll, uh, party up vladnik-style.:::['9-6-351']
joey: yeah. all right.:::['9-6-352']
hey, ross. check it out. sandy taught me "hot cross buns.":::['9-6-353']
really? sounded like "three blind mice.":::['9-6-354']
no, "three blind mice" goes like this. i swear to god.:::['9-6-355']
who's up for puppets? me. i'm up for puppets.:::['9-6-356']
well, please welcome::::['9-6-357']
the snufflebumps.:::['9-6-358']
who wants to be mr. wigglemunch and who's gonna be the grumpus?:::['9-6-359']
okay, okay, how exactly is a 2-month-old supposed to appreciate puppets?:::['9-6-360']
studies show that the movement and colors help their cerebral development.:::['9-6-361']
the whimsical characters are just for us.:::['9-6-362']
i want to be mr. wigglemunch.:::['9-6-363']
well, i guess we know who's gonna be the grumpus.:::['9-6-365']
that was kind of rude. oh, i'm sorry.:::['9-6-366']
please apologize to sandy and the snufflebumps for me.:::['9-6-367']
you know, he was just doing his job. you know what?:::['9-6-368']
i'm sorry i'm the only one who isn't in love with gary poppins out there.:::['9-6-369']
but i just... i can't go through with this.:::['9-6-370']
come on. no. you know what?:::['9-6-371']
i would never force you to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with.:::['9-6-372']
ugh, that's true.:::['9-6-373']
you want to fire him, so you're gonna have to go do it.:::['9-6-375']
so you see, wigglemunch, that's why it's important to share.:::['9-6-376']
i am learning so much from you.:::['9-6-377']
well, i'm off to tulsa.:::['9-6-378']
so if your ma?tre d' friend has any funny oklahoma jokes......tell him to e-mail me at:::['9-6-379']
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com.:::['9-6-380']
honey, you can relax.:::['9-6-381']
last night at work jeffrey told this really sexist joke.:::['9-6-382']
after that, not so funny anymore. really?:::['9-6-383']
see, that's the thing. you gotta keep it smart, people.:::['9-6-384']
okay. don't miss that flight. you know i love you.:::['9-6-385']
and i like you as a friend. joey: right.:::['9-6-387']
see you later. chandler: see you.:::['9-6-388']
did the guy really make that joke? no, he still kills me.:::['9-6-389']
last night he had me laughing so hard, i swear, a little pee came out.:::['9-6-390']
i can't watch. it's like firing elmo.:::['9-6-392']
sandy? hi.:::['9-6-393']
hi. we, uh...:::['9-6-394']
we kind of need to talk.:::['9-6-395', '7-5-295']
i'm afraid it's not working out.:::['9-6-396']
oh. yeah, um...:::['9-6-397']
i mean, rachel and i think you are great with emma. um...:::['9-6-398']
we just feel... rachel: you. you feel.:::['9-6-399']
i just feel......that the chemistry isn't right.:::['9-6-400']
we're more than happy to give you a good recommendation.:::['9-6-402']
no, that's okay. i had a lot of offers from other families.:::['9-6-403']
i just picked you guys because......i liked you the best.:::['9-6-404']
rachel: oh, damn you, geller.:::['9-6-405']
anyway, uh, well, i'm glad there's no hard feelings.:::['9-6-406']
no, none at all. you need to be happy with whoever is in your home.:::['9-6-407']
although, if you don't mind telling me......what was the problem? maybe it's:::['9-6-408']
something i can work on in the future.:::['9-6-409']
no, you know, it's, uh, nothing you did. it's... it's, uh, my issue.:::['9-6-410']
uh, heh...:::['9-6-412']
please?:::['9-6-413', '10-12-309', '10-9-246', '10-9-368', '5-2-223', '4-14-301']
you know, i'm just not, um, that comfortable... ...with a guy who's as sensitive as you.:::['9-6-414']
that's fair.:::['9-6-415']
although, can i ask, why do you think that is?:::['9-6-416']
um... uh...:::['9-6-418']
maybe because of my father?:::['9-6-419']
i mean, uh, you know, when i was growing up, he was a tough guy.:::['9-6-421']
you know, and as a kid, i wasn't the athlete i am now.:::['9-6-422']
i play squash.:::['9-6-423']
anyway, i, uh... i always got the feeling he thought i was too sensitive.:::['9-6-424']
that must have been hard.:::['9-6-425']
it was hard.:::['9-6-426']
i remember i was in my bedroom, playing with my dinosaurs...:::['9-6-427']
playing and learning.:::['9-6-428']
and my father walks in and says, "what are you doing with those things?:::['9-6-429']
what's wrong with you? why aren't you outside playing like a real boy?":::['9-6-430']
but you are a real boy. i know i am.:::['9-6-431']
and when it's summer and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?:::['9-6-432']
it's all right. crying is good. it lets the boo-hoos out.:::['9-6-433']
here comes some more.:::['9-6-434']
and what's the one kind of boat that can never ever sink?:::['9-6-435']
what kind? a friend ship.:::['9-6-436']
wow. you blow my mind.:::['9-6-437']
oh, i gotta go. aw.:::['9-6-438']
how much do i owe you? twenty bucks.:::['9-6-439']
it's like the cheapest college ever.:::['9-6-440']
and that's why, no matter what mommy says......we really were on a break.:::['9-7-0']
yes, we were.:::['9-7-1']
yes, we were. heh. come here, gorgeous.:::['9-7-2']
look at you. you are the cutest little baby ever.:::['9-7-3']
you're just a little-bitty baby, you know that? but you've got...:::['9-7-4']
you've got big, beautiful eyes.:::['9-7-5']
yes, you do. and a... and a big, round belly.:::['9-7-6']
big baby butt.:::['9-7-7']
i like big butts.:::['9-7-8']
i like big butts and i cannot lie:::['9-7-9', '9-7-229', '9-7-330']
you other brothers can't deny:::['9-7-10', '9-7-224', '9-7-230']
when a girl walks in with an itty-bitty waist:::['9-7-11', '9-7-225']
and a round thing in your face you get...:::['9-7-12']
oh, my god, emma. you're laughing.:::['9-7-13']
oh, my god. you've never done that before, have you?:::['9-7-14']
you've never done that before. daddy made you laugh, huh?:::['9-7-15']
well, daddy and sir mix-a-lot.:::['9-7-16']
what? what? you wanna hear some more? um...:::['9-7-17']
my anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun:::['9-7-18']
i'm a terrible father. oh.:::['9-7-19']
hey. hey, listen.:::['9-7-20']
what do you know about investments? how come?:::['9-7-21']
i'm starting to make good money on the show, and i should do something with it.:::['9-7-22']
what do you do with your money now? it's taped to the back of my toilet tank.:::['9-7-23']
i didn't say that. it's in a bank guarded by robots.:::['9-7-24']
do you have any ideas? uh, this guy at work got me excited......about going in on an emu farm.:::['9-7-25']
that'd be kind of cool, huh?:::['9-7-26']
pitching in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus.:::['9-7-27']
joe, emus are birds. you raise them for meat.:::['9-7-28']
yeah. right!:::['9-7-29']
people eat birds. bird meat.:::['9-7-30']
do they just fly into your mouth? or you go in a restaurant and say::::['9-7-31']
"excuse me, i'll have a bucket of fried bird." ha-ha-ha.:::['9-7-32']
or maybe just a wing. or a...:::['9-7-33']
monica: mm-hm. joey: ahem.:::['9-7-34']
you should consider something a little less risky.:::['9-7-35']
i think real estate is your best investment.:::['9-7-36']
the fed just lowered the rates, and the interest on your mortgage is deductible.:::['9-7-37']
that's right. i know some stuff.:::['9-7-38']
real estate, huh? hmm.:::['9-7-39']
oh! and you know who's selling a great apartment? richard!:::['9-7-40']
oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!:::['9-7-41']
my dad told me. they play golf together. oh! well, maybe i'll join them sometime.:::['9-7-42']
i just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand......and beat the mustache:::['9-7-43']
off his face.:::['9-7-44']
hi! you have to help me pick a dress. i'm meeting mike's parents tonight.:::['9-7-45']
wow, the boyfriend's parents. big step.:::['9-7-46']
really? that hadn't occurred to me. they'll love you. just be yourself.:::['9-7-47']
they live on the upper east side on park avenue.:::['9-7-48']
oh, yeah, she can't be herself. phoebe: ugh.:::['9-7-49']
okay, so, all right, which dress?:::['9-7-50']
you can say neither. rachel & monica: oh, god. neither.:::['9-7-51']
i'm sorry. we'll take you shopping. it'll be fine.:::['9-7-52']
you are in such good hands, and i am so good with meeting parents.:::['9-7-53']
with the father, you wanna flirt a little, but not in a gross way.:::['9-7-54']
phoebe: uh-huh.:::['9-7-55']
just kind of like, "mr. pinzer, i can see where wallace gets his good looks.":::['9-7-56']
you went out with wallace pinzer? oh, he took the sats for me.:::['9-7-57']
i knew you didn't get a 1400! yeah, well, duh! i mean...:::['9-7-58']
so now, what about with mike's mom?:::['9-7-59']
oh! well, with the mother... ...just constantly tell her how amazing her son is.:::['9-7-60']
take it from me. moms love me. ross' mom one time actually said......i am like the daughter:::['9-7-61']
that she never had.:::['9-7-62']
she said what? she's like the daughter she never had.:::['9-7-63']
listen.:::['9-7-64', '10-11-221', '4-8-289']
i just got phoebe all dressed to meet mike's parents.:::['9-7-66']
she's so nervous. it's so sweet.:::['9-7-67']
guess what. i made emma laugh today.:::['9-7-68']
you what? and i missed it......because i was giving a makeover:::['9-7-69']
to that stupid hippie?:::['9-7-70']
yeah, and it was, uh, like, uh, a real little person laugh too.:::['9-7-71']
oh! it was like, um::::['9-7-72']
only not creepy.:::['9-7-73']
what did you do to make her laugh? i, um...:::['9-7-75']
well, i sang. actually......i rapped, um, heh......"baby got back.":::['9-7-76']
you sang to our baby daughter......a song about a guy:::['9-7-78']
who likes to have sex......with women with giant asses?:::['9-7-79']
you know what, if you think about it......it actually promotes:::['9-7-80']
a healthy, uh, body image......because even big butts......or, uh, "juicy doubles" are...:::['9-7-81']
please don't take her away from me.:::['9-7-83']
oh, hi, come on in. i'm catherine, the listing agent.:::['9-7-84']
hi, i'm joey. this is chandler.:::['9-7-85']
so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt?:::['9-7-86']
medical malpractice? choked on his own mustache?:::['9-7-87']
he's buying a much bigger place. it's got a great view of central park...:::['9-7-88']
that's enough out of you.:::['9-7-89']
uh, is there anything we should know about the place?:::['9-7-90']
all the appliances are included. there's a lot of light, a new kitchen.:::['9-7-91']
i think you guys would be very happy here.:::['9-7-92']
chandler: ha. no, no, no. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-7-93']
no, we're not together. we're definitely not a couple.:::['9-7-94']
oh, okay. sorry. joey: that's all right.:::['9-7-95']
wow, you, uh, seemed pretty insulted by that.:::['9-7-96']
what, i'm not good enough for you?:::['9-7-97']
we are not gonna have this conversation again.:::['9-7-98']
look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy?:::['9-7-99']
pretentious art. this huge, macho couch.:::['9-7-100']
when we know all he does is sit around......crying about losing monica:::['9-7-101']
to a real man. ha, ha.:::['9-7-102']
you don't think he's here, do you? i don't know.:::['9-7-103']
it's a nice place, but i gotta say, i don't know if i see myself living here.:::['9-7-104']
well, let me see.:::['9-7-105']
yeah, i can see it.:::['9-7-106']
look at these videos. i mean, who does he think he is?:::['9-7-107']
magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke.:::['9-7-108']
there's a tape here with monica's name on it.:::['9-7-110']
ooh. a tape with a girl's name on it. it's probably a sex tape.:::['9-7-111']
this says "monica.":::['9-7-113']
and this is richard's apartment.:::['9-7-114']
get there faster!:::['9-7-115']
wow. you look......like my mom.:::['9-7-116']
i'm wearing pantyhose.:::['9-7-117']
great! come on in. okay.:::['9-7-118']
ha-ha-ha. hi. hi.:::['9-7-119']
oh. thank you.:::['9-7-120']
oh, my god. you're rich. no, my parents are rich.:::['9-7-122']
so? they gotta die someday. hello!:::['9-7-123']
mom, dad, this is phoebe.:::['9-7-124']
phoebe, these are my parents, theodore and bitsy.:::['9-7-125']
theodore, bitsy......what a delight.:::['9-7-126']
theodore: ha-ha-ha.:::['9-7-127']
it's so nice to finally meet you. and you.:::['9-7-128']
your home is lovely.:::['9-7-129']
thank you. i'll give you a tour later. it's actually three floors.:::['9-7-130']
holy crap!:::['9-7-131']
oh. why don't you come meet our friends?:::['9-7-132']
try and stop me.:::['9-7-133']
hey. what are you doing? getting your parents to like me.:::['9-7-134']
i'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this.:::['9-7-135']
i want them to get to know phoebe, not: "phoebe.":::['9-7-136']
it's hard to stop. mm.:::['9-7-137']
well, come on.:::['9-7-138']
phoebe, these are our friends tom and sue engel.:::['9-7-139']
phoebe, come sit. tell us a little bit about yourself.:::['9-7-140']
so where are you from?:::['9-7-142']
well, all right. um, originally, i'm from upstate......but, um, then my mom killed herself,and my stepdad went to prison.:::['9-7-143']
so i moved to the city... ...where, um, i lived in a burned-out buick lesabre for a while.:::['9-7-144']
which was okay. that was okay.:::['9-7-145']
until, um, i got hepatitis, you know......because this pimp spit:::['9-7-146']
in my mouth and...:::['9-7-147']
but i got over it.:::['9-7-148']
and, um, anyway, now i'm a, um, freelance massage therapist......um, which isn't always steady money,but at least i don't pay taxes.:::['9-7-149']
so where does everyone summer?:::['9-7-150']
oh, god, this is not going well. no, you're doing fine. really.:::['9-7-151']
why don't you go talk to my dad? okay, okay, okay.:::['9-7-152']
still sure about me being myself? absolutely.:::['9-7-153']
though maybe just a little less "pimp spit.":::['9-7-154']
so, theodore, i, uh, can see where mike gets his good looks from.:::['9-7-156']
oh. well...:::['9-7-157']
you must work out all the time. oh, not all the time. i do the best i can.:::['9-7-158']
yeah, i bet. look out! oh! ow.:::['9-7-159']
oh, my god. are you okay? unh! i recently had surgery.:::['9-7-160']
i'm so sorry. no, i'll be fine.:::['9-7-161']
i just should check the stitches. i really am sorry.:::['9-7-162']
how could you know? why wouldn't you punch me in the stomach?:::['9-7-163']
did you just hit my dad?:::['9-7-165']
yes. i'm sorry. i've never met a boyfriend's parents before.:::['9-7-166']
but, i mean, you have met humans before, right?:::['9-7-167']
why don't you go talk to my mom?:::['9-7-168']
okay, yeah, your mom. she looks nice. i can talk to her.:::['9-7-169']
you do that, and i'm gonna go check my dad for signs of internal bleeding.:::['9-7-170']
oh, bitsy? um, uh, listen, i wanted to thank you again... ...for having me here tonight.:::['9-7-171']
well, not at all.:::['9-7-172']
also, um, i just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.:::['9-7-173']
thank you. i think so too. it's a testament to how he was raised.:::['9-7-174']
especially to you, because he's very respectful of women.:::['9-7-175']
is he really? he is so considerate of my feelings.:::['9-7-176']
you know, i think you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.:::['9-7-177']
no, don't get me wrong. no, not in like a sissy way.:::['9-7-179']
when he gets going......he can rattle a headboard:::['9-7-180']
like a sailor on leave.:::['9-7-181']
that's... my boy.:::['9-7-182']
i'm not gonna watch it. i don't need to watch it.:::['9-7-184']
i mean, what good could possibly come from watching it?:::['9-7-185']
well, we know i'm gonna watch it.:::['9-7-186']
hey, dude, what's up? don't judge me! i'm only human!:::['9-7-187']
did you take that tape?:::['9-7-188']
i had to! imagine you were married and you found a tape of your wife......in another guy's apartment. wouldn't:::['9-7-189']
you need to know what was on it?:::['9-7-190']
i don't know. who am i married to?:::['9-7-191']
some girl.:::['9-7-192']
she hot?:::['9-7-193']
yeah. how did she get me to settle down?:::['9-7-194']
all right, i'm gonna watch it.:::['9-7-195']
i mean, it's probably not even what i think it is.:::['9-7-196']
even if it is, it can't possibly be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head.:::['9-7-197']
ha, ha. can it?:::['9-7-198']
see, in my experience, if a girl says yes to being taped......she doesn't say no to much else,i'll tell you.:::['9-7-199']
then you have to watch it for me. whoa! what?:::['9-7-200']
just for a few seconds so i can know what it is. please?:::['9-7-201']
all right, fine. but if i enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame!:::['9-7-202']
why am i hearing cheering? it's okay. it's just a football game.:::['9-7-203']
it's just football? you were all worried for nothing.:::['9-7-204']
it's football! it's just football!:::['9-7-205']
this is great! this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football!:::['9-7-206']
i think it may be customary to get a beer!:::['9-7-207']
what the?:::['9-7-208']
what are you doing? you don't wanna see what i just saw!:::['9-7-209']
oh, my god! is that richard?:::['9-7-211']
okay, uh, please laugh for mommy. please?:::['9-7-212']
please laugh for mommy.:::['9-7-213']
not funny, huh?:::['9-7-214']
well, so is it......only offensive novelty rap?:::['9-7-215']
or maybe just, you know, rap in general. because mommy can rap.:::['9-7-216']
my name is mommy and i'm here to say:::['9-7-217']
that all the babies are...:::['9-7-218']
oh, i can't rap.:::['9-7-219']
all right, sweetheart. this is only because i love you so much.:::['9-7-220']
and i know that you're not gonna tell anybody.:::['9-7-221']
i like:::['9-7-222']
big butts and i cannot lie:::['9-7-223']
and a round thing in your face:::['9-7-226']
yes, yes, yes. yes! ha!:::['9-7-227']
oh, emma, you're laughing! oh, you are!:::['9-7-231']
you really do like big butts, don't you?:::['9-7-232']
oh, you beautiful little weirdo.:::['9-7-233']
hey. oh, you missed it! she was laughing!:::['9-7-235']
oh, it was amazing. oh.:::['9-7-236']
it was amazing. it was the most beautiful, beautiful sound.:::['9-7-237']
oh, i know, isn't it?:::['9-7-238']
oh, what did you do to get her to laugh?:::['9-7-239']
oh, you know, i just... a couple of things i tried. different...:::['9-7-240']
just sang a little "the ltsy-bitsy spider.":::['9-7-241']
you sang "baby got back," didn't you?:::['9-7-242']
nothing else worked! that girl is all about the ass!:::['9-7-243']
and then it goes back to the chorus.:::['9-7-244']
smelly cat, smelly cat:::['9-7-245', '2-17-129', '2-17-140', '2-17-216', '2-17-220', '2-17-225', '2-17-354', '2-6-351', '2-6-354', '2-6-355', '2-6-367', '4-5-54', '3-14-197', '3-14-199']
it's not your fault:::['9-7-246', '2-17-144', '2-17-217', '2-17-226', '2-17-358', '2-6-368', '3-14-200']
resolve. and that's the end of the song.:::['9-7-247']
i realize you hadn't asked to hear it......but, um, no one had spoken:::['9-7-248']
in 17 minutes.:::['9-7-249']
uh, phoebe writes lots of songs. what was that one you sang the other night?:::['9-7-250']
oh, "pervert parade"?:::['9-7-251']
oh! "ode to a pubic hair"? stop.:::['9-7-253']
oh, god. is that veal?:::['9-7-254']
mom, i thought i told you, phoebe's a vegetarian.:::['9-7-255']
no, that's okay. that's okay. i mean, i am a vegetarian......except for veal.:::['9-7-257']
yeah. no. veal i love. heh.:::['9-7-258']
phoebe, you don't have to eat that. any baby animals. kittens, fish babies.:::['9-7-259']
but, you know, especially veal.:::['9-7-260']
you know, and this nice vein of fat running through it.:::['9-7-261']
mm. yummy. theodore: ha-ha-ha.:::['9-7-262']
so you stole that tape from richard's apartment?:::['9-7-265']
listen to the judgment from the porn star!:::['9-7-266']
that tape was never meant to be seen by...:::['9-7-267']
joey, i would feel more comfortable if this conversation were in private.:::['9-7-268']
ha, ha, monica, look, i don't think you and i have any secrets anymore.:::['9-7-269']
not ready to joke about it yet? see you later.:::['9-7-270']
why in the world would you take this tape? and why would you watch it?:::['9-7-271']
because that's who i am. okay?:::['9-7-272']
i'm sure a man like richard could see a tape like that and not be bothered.:::['9-7-273']
it'd just be another saucy anecdote......for him to share at his men's club:::['9-7-274']
over brandy and mustaches.:::['9-7-275']
is all of this about you not being able to grow a mustache?:::['9-7-276']
this is about you and richard. he's clearly not over you.:::['9-7-277']
he keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants.:::['9-7-278']
isn't that sad? can't you see how pathetic that is?:::['9-7-279']
don't be jealous. you should feel bad for him.:::['9-7-280']
oh, yeah, well, poor richard, he...:::['9-7-281']
i can grow a mustache.:::['9-7-282']
this is not our problem. we have each other. that's all that matters.:::['9-7-283']
but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him, with your......cowboy boots in the air.:::['9-7-284']
cowboy boots? i've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life.:::['9-7-285']
oh, good, good. play more because i wanna see how it ends.:::['9-7-286']
that's not me! what?:::['9-7-287']
that's not you! life is good again!:::['9-7-288']
ride 'em, cowgirl!:::['9-7-289']
that bastard taped over me!:::['9-7-290']
is that a problem?:::['9-7-291']
it's just so insulting. spring for a new blank tape, doctor!:::['9-7-292']
i can't imagine what he sees in her.:::['9-7-293']
she actually makes me miss that pill-popping ex-wife of his.:::['9-7-294']
hello, dear. hey.:::['9-7-295']
what's going on? we were just chitchatting.:::['9-7-296']
how's your friend? a little better.:::['9-7-297']
do you know who's moving back into town? tom and sue's daughter, jen.:::['9-7-298']
you remember her, michael. she's lovely, well-behaved and single.:::['9-7-299']
i'm not interested. oh, please, darling, let's be honest.:::['9-7-300']
you can have all the sailor fun you want with that one.:::['9-7-301']
but let's be real. all right, stop.:::['9-7-302']
all phoebe has done is try and get you to like her. maybe it's not clear......but she did her best.:::['9-7-303']
she's a little different than you are. michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.:::['9-7-304']
mike: so what? if i can get past that, it shouldn't bother you.:::['9-7-305']
you don't have to like her. just accept the fact that i do.:::['9-7-306']
if you can't even be civil to the woman i love...:::['9-7-307']
the woman you what? yeah, the woman you what?:::['9-7-308']
the woman i love.:::['9-7-309']
something i shouldn't say for the first time, in front of my parents......and tom and sue.:::['9-7-311']
who are, by the way, the most sinfully boring people i've ever met in my life.:::['9-7-312']
i love you too. you do?:::['9-7-313']
wanna get out of here? okay.:::['9-7-316']
mom, dad. thanks for dinner. i had a great time.:::['9-7-317']
it was really top-drawer. and here's something rich.:::['9-7-318']
thirteen bathrooms in this place, i threw up in the coat closet.:::['9-7-319']
ta-ta!:::['9-7-320']
she's sweat, wet:::['9-7-321']
got it going like a turbo 'vette:::['9-7-322']
so, fellas! yeah? fellas! yeah?:::['9-7-323']
has your girlfriend got the butt? hell, yeah:::['9-7-324']
so shake it shake it:::['9-7-325']
shake it shake it:::['9-7-326']
shake that nasty butt:::['9-7-327']
baby got back:::['9-7-328']
one more time from the top!:::['9-7-329']
you other brothers...:::['9-7-331']
rachel, please! that is so inappropriate!:::['9-7-332']
oh, hey, you guys?:::['9-5-0']
i couldn't get a reservation for the night of my birthday......so we'll have to do dinner:::['9-5-1']
thursday night instead.:::['9-5-2']
thursday? but that's halloween. phoebe: so?:::['9-5-3']
it's just spooky, that's all.:::['9-5-4']
uh, so is mike coming to dinner?:::['9-5-5']
no. it's my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work.:::['9-5-6']
i'd get mad at him, but i think it's too soon to show my true colors.:::['9-5-7']
well, i would make the reservation for five. one of us has to stay home and watch emma.:::['9-5-8']
which one of us should go to dinner? oh, rachel.:::['9-5-9']
uh, actually, i was thinking maybe both of us could go.:::['9-5-10']
oh, yay.:::['9-5-11']
thanks. i'll put a lot of extra thought into your gift.:::['9-5-12']
all right, so great, we can all go now.:::['9-5-13']
that is fun. hey. you know what?:::['9-5-14']
we all haven't been together, the six of us, in such a long time.:::['9-5-15']
what are you talking about? we're all together now.:::['9-5-16']
uh, mon? chandler's not here.:::['9-5-17']
hello, everyone. it's nice to see our team together for the first time.:::['9-5-19']
now, before we get started, are there any questions?:::['9-5-20']
yes. ken, is it? ken: that's right.:::['9-5-21']
is it true the reason you're in tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting......and took the job without realizing:::['9-5-22']
what you were saying yes to?:::['9-5-23']
well, don't believe everything you hear, ken.:::['9-5-24']
but yeah, that's true.:::['9-5-25']
all right, let's get started by, uh, taking a look at last quarter's figures.:::['9-5-26']
uh, claudia, aren't you supposed to blow smoke up the boss's ass?:::['9-5-27']
i'm sorry. does the smoke bother you? no. i smoked for years. then i quit.:::['9-5-28']
right now, i can't remember why.:::['9-5-29']
you're not allowed to smoke in this office though, right?:::['9-5-30']
yes, in oklahoma it's legal to smoke in offices with 15 people or less.:::['9-5-31']
would you like one? all right, look. i don't smoke anymore.:::['9-5-32']
but if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, it's fine.:::['9-5-33']
so you all smoke, then? heh.:::['9-5-34']
you know, it's almost rude that i'm not smoking.:::['9-5-35']
that's not true. if you don't wanna smoke... ken, please!:::['9-5-36']
no, i can't. i can't smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me.:::['9-5-37']
i'm sorry, but isn't your wife back in new york?:::['9-5-38']
i've always liked you, ken.:::['9-5-39']
phoebe: trick or treat.:::['9-5-40']
monica: hey. ooh, and "treat" it is.:::['9-5-41']
wow. so glad i changed.:::['9-5-42']
i almost wore my threadbare robe that can't contain my breasts.:::['9-5-43']
this is not what i'm wearing. i'm ovulating......and chandler's gonna be home.:::['9-5-44']
so i thought we would try before dinner.:::['9-5-45']
oh. wait, does that...? you guys won't be late for my dinner, will you?:::['9-5-46']
chandler and i have not seen each other in over a week.:::['9-5-47']
we'll probably be the first ones there.:::['9-5-48']
okay. see you there. happy humping.:::['9-5-49']
hey. well, hey.:::['9-5-50']
oh. wow, somebody smoked out here?:::['9-5-51']
my god, don't people know you're not allowed to smoke in public spaces?:::['9-5-52']
actually, in oklahoma, smoking is legal in offices with fewer than 15 people.:::['9-5-53']
oh, you smoked.:::['9-5-54']
no. i just happen to know a lot of trivia about smoking in different states.:::['9-5-55']
for example, in hawaii, cigarettes are called lei-lana-lukus.:::['9-5-56']
oh, chandler, you stink of cigarettes. do you think monica is gonna smell it?:::['9-5-57']
are you kidding? that woman has the nose of a bloodhound.:::['9-5-58']
and the breasts of a greek goddess.:::['9-5-59']
i'm gonna go.:::['9-5-61', '2-21-274']
okay. something to cover the smell.:::['9-5-62']
oven cleaner.:::['9-5-63']
unscented.:::['9-5-64']
monica: welcome home.:::['9-5-65']
i've missed you.:::['9-5-66']
you wanna join me in the bedroom? no, thanks, i'm good.:::['9-5-67']
oh, okay. so you want to play it that way, do you?:::['9-5-68']
well, uh, you know what? actually, i just got off a plane......so i'm feeling gross.:::['9-5-69']
maybe i should take a shower.:::['9-5-70']
come here, you don't need a shower. all right, the truth is......i soiled myself:::['9-5-71']
during some turbulence.:::['9-5-72']
what do i smell? i smell smoke.:::['9-5-73']
did you smoke?:::['9-5-74', '7-9-309']
yes. but i just had one.:::['9-5-75']
two.:::['9-5-76', '3-19-36']
two tiny cigarettes. okay, five.:::['9-5-77']
a pack. two pack... a carton.:::['9-5-78']
three big fat cartons in two days.:::['9-5-79']
but it's over. i've made a decision, i'm not gonna smoke anymore.:::['9-5-80']
well, those are for you.:::['9-5-81']
all right. well, we'll just, uh, see you when you get here. bye.:::['9-5-82']
oh, that was my mom. she's stuck in terrible traffic.:::['9-5-83']
okay, well, that is now the third sign that i should not leave emma.:::['9-5-84']
what are the other two? well, the first one is, i don't want to.:::['9-5-85']
and second one, i'm not going.:::['9-5-86']
i know this is the first time we're leaving the baby.:::['9-5-87']
hey, i know how hard it is for you. but...:::['9-5-88']
but everything's gonna be fine. i mean, my mom is gonna be with her.:::['9-5-89']
she's great with kids. she is?:::['9-5-90']
what about monica?:::['9-5-92']
hey, you only hear monica's side of that. okay, that little fatso was a terror.:::['9-5-93']
i just don't think i can do it. you know what? you can and you should.:::['9-5-94']
really, it'll be good for you.:::['9-5-95']
in fact, you know what?:::['9-5-96']
why don't you go ahead to the restaurant, and i will wait for my mom......and then i'll meet you there?:::['9-5-97']
no, no, really, you should go. go out.:::['9-5-98']
really, the world is your oyster. kick up your heels. paint the town red.:::['9-5-99']
you need to learn some new slang. i'm serious. come on, you should go.:::['9-5-100']
here. no, just go.:::['9-5-101']
well... oh! no, no. you know what?:::['9-5-102']
you're not getting back in there. the baby's fine. now, scram.:::['9-5-103']
yeah, tell your story walking.:::['9-5-104']
i was just going to say that i left my keys.:::['9-5-105']
holy moley, are we in a pickle now.:::['9-5-107']
where is everyone? they're 40 minutes late.:::['9-5-108']
i know. i'm starving.:::['9-5-109']
i knew we were coming here tonight. i ate nothing all day.:::['9-5-110']
what about me? i only had one lunch today.:::['9-5-111']
so are we expecting the rest of our party shortly?:::['9-5-112']
yes, they are expected presently. yeah.:::['9-5-113']
their, um... their arrival is in the offing.:::['9-5-114']
right. we do have a table for two available.:::['9-5-115']
perhaps you'd be... no, they're coming.:::['9-5-116']
we're waiting right here.:::['9-5-117']
joseph.:::['9-5-118', '10-12-227']
one needn't worry. they shan't be long.:::['9-5-119']
it's just that we do have some large parties waiting.:::['9-5-120']
oh, one really does have a stick up one's ass, doesn't one?:::['9-5-121']
how can you smoke in this day and age? have you not seen that ad? huh?:::['9-5-122']
where the little kid walks through grandpa? it's chilling.:::['9-5-123']
i messed up. it was a meeting. everybody was smoking.:::['9-5-124']
so what? don't you have any willpower?:::['9-5-125']
willpower? i've watched home movies of you eating ding dongs......without taking the tinfoil off.:::['9-5-126']
you said that was sexy.:::['9-5-127']
okay, look, can we just drop this? i'm not gonna smoke again.:::['9-5-128']
that's right, because i forbid you to smoke again.:::['9-5-129']
you forbid me? mm-hm.:::['9-5-130']
you know, i've flown a long way to see my loving wife.:::['9-5-131']
is she here, by the way?:::['9-5-132']
chandler, don't joke with me. okay? i'm very, very upset right now.:::['9-5-133']
oh. would you say this is the most upset you could be? i think so.:::['9-5-134']
well, then i might as well......do this.:::['9-5-135']
not really sure what to do now.:::['9-5-136']
i'll tell you what we're gonna do.:::['9-5-137']
we're already late for phoebe's birthday dinner.:::['9-5-138']
so you're going to put out that cigarette......we're gonna put this fight on hold,and go have sex.:::['9-5-139']
fine. what?:::['9-5-140']
sex. this is the last day i'm ovulating. if we don't do it......we're gonna have to wait:::['9-5-141']
until next month.:::['9-5-142']
you're serious?:::['9-5-143']
oh, yeah. all right, fine, i'll do it, but no talking.:::['9-5-144']
and no cuddling. and no kissing your neck.:::['9-5-145']
oh, good. i hate it when you do that.:::['9-5-146']
and lots of kissing your neck.:::['9-5-147']
okay, well, the super's not home.:::['9-5-148']
but my mother's gonna be here, and she has the key.:::['9-5-149']
i can't wait that long. you have to do something. knock that door down.:::['9-5-150']
i would, but i bruise like a peach.:::['9-5-151']
besides, you know, everything's gonna be fine. the baby's sleeping.:::['9-5-152']
what if she jumps out of the bassinet? can't hold her own head up. but, yeah, jumped.:::['9-5-153']
oh, my god. i left the water running.:::['9-5-154']
you did not leave the water running. please, pull yourself together, okay?:::['9-5-155']
well, did i leave the stove on? you haven't cooked since 1996.:::['9-5-156']
is the window open? if the window's open a bird could fly in and...:::['9-5-157']
oh, my god, you know what? i think you're right.:::['9-5-158']
listen. what? what?:::['9-5-159']
a pigeon. no. no, wait, no. an eagle flew in.:::['9-5-160']
landed on the stove and caught fire.:::['9-5-161']
the baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid.:::['9-5-162']
the eagle, however, misconstrues this as an act of aggression......and grabs the baby in its talon.:::['9-5-163']
meanwhile, the faucet fills the apartment with water.:::['9-5-164']
baby and bird, still ablaze, are locked in a death grip......swirling around the whirlpool:::['9-5-165']
that fills the apartment.:::['9-5-166']
boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.:::['9-5-167']
hello. both: hi.:::['9-5-168']
it's been an hour.:::['9-5-169']
the maitre d' asked if you'd reconsider switching to a smaller table.:::['9-5-170']
maybe we should just eat now.:::['9-5-171']
you can't order until the entire party's arrived. restaurant policy.:::['9-5-172']
well, how about this? another table leaves, right......but there's still some food left:::['9-5-173']
on their plates.:::['9-5-174']
okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eating that?:::['9-5-175']
it's frowned upon. but it happens.:::['9-5-176']
all right, i gotta go to the bathroom. no, you can't go.:::['9-5-177']
no, no, no. i can't hold this table on my own.:::['9-5-178']
if they ask me to move, i'll cave.:::['9-5-179']
well, if you ask me to stay, i'll pee.:::['9-5-180']
good evening, miss.:::['9-5-181']
miss?:::['9-5-182']
miss? miss?:::['9-5-183']
okay, fine, i'll move. all right. you don't have to manhandle me.:::['9-5-184']
where? okay.:::['9-5-185']
finally, you guys made it.:::['9-5-188']
pheebs, who the hell...? ah!:::['9-5-189']
spend more time with the tie. that'll make a baby.:::['9-5-190']
look, i can't do this. i can't make love to you while we're fighting this way.:::['9-5-191']
oh, sure. now you're mr. sensitivity.:::['9-5-192']
but when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral...:::['9-5-193']
that was a celebration of life.:::['9-5-194']
all right, look, i'm not gonna do this.:::['9-5-195']
is this the way you want our baby to be conceived?:::['9-5-196']
no, you're right.:::['9-5-197']
yeah, we shouldn't do it like this.:::['9-5-198']
for what it's worth, i'm sorry.:::['9-5-199']
i shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking.:::['9-5-200']
so you had a few cigarettes. it's not the end of the world.:::['9-5-201']
you are incredible.:::['9-5-203']
and listen, i'm not gonna smoke again.:::['9-5-204']
and if i do, i promise i will hide it so much better from you.:::['9-5-205']
do you want to? yeah, let's celebrate life.:::['9-5-206']
rachel: oh, god.:::['9-5-208']
oh, thank god you're okay.:::['9-5-209']
i'm sorry we left you. mommy will never leave you again.:::['9-5-210']
never, ever, ever again.:::['9-5-211']
great. so let's get going.:::['9-5-212']
oh, no. i mean it. after what just happened, i'm never leaving her again.:::['9-5-213']
i understand. separation is hard.:::['9-5-214']
one time i was about to leave ross to go to the beauty parlor.:::['9-5-215']
and he got so upset he took off all his clothes......tucked his willy between his legs......and cried out,"mommy, i'm a girl. take me with you.":::['9-5-216']
somehow, over time, it got easier to be apart from you.:::['9-5-217']
chandler: ah.:::['9-5-218']
you are welcome.:::['9-5-219']
you know what? let's not talk. what?:::['9-5-220']
i am still so mad at you for smoking. but you said you forgave me.:::['9-5-221']
it was just a couple of cigarettes, no big deal.:::['9-5-222']
oh, blah-blah-blah-blah.:::['9-5-223']
i was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me if we were fighting.:::['9-5-224']
you tricked me to get me into bed? that's right. i got mine.:::['9-5-225']
i feel so used.:::['9-5-226']
well, i guess they're not coming. you want to just order?:::['9-5-227']
waiter? all right, this is gonna go fast, so try to keep up.:::['9-5-229']
risotto with shaved truffles and the rib steak......with the golden chanterelles:::['9-5-230']
and the bordelaise sauce......unless any of that stuff i just said:::['9-5-231']
means "snails.":::['9-5-232']
it does not. tomato tart......and, um, which of the pastas:::['9-5-233']
would you recommend?:::['9-5-234']
oh, well, they're both exquis... both it is. thank you.:::['9-5-235']
oh, uh, can i make a special request?:::['9-5-236']
can you bring everything as soon as it's ready?:::['9-5-237']
appetizers, entrées, we don't care.:::['9-5-238']
ross: hey. rachel: hi. hi.:::['9-5-239']
i'll just wait to put your order in. you guys are over an hour late.:::['9-5-240']
what happened to you two? ross: so sorry.:::['9-5-241']
we got locked out of the apartment. that's a great story. can i eat it?:::['9-5-242']
and then rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.:::['9-5-243']
it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and i did what i had to do.:::['9-5-244']
and that's judy over there at the bar with emma?:::['9-5-245']
this is for the best. i'm not distracted, worrying about emma......how she's doing at home, and i'm:::['9-5-246']
gonna be completely here with you.:::['9-5-247']
oh, she spit up. what?:::['9-5-248']
she spit up. judy? she spit... judy, look alive, judy.:::['9-5-249']
rachel: thank you. thanks.:::['9-5-250', '5-7-47']
ross: ooh. whew, everything looks delicious.:::['9-5-251']
what should i have? what should i have?:::['9-5-252']
never hit a woman. never hit a woman.:::['9-5-253']
i know what you mean, this looks incredible.:::['9-5-254']
ross bruises like a peach. he bruises like a peach.:::['9-5-255']
okay, i'll have the fig salad and the duck.:::['9-5-256']
i'll have the, uh, soup and the salmon.:::['9-5-257']
remember, whatever comes up first, okay?:::['9-5-258']
and hurry... happy birthday.:::['9-5-259']
son of a bitch.:::['9-5-260']
where have you been? well, we had a little fight.:::['9-5-261']
i would never lie to get someone into bed.:::['9-5-262']
you used to tell girls you were a kennedy.:::['9-5-263']
thanks. wow.:::['9-5-265']
a little tight, isn't it? why didn't you get a bigger table?:::['9-5-266']
you had a big table but they made you move.:::['9-5-267']
ha, ha. shut up, monica.:::['9-5-268']
oh, well, i suppose that chandler will have the smoked duck.:::['9-5-269']
and i suppose that monica will have the manipulative shrew.:::['9-5-270']
i'll give you another minute. what, where you going?:::['9-5-271']
he said she wanted the shrew.:::['9-5-272']
rach, come on, emma's fine.:::['9-5-273']
you're turning into an obsessive mother, okay? you need to stop.:::['9-5-274']
you guys ever hear the story about when ross' mom went to the beauty salon?:::['9-5-275']
you mean the willy story? ha, ha. they already know it.:::['9-5-276']
we've been waiting for you for a long time.:::['9-5-277']
maybe you should order. that's okay.:::['9-5-278']
i told the waiter what they want. why would you do that?:::['9-5-279']
chandler, control your woman.:::['9-5-280']
okay, well... everybody has ordered.:::['9-5-281']
i would like to start the celebration and make a toast to phoebe.:::['9-5-282']
she dropped her sock. aw. what?:::['9-5-283']
no. no, emma dropped her sock. monica: mom's here?:::['9-5-284']
i wanted to have lunch with her today. she told me she was out of town.:::['9-5-285']
ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.:::['9-5-286']
it's a good toast.:::['9-5-287']
look, will you please get her attention?:::['9-5-288']
mommy?:::['9-5-289']
oh, for god's sake, judy, pick up the sock.:::['9-5-290']
pick up the sock! pick up the sock!:::['9-5-291']
i'm sorry, was that rude?:::['9-5-292']
did my little outburst......blunt the hideousness:::['9-5-293']
that is this evening?:::['9-5-294']
look, i know you all have a lot going on......but all i wanted to do was have dinner:::['9-5-295']
with my friends on my birthday.:::['9-5-296']
and you are all so late, and you didn't even have the courtesy to call.:::['9-5-297']
well, it's too late now.:::['9-5-298']
yeah, pheebs, i don't think that's us.:::['9-5-299']
oh, well, this is... this is not over. hello?:::['9-5-300']
what is going on with you two? well, you see, i'm ovulating.:::['9-5-301']
oh, yeah, that's what she says.:::['9-5-302']
but maybe you're not ovulating at all. maybe it's a clever ruse to get me into bed.:::['9-5-303']
yeah, smokey, that's what it was. i just can't get enough.:::['9-5-304']
you're not gonna believe this. she lied. she tricked me into having sex with her.:::['9-5-305']
so? you got to have sex, right?:::['9-5-306']
what's the matter with me? why am i such a girl?:::['9-5-307']
okay. that was mike. oh, phoebe, honey, we are so sorry.:::['9-5-308']
you are totally right. we are here 100 percent......and we love you, and we are ready:::['9-5-309']
to start your birthday celebration.:::['9-5-310']
oh. you guys, that means the world to me.:::['9-5-311']
okay, i'm gonna take off.:::['9-5-312']
oh, i love you guys too, but mike got off work early.:::['9-5-314']
wait. i'm not the... i'm not the kind of girl that just ditches her friends......to be with her boyfriend.:::['9-5-316']
you know what? i am.:::['9-5-317']
bye, guys. judy. bye.:::['9-5-318']
oh, thank god. if phoebe's gone, can we take emma home?:::['9-5-319']
that's a good idea. our babysitter just pounded another chardonnay.:::['9-5-320']
bye, you guys. monica: bye.:::['9-5-321']
see you. well, i guess it's just us.:::['9-5-322']
so i'm probably still ovulating. do you wanna give it another try?:::['9-5-323']
so you've never had sex with a kennedy, have you?:::['9-5-324']
you're gonna go do it? we don't have much time.:::['9-5-325']
once the egg descends into the fallopian tube...:::['9-5-326']
whoa, whoa, get out of here.:::['9-5-327']
i sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.:::['9-5-328']
no, just me. all alone.:::['9-5-329']
dinner for six for one.:::['9-5-330']
well, you boys are about to see something really special.:::['9-5-331']
how was everything, sir? excellent.:::['9-5-332']
the shrew, in particular, was exquisite.:::['9-5-333']
well, i hope you've got some room left.:::['9-5-334']
happy birthday, dear:::['9-5-337']
joey. joey.:::['9-5-338']
joey:::['9-5-339']
this is the best birthday ever.:::['9-5-341']
oh. hey, ross.:::['9-4-0']
i'm so glad someone's here. could you zip me up?:::['9-4-1']
sure. thank you.:::['9-4-2']
can you believe no one between my apartment and here......offered to do that for me?:::['9-4-3']
people.:::['9-4-4']
so why are you so dressed up?:::['9-4-5']
oh, mike's picking me up for a date.:::['9-4-6']
oh, yeah? now, how's that going? is it getting serious?:::['9-4-7']
i don't know. i don't know. i mean, you know, i like him.:::['9-4-8']
but, you know, am i ready to take my grade a loins off the meat market?:::['9-4-9']
i'm not quite sure.:::['9-4-10']
you know, i really admire your whole dating attitude.:::['9-4-11']
it's so healthy. i'm always like, "is this moving too fast?:::['9-4-12']
is this moving too slow? where's this going?":::['9-4-13']
yeah, i know. you are a bit of a drama queen.:::['9-4-14']
you're so much better off, you know? you just go from guy to guy having fun......and not worrying that it:::['9-4-15']
never turns into anything serious.:::['9-4-16']
i wouldn't say "never.":::['9-4-17']
you know, there is that guy.:::['9-4-18']
okay, well, what about?:::['9-4-19']
okay, well, there has gotta be someone.:::['9-4-20']
there isn't! that's what i'm saying. oh, my god, you're right!:::['9-4-21']
i know. and yet, here you are, all ready for the next date.:::['9-4-22']
i can't believe i never realized this before.:::['9-4-23']
i'm in my 30s, and i've never been in a long-term relationship.:::['9-4-24']
oh, my god, what's wrong with me?:::['9-4-25']
um, there's nothing wrong with you.:::['9-4-27']
i mean, you don't strike me as the type of person that wants to get married anyway.:::['9-4-28']
i want to get married!:::['9-4-29']
no, please... please don't cry because of me.:::['9-4-30']
pheebs, i don't know what i'm talking about, okay? i've been divorced three times.:::['9-4-31']
well, at least you've been married.:::['9-4-32']
oh, my god. i want to trade lives with ross?:::['9-4-33']
what's wrong? nothing. i'm excited about our date.:::['9-4-35']
mike, this is ross geller. ross, this is mike...:::['9-4-36']
sorry, i didn't catch that. mike hannigan.:::['9-4-37']
oh, ross geller. hey.:::['9-4-38']
uh, so are you sure you're ready to go? uh-huh.:::['9-4-39']
how do i look?:::['9-4-40']
do you have a compact in your purse? no.:::['9-4-41']
hey, joey. this girl won't turn around.:::['9-4-43']
i can't tell whether she's hot or not. what do you think?:::['9-4-44']
joey, i am not going to objectify women with you.:::['9-4-45']
but if her face is as nice as her ass...:::['9-4-46']
whoo, mama. all right. thanks.:::['9-4-47']
hey, have you talked to chandler? he has to stay in tulsa this weekend.:::['9-4-48']
how come? i don't know. he has to work.:::['9-4-49']
there's some big rush on the...:::['9-4-50']
one of these days, i'm gonna have to start listening... ...when he talks about his job.:::['9-4-52']
hey, why don't you fly out there and surprise him?:::['9-4-53']
maybe i will go.:::['9-4-54']
yeah. we'll have a little second honeymoon at the tulsa ramada.:::['9-4-55']
oh, and you know what you should bring?:::['9-4-56']
your black see-through teddy with the attached garters.:::['9-4-57']
how do you know i have one of those? didn't until just now.:::['9-4-58']
ugh. hot. not hot.:::['9-4-59']
hot!:::['9-4-60']
uh, i said that i think you're hot.:::['9-4-62']
and, uh, now i'm embarrassed. heh.:::['9-4-63']
oh, i thought you said "hi.":::['9-4-64']
that would've been better.:::['9-4-65']
i'll try that. hi, i'm joey.:::['9-4-66']
i'm hayley.:::['9-4-67']
oh. look, i don't normally ask out women that i meet in coffeehouses.:::['9-4-68']
gesundheit.:::['9-4-70']
but... i would love to go out with you.:::['9-4-71']
really? great.:::['9-4-72']
did i...? did i actually ask you?:::['9-4-73']
oh, um, that's just where you were going. i figured i'd help you out.:::['9-4-74']
you don't seem like the kind of guy who does this a lot?:::['9-4-75']
seriously, gunther. you should see someone about that cold.:::['9-4-77']
if it gets much worse, you could die.:::['9-4-78']
so how'd the date go? well, it was awful.:::['9-4-79']
every time i thought about what you said, i started crying.:::['9-4-80']
so he hasn't called? would you call this girl::::['9-4-81']
"thanks for a lovely evening"?:::['9-4-82']
now i feel terrible. this is all my fault.:::['9-4-83']
you should feel terrible about?:::['9-4-84']
this could have been my serious guy.:::['9-4-85']
he was sweet and smart and funny.:::['9-4-86']
do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that?:::['9-4-87']
we are a rare breed.:::['9-4-88']
what a great dinner.:::['9-4-89']
yeah, and hey, thanks again... ...for letting me have that last piece of cake at the restaurant.:::['9-4-90']
ha, ha. you're welcome again. i'm gonna go make some coffee.:::['9-4-91']
can i get you anything? uh, do you have any cake?:::['9-4-92']
joey: so this is going pretty good.:::['9-4-93']
dinner was nice. we've got a lot in common.:::['9-4-94']
ooh, victoria's secret. huh.:::['9-4-95']
we even like the same books.:::['9-4-96']
ooh. there's a scary painting.:::['9-4-97']
i think i've been scared by that painting before.:::['9-4-99']
you know what? this whole place looks familiar.:::['9-4-100']
i have definitely been in this apartment.:::['9-4-101']
i know i've seen this weird plant before.:::['9-4-102']
ow! it did that the last time!:::['9-4-103']
oh, my god. i've gone out with this girl before.:::['9-4-104']
yeah! we had sex on this couch!:::['9-4-105']
and then on that chair, and... no.:::['9-4-106']
no, we didn't do it here......which is weird, because it seems:::['9-4-107']
like a perfectly good place.:::['9-4-108']
ow. that's why.:::['9-4-109']
hey, mike. uh, sorry to just drop by like this. can i come in?:::['9-4-110']
i'm ross. phoebe's friend from the coffeehouse?:::['9-4-113']
right, yeah.:::['9-4-114']
i really, really need to talk to you about something.:::['9-4-115']
okay. unless...:::['9-4-116']
you're not gonna try and get me to join a cult, are you?:::['9-4-117']
no. oh...:::['9-4-118']
no, it's just, you know, you have that look.:::['9-4-119']
damn supercuts.:::['9-4-120']
well, what's up? is phoebe okay? oh, yeah, yeah. no.:::['9-4-121']
oh, phoebe is great. but, um...:::['9-4-122']
i'm an idiot, okay?:::['9-4-123']
look, right before you guys went out, i accidentally got her all upset.:::['9-4-124']
oh. that's why she was weird.:::['9-4-125']
yes, yeah. i said something stupid......about her never having:::['9-4-126']
had a serious relationship.:::['9-4-127']
but you should know, she is so much fun. a wonderful person.:::['9-4-128']
please, don't blow her off. i'm not gonna blow her off.:::['9-4-129']
i actually just got off the phone with her. we're going out tomorrow night.:::['9-4-130']
i mean, i hope that's okay with you, stranger from the coffeehouse.:::['9-4-131']
well, then, i didn't need to bother you.:::['9-4-132']
um, you or the four other mike hannigans i bothered.:::['9-4-133']
hey, wait, wait, wait. is that true what you said?:::['9-4-134']
phoebe's never had a serious relationship?:::['9-4-135']
of course she has.:::['9-4-136']
if she's never had a serious relationship......do you think i'd go:::['9-4-137']
around broadcasting it......like some kind of unstoppable moron?:::['9-4-138']
but you did say it. yes. yes, i did.:::['9-4-139']
and i will also say......what i'm about to say......vis-à-vis......the following.:::['9-4-140']
phoebe has never had a serious relationship......since......her super-serious relationship......with......vikram.:::['9-4-141']
vikram? what? that's a real name.:::['9-4-142']
oklahoma, where the wind comes:::['9-4-143']
sweeping down the plain:::['9-4-144']
stop it.:::['9-4-145', '10-1-153', '5-24-291']
why couldn't they have sent me to texas?:::['9-4-146']
seven o'clock.:::['9-4-147']
maybe i'll hit the gym.:::['9-4-148']
ah, who am i kidding? pay-per-view porn.:::['9-4-149']
do not disturb! do not disturb! surprise!:::['9-4-150']
monica? is everything all right?:::['9-4-151']
yeah, everything's great. i was just, uh......watching some:::['9-4-152']
regular television there.:::['9-4-153']
what a pleasant surprise.:::['9-4-154']
i'm gonna go freshen up, okay? okay, honey.:::['9-4-155']
ooh. that was close.:::['9-4-156']
hello. monica: rach, it's me.:::['9-4-157']
okay, i just got to chandler's room, and i caught him......molesting himself.:::['9-4-158']
ugh. that couldn't have been pretty.:::['9-4-159']
but you know, guys do that.:::['9-4-160']
uh, well, the weird part is......he was getting off:::['9-4-161']
to a shark-attack show.:::['9-4-162']
no! yes! chandler watches shark porn!:::['9-4-163']
while watching sharks? yeah.:::['9-4-164']
are you sure that's what he was doing?:::['9-4-165']
do you know how many times i've seen him jump up like that?:::['9-4-166']
believe me, i know what he was doing.:::['9-4-167']
man. sharks.:::['9-4-168']
i always knew there was something weird about that dude.:::['9-4-169']
you promised to love him no matter what.:::['9-4-170']
"what" means, like, if he gets a disease or kills someone.:::['9-4-171']
not if he gets his jollies to jaws. oh.:::['9-4-172']
you know what, honey? guys are just different.:::['9-4-173']
they like things that we can't understand.:::['9-4-174']
you know, i once dated this guy who wanted to pretend......that he was an archeologist,and that i was this......naughty cavewoman:::['9-4-175']
who he unfroze from a block of ice.:::['9-4-176']
ew, are you talking about my brother?:::['9-4-177']
yeah, i didn't disguise that very well, did i?:::['9-4-178']
listen to this. i went out with this girl last night. halfway through our date i realized......i already slept with her.:::['9-4-180']
you've slept with all the women in new york... ...and now you're going around again?:::['9-4-181']
that's not even the weird part.:::['9-4-182']
i don't think she remembered sleeping with me! but you don't remember sleeping with her.:::['9-4-183']
yeah, but she should remember sleeping with me. i am very memorable!:::['9-4-184']
you guys know. how do we know?:::['9-4-185']
we've never slept with you. and whose fault is that?:::['9-4-186']
what's the big deal? you forgot, she forgot.:::['9-4-187']
maybe you were having an off night. hey!:::['9-4-188']
i never have an off night. okay?:::['9-4-189']
although, sometimes if i'm a little bloated, i don't feel that sexy.:::['9-4-190']
but even then, i'm better than most.:::['9-4-191']
honey, why don't you just let it go and ask her out again?:::['9-4-192']
yeah, you're both so slutty, you don't remember who you slept with.:::['9-4-193']
you're made for each other.:::['9-4-194']
interesting. yeah.:::['9-4-195']
all right, well, i'll go out with her again and i'll try to get past it.:::['9-4-196']
no salt! bloaty!:::['9-4-197']
joey? what?:::['9-4-198']
you don't think sharks are sexy, do you?:::['9-4-199']
wait a minute. wait, what was the little mermaid?:::['9-4-201']
it's open!:::['9-4-202']
hey. hey. mike called! we're going out again!:::['9-4-203']
yay! yay! yay.:::['9-4-204']
quick thing. i went to talk to mike. yeah.:::['9-4-205']
what did you...? what did you do, ross?:::['9-4-207']
oh, boy. you got mad at that part.:::['9-4-208']
i went over there, you know, to tell him how...:::['9-4-209']
how great you are. ahem, but...:::['9-4-210']
well, you know me. blah, blah, blah.:::['9-4-211']
and i ended up telling him, um, that... what?:::['9-4-212']
um, you had a six-year-long relationship......with a guy named vikram.:::['9-4-213']
well, he seemed......to bum hard when i told him you'd:::['9-4-215']
never been in a serious relationship.:::['9-4-216']
if you hadn't just had a baby with my best friend......i swear to lucifer......a rabid dog would be feasting:::['9-4-217']
on your danglers right now.:::['9-4-218']
phoebe, i think you'll feel differently when you know......a little bit about vikram.:::['9-4-219']
okay, he's, um...:::['9-4-220']
he's a kite designer.:::['9-4-221']
and he used to date oprah.:::['9-4-222']
i'm not going along with some lie you made up, ross.:::['9-4-223']
i'm just gonna be honest with him. good.:::['9-4-224']
yeah, just be honest with him.:::['9-4-225']
yeah, i have nothing to be ashamed of. no.:::['9-4-226']
okay, so, all right, i haven't been in a relationship... ...that lasted longer than a month.:::['9-4-227']
okay? i haven't had a real boyfriend.:::['9-4-228']
you know, if he can't handle it, then he can leave. which he will.:::['9-4-229']
and, you know, that's okay. so i'll just be alone forever.:::['9-4-230']
you know, all right. it'll be fine. it'll be fine.:::['9-4-231']
i'll go on walking tours with widows and lesbians.:::['9-4-232']
i'll get it. phoebe: okay.:::['9-4-233']
i'm trying to remember the last time i opened a door and you weren't there.:::['9-4-234']
phoebe, are you okay?:::['9-4-235']
uh-huh. yeah. there's just, um...:::['9-4-236']
vikram just called.:::['9-4-238']
so it was really a shock after 25 years of marriage......my parents getting divorced.:::['9-4-239']
i took it the hardest......because i was the youngest.:::['9-4-240']
mm-hm. sure. yeah.:::['9-4-241']
how can you not remember me?:::['9-4-242']
how could you not remember that we slept together?:::['9-4-244']
what? when? i don't know.:::['9-4-245']
i really, really think i would remember sleeping with you.:::['9-4-246']
come on, come on. search your brain, all right? it was......a certain amount of time ago.:::['9-4-247']
okay, i was here. you were here.:::['9-4-248']
we had sex here, here, here...:::['9-4-249']
not there.:::['9-4-250']
anything? no, it's not ringing any bells.:::['9-4-251']
my god, woman.:::['9-4-252']
how many people have you been with not to remember this?:::['9-4-253']
hey, hayley. we really gotta fix that doorknob.:::['9-4-254']
i slept with you!:::['9-4-257']
and you obviously remember me. hey, i still got it!:::['9-4-258']
so we're good.:::['9-4-259']
and i said, "okay, vikram......you can't just call:::['9-4-261']
every time you get lonely. yeah. you know?:::['9-4-262']
you gave up that right when you slept with rachel.":::['9-4-263']
rachel? i thought she just had a baby with ross.:::['9-4-264']
you know, but emma's birth certificate might say "geller"......but her eyes say "mukherjee.":::['9-4-267']
that is so wrong. and on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?:::['9-4-268']
i know. but he calls, and my heart goes to him.:::['9-4-269']
you know, that bastard is one smooth-talking freelance kite designer.:::['9-4-270']
i think there's somebody better out there for you.:::['9-4-271']
i mean, you know, i'm... i'm not saying me, but...:::['9-4-272']
maybe me.:::['9-4-273']
and you don't have to worry about glue-sniffing with me.:::['9-4-275']
although, i do smell the occasional magic marker.:::['9-4-276']
yeah. uh, anyway, i just...:::['9-4-277']
i think i can make you happy.:::['9-4-278']
okay, i can't do this. what's wrong?:::['9-4-279']
well, there is no vikram. ross made him up.:::['9-4-280']
because i...:::['9-4-281']
i really never have been in a long-term relationship.:::['9-4-282']
i've never lived with a guy. i've never even celebrated an anniversary.:::['9-4-283']
you know, if that's too weird for you......and you want to leave,i totally understand.:::['9-4-285']
in fact, i'll close my eyes to make it less awkward.:::['9-4-286']
you kissed me.:::['9-4-287']
so you don't think i'm a total freak? no.:::['9-4-289']
look, can i?:::['9-4-291']
can i think you're a little weird and also cool......for telling me the truth:::['9-4-292']
and also want to kiss you?:::['9-4-293']
can i think it's cool that you kissed me......and also want to kiss you again?:::['9-4-295']
and, um, be a little concerned about the magic markers?:::['9-4-296']
definitely.:::['9-4-297']
this is vikram.:::['9-4-298']
hi, honey, i'm home.:::['9-4-299']
how was your flight? oh, it was great.:::['9-4-301']
why don't you sit down.:::['9-4-302']
get yourself comfortable.:::['9-4-303']
because i have a little......surprise for you.:::['9-4-304']
well, well, well. it must be 5 in tulsa......because it's sex o'clock in n.y. c!:::['9-4-305']
okay. this is how much i love you.:::['9-4-306']
the great white...:::['9-4-307']
honey?:::['9-4-308', '2-15-326']
why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around?:::['9-4-309']
oh, is this...? is this not the good part?:::['9-4-310']
do you want me to fast-forward to something toothier?:::['9-4-311']
no, i'm just not sure that you got the right movie, that's all.:::['9-4-312']
oh. this is the only one they had at our video store.:::['9-4-313']
though they did have something called crocodile killers.:::['9-4-314']
or does it always have to be sharks?:::['9-4-315']
does what always have to be sharks?:::['9-4-316']
honey, look, we can do something else.:::['9-4-317']
do you want me to get into the tub and thrash?:::['9-4-318']
what's going on? sweetie, it's okay. it's okay.:::['9-4-319']
let me be a part of this. let me be a part of this!:::['9-4-321']
i saw what you were doing in tulsa.:::['9-4-322']
angry sharks turn you on!:::['9-4-323']
no, they don't.:::['9-4-324']
then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat?:::['9-4-325']
oh, my god. when you came in, i switched the channel.:::['9-4-326']
i was just watching regular porn.:::['9-4-327']
yes. just some good, old-fashioned, american, girl-on-girl action.:::['9-4-329']
can i tell you how happy that makes me? oh.:::['9-4-330']
you are an amazing wife.:::['9-4-331']
really, you are amazing. you were actually gonna do this for me?:::['9-4-332']
i mean, where do you find the strength and the understanding for that?:::['9-4-333']
i'm very, very drunk right now.:::['9-4-334']
see, ordinarily, i would talk to her, but my confidence is shaken.:::['9-4-335']
did i sleep with her? did i not sleep with her?:::['9-4-336']
you know, maybe this is a wake-up call. you know, about your whole dating attitude.:::['9-4-337']
you're in your 30s and you have never been in a long-term relationship.:::['9-4-338']
here you go from woman to woman......meaningless experience:::['9-4-339']
to meaningless experience.:::['9-4-340']
never even worrying that it doesn't turn into something more serious.:::['9-4-341']
you're right. i love my life!:::['9-4-342']
i actually did sleep with her. heh.:::['9-4-343']
this kitty is mittens. this one is fitzhugh.:::['9-9-0']
and this little guy in the cat condo is jinkies.:::['9-9-1']
yeah. that's a lot of cats, jo lynn.:::['9-9-2']
single, are you?:::['9-9-3']
hey. you're answering your own phone? where's your crazy assistant?:::['9-9-5']
what's up, joe?:::['9-9-6', '5-16-221']
okay, what have we always wanted to do together?:::['9-9-7']
braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?:::['9-9-8']
no. no. no. when you get home tomorrow night......you and i are gonna be:::['9-9-9']
at the wizards-knicks game, courtside.:::['9-9-10']
courtside? oh, my god. yeah.:::['9-9-11']
maybe michael jordan will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.:::['9-9-12']
that is so cool. i'll let monica know.:::['9-9-13']
hello? joey just called.:::['9-9-14']
he's got courtside knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.:::['9-9-15']
really? but tomorrow night's the only night i get off from the restaurant.:::['9-9-16']
if you go, we won't have a night together for another week.:::['9-9-17']
but honey, it's courtside. the cheerleaders are gonna be right in f...:::['9-9-18']
that's not the way to convince you.:::['9-9-19']
chandler, i don't wanna be one of those wives that says::::['9-9-20']
"you can't go to the game. you have to spend time with me.":::['9-9-21']
so if you could just realize it on your own...:::['9-9-22']
i know. you're right. i wanna see you too.:::['9-9-23']
i just gotta figure out a way to tell joey. he's really looking forward to this.:::['9-9-24']
tell him you haven't seen your wife in a long time.:::['9-9-25']
tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult.:::['9-9-26']
tell him that what little time we have together is precious.:::['9-9-27']
eh, yeah, i'll think of something.:::['9-9-28']
wow. heh. wow, you look, uh...:::['9-9-29']
i mean, it's just, uh... that dress, uh...:::['9-9-30']
well, i hope the ends of these sentences are good.:::['9-9-31']
heh. oh, they're good. it's just been a while since i've seen you like this.:::['9-9-32']
you clean up good.:::['9-9-33']
oh, really? well, thank you.:::['9-9-34']
okay, stop. stop looking at me like that.:::['9-9-35']
last time that happened, that happened. oh, right, right.:::['9-9-36']
so are you excited about your first night away from emma?:::['9-9-37']
yeah, yeah. phoebe and i are gonna have so much fun.:::['9-9-38']
and thank you for watching the baby. oh, it's fine.:::['9-9-39']
actually, i invited mike over.:::['9-9-40']
phoebe's mike? yeah.:::['9-9-41']
i didn't know you guys hung out. we don't......but i thought it'd be nice:::['9-9-42']
to get to know him.:::['9-9-43']
maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.:::['9-9-44']
oh, that's so cute. ross and mike's first date.:::['9-9-45']
is that gonna be awkward? what are you guys gonna talk about?:::['9-9-46']
i don't know. but you know, we have a lot in common, you know?:::['9-9-47']
um, he plays piano. i played keyboards in college.:::['9-9-48']
uh, he's been divorced. i have some experience in that area.:::['9-9-49']
rachel: yeah? hi.:::['9-9-50']
ooh. girls' night out indeed.:::['9-9-52']
okay, so i think emma is probably down for the night......but if you need anything...:::['9-9-53']
rach, we'll be fine.:::['9-9-54']
you go have fun. okay, you too.:::['9-9-55']
thanks. and i hope you score.:::['9-9-56']
okay. bye. bye.:::['9-9-57']
so, welcome.:::['9-9-58']
i got beer. i got bottled breast milk.:::['9-9-59']
eh, why don't we start with the beer? okay.:::['9-9-60']
so, um, ahem, phoebe tells me you, uh, play piano.:::['9-9-61']
you know, i used to, uh, play keyboards in college.:::['9-9-63']
oh. do you have one here?:::['9-9-64']
mike: ah.:::['9-9-67']
um, uh, you know, i'm divorced.:::['9-9-68']
uh, phoebe... phoebe says you're... you've been divorced?:::['9-9-69']
yeah, yeah.:::['9-9-70', '4-24-187']
yeah, i'm sorry. i don't really like to talk about it.:::['9-9-71']
that's okay. we'll talk about something else.:::['9-9-72']
so you're a paleontologist, right? yeah.:::['9-9-73']
my cousin's a paleontologist. ah.:::['9-9-74']
well, he and i would probably have a lot to talk about.:::['9-9-75']
monica: hi. hey.:::['9-9-76']
welcome home. oh, well, look at you.:::['9-9-77']
yeah. what do you think?:::['9-9-78']
well, it looks great. it's just...:::['9-9-79']
well, i'm wearing the same thing underneath, so...:::['9-9-80']
you see what i mean? heh.:::['9-9-81']
joey: hey. how come your door's locked?:::['9-9-82']
just a second. no, no, no.:::['9-9-83']
joey can't know that i'm here. why not?:::['9-9-84']
i didn't know how to tell him i couldn't go to the game......so i told him i had to stay in tulsa.:::['9-9-85']
so you lied to him?:::['9-9-86']
it's always better to lie than to have the complicated discussion.:::['9-9-87']
except with you.:::['9-9-88']
joey: hey, open the door. what's going on?:::['9-9-89']
what are you...? monica: hi.:::['9-9-90']
why are you dressed like that?:::['9-9-91']
because, um, well, chandler's gonna be home in a couple of days......so i thought i would just, um, you know,practice the art of seduction.:::['9-9-92']
i thought i heard a man's voice before.:::['9-9-93']
no, i was just doing chandler's side of the conversation.:::['9-9-94']
you know, like, "hi, how do i look?":::['9-9-95']
could i be any more turned on?":::['9-9-96']
you know.:::['9-9-97', '2-12-170', '4-17-163', '3-15-41']
okay. wait a minute.:::['9-9-98', '9-11-251']
why are there two glasses of wine out?:::['9-9-99']
because one of them is for you.:::['9-9-100']
cheers. okay, bye-bye.:::['9-9-101']
you know, it's funny. i've been, uh, practicing the art of seduction myself.:::['9-9-102']
you might wanna keep practicing. yeah.:::['9-9-103']
it's joey. what?:::['9-9-104']
hey, joe. dude, come home.:::['9-9-105']
what? why? come home.:::['9-9-106']
look, i can't. what's going on?:::['9-9-107']
i don't know how to tell you this, but, uh, i think monica's cheating on you.:::['9-9-108']
i told you you shouldn't have married someone so much hotter than you.:::['9-9-109']
all right, if you can't deal with this, then i'm gonna.:::['9-9-110']
no. i just heard him.:::['9-9-111']
can you hear him now?:::['9-9-112']
no. all right, i'm going in.:::['9-9-113']
no, wait. i heard him again.:::['9-9-114']
all right, look, just stay there. i'm coming home.:::['9-9-115']
okay, i'll see you when you get here.:::['9-9-116']
i'm gonna wait out in the hall in case the dude comes out.:::['9-9-117']
is that really necessary? absolutely. you'd do it for me.:::['9-9-118']
not that you ever have to, because i know how to keep my women satisfied.:::['9-9-119']
shouldn't the pizza be here by now?:::['9-9-120']
i mean, they said 30 minutes or less. well, how long has it been?:::['9-9-121']
eleven minutes.:::['9-9-122']
and now 12.:::['9-9-123']
so you like the beer? i do. i do.:::['9-9-124']
although, it's actually a lager. huh.:::['9-9-125']
what's the difference between beer and lager?:::['9-9-126']
we could look it up.:::['9-9-128']
things are about to get wild.:::['9-9-129']
oh, god, remember the girls' nights we used to have......sitting around talking:::['9-9-130']
about you and ross?:::['9-9-131']
oh, god. it seems like forever ago.:::['9-9-132']
ah. so, what's going on with you and ross?:::['9-9-134']
well, um, i don't know. i mean, for a long time, nothing.:::['9-9-135']
but, you know, actually, right before you picked me up......ross and i had a, uh, little thing.:::['9-9-136']
oh, my god. i love things. what happened?:::['9-9-137']
well, um, first he told me he liked how i looked.:::['9-9-138']
uh-huh. and, uh, then we had a little, um......eye contact.:::['9-9-139']
eye contact? mm-hm.:::['9-9-140']
i hope you were using protection.:::['9-9-141']
excuse me, um, these are from the two gentlemen at the end of the bar.:::['9-9-142']
should we send them something back? ooh, let's send them mashed potatoes.:::['9-9-143']
no, wait. don't do that.:::['9-9-144']
that's gonna make them think they can come over.:::['9-9-145']
so, what if they do?:::['9-9-146']
we're not here to meet guys. you have a boyfriend. i have a baby and a ross.:::['9-9-147']
yeah, but nothing has to happen. we're just having fun.:::['9-9-148']
you know, not everything has to go as far as eye contact.:::['9-9-149']
chandler, you have to tell joey that you're not in tulsa.:::['9-9-150']
don't you think it's better for him to think you're cheating on me......than for him to think:::['9-9-151']
i'm cheating on him?:::['9-9-152']
i heard it.:::['9-9-153', '9-9-162']
i don't want him to think that i'm having an affair.:::['9-9-154']
all right, i've got a plan. i'll go down the fire escape...:::['9-9-155']
because all good plans start with, "i'll go down the fire escape.":::['9-9-156']
hear me out, woman.:::['9-9-157']
i'll go down the fire escape, then i'll wait.:::['9-9-158']
then when i come up the stairs it'll be like i just got back.:::['9-9-159']
then joey and i will come in and see that there's no guy in here.:::['9-9-160']
aren't you afraid that joey's gonna figure all this out?:::['9-9-161']
i'm just gonna wait. the scary pigeon's back?:::['9-9-163']
it's huge.:::['9-9-164']
oh, my god. i can't believe you live in that building. my grandmother lives in that building.:::['9-9-165']
ida green? no sense of personal space......kind of smells like chicken,looks like a potato.:::['9-9-166']
"spuds" is your grandmother? that's my bubby.:::['9-9-167']
so we're on our way to a couple of parties.:::['9-9-168']
um, maybe we can get your numbers and call if we find something fun?:::['9-9-169']
yeah. i'm sorry, we weren't really looking for anything to happen......with you guys. i have a boyfriend.:::['9-9-170']
all right. it's no big deal.:::['9-9-171']
so she has a boyfriend. what is your situation?:::['9-9-172']
oh, well, it's complicated. i don't actually have a boyfriend, but, uh...:::['9-9-173']
then can i have your number?:::['9-9-174']
i'm sorry, no.:::['9-9-175']
oh, my god, you're giving your real number.:::['9-9-178']
okay, thanks. i'll give you a call later tonight.:::['9-9-179']
great. bye.:::['9-9-180']
wow. so that's great.:::['9-9-182']
you, bill, ross and emma are gonna be so happy together.:::['9-9-183']
i don't know. he was cute and he liked me. it was an impulse.:::['9-9-185']
but what about ross? what about your moment?:::['9-9-186']
don't you wanna talk to ross about it? no.:::['9-9-187']
no, because i know exactly how the conversation's gonna go.:::['9-9-188']
"hey, ross, you know, i think we had a moment before.":::['9-9-189']
"yeah. ahem. me too.":::['9-9-190']
i really want to do anything about it.":::['9-9-191']
"yeah. ahem. me neither.":::['9-9-192']
"should we just live together......and not tell each other:::['9-9-193']
how we're feeling?":::['9-9-194']
"yeah, that works for me.":::['9-9-195']
yeah, i see what you mean.:::['9-9-196']
by the way, nice ross imitation. but your rachel wasn't whiny enough.:::['9-9-197']
what? hey. better.:::['9-9-198']
the point is maybe i should just stop waiting around for moments with ross.:::['9-9-199']
you know? i should just move on with my life.:::['9-9-200']
so really, you're moving on from ross?:::['9-9-201']
i don't know. do i have to decide right now?:::['9-9-202']
you kind of just did. that guy is gonna call you tonight.:::['9-9-203']
ross is gonna pick up the phone, and that's a pretty clear message.:::['9-9-204']
oh, my god, ross.:::['9-9-205', '7-9-76']
ross is gonna pick up the phone.:::['9-9-206']
oh, i have to get my number back. oh, my god, he's gone.:::['9-9-207']
my number back. oh, my god. he's gone.":::['9-9-208']
dead on.:::['9-9-209']
you know, i'm gonna take off. so soon?:::['9-9-210']
well, thanks, uh... thanks for the beer.:::['9-9-212']
you mean lager? ah, yeah. good times.:::['9-9-213']
hello? hey, mike, it's me.:::['9-9-214']
listen, is, um... is ross near you?:::['9-9-215']
uh, no, i just left.:::['9-9-216']
well, you have to go back in.:::['9-9-217']
what? go back? to the land where time stands still?:::['9-9-218']
i'm so sorry, honey, but...:::['9-9-219']
okay, rachel gave this guy her number......and, um, she doesn't want ross:::['9-9-220']
to answer the phone.:::['9-9-221']
so you have to intercept all his calls.:::['9-9-222']
he says he can't do that. oh, give me the phone.:::['9-9-224']
hi, mike. hi, listen, i know that this is a lot to ask, but you know what?:::['9-9-225']
if you do this, phoebe will do anything you want.:::['9-9-226']
seriously, i'm talking dirty stuff. all right. thank you. hello?:::['9-9-227']
hi, i'm sorry about her. but actually, she wasn't wrong about the dirty stuff.:::['9-9-228']
all right, i'll do it.:::['9-9-229', '7-5-132', '4-5-28']
but really, how much dirtier can it get?:::['9-9-230']
oh, mike.:::['9-9-231']
hey, buddy.:::['9-9-233', '5-7-235']
uh, hi.:::['9-9-234']
um, can i come back in? why?:::['9-9-235']
well, i was just thinking about how much more we have to talk about.:::['9-9-236']
but you left.:::['9-9-237']
wow, that didn't take long.:::['9-9-238']
i thought you said tulsa was like a three-hour flight?:::['9-9-239']
well, you're forgetting about the time difference.:::['9-9-240']
joey: yeah.:::['9-9-241', '10-17-541']
chandler, you're home.:::['9-9-242']
that's right. your husband's home. so now the sex can stop.:::['9-9-243']
joey said you're in here with another man.:::['9-9-245']
there's no man in here. how dare you accuse me of that.:::['9-9-246']
then maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh?:::['9-9-248']
what's he doing?:::['9-9-249']
i arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.:::['9-9-250']
bedroom's clear. although you might need some new pillows.:::['9-9-251']
all right, well, i'll check the guest room.:::['9-9-252']
why do i smell men's cologne?:::['9-9-253']
i think that's you.:::['9-9-254']
oh, yeah. i rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.:::['9-9-255']
there's nobody here, joe.:::['9-9-256']
i guess not.:::['9-9-257']
i can't believe you thought i was cheating. you owe me an apology.:::['9-9-258']
you're right, monica. i'm so sorry. it's an honest mistake.:::['9-9-259']
it could happen to anybody. all right, see you.:::['9-9-260']
joey: wait a minute, wait a minute.:::['9-9-261']
if you just got back from tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?:::['9-9-262']
i climbed down the fire escape, and you can't put that in the closet?:::['9-9-263']
so with the exception of the fermentation process......beer and ale:::['9-9-264']
are basically the same thing.:::['9-9-265']
fascinating, isn't it?:::['9-9-266']
maybe you should look up "fascinating.":::['9-9-267']
hello? ross' place. mike speaking.:::['9-9-269']
it's for you.:::['9-9-270']
i don't understand what just happened here.:::['9-9-271']
i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend the night with monica......and i didn't know...:::['9-9-274']
i didn't think you'd understand.:::['9-9-275']
you think i'm too dumb to understand a husband needs to be with his wife? huh?:::['9-9-276']
you think i'm, like, duh.:::['9-9-277']
joey? yeah.:::['9-9-278']
i don't know what to say. we shouldn't have lied to you.:::['9-9-279']
yeah, i feel so bad. is there anything i can do to make it up to you?:::['9-9-280']
yeah, you could go to the game with me. even though you said you couldn't.:::['9-9-281']
but then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.:::['9-9-282']
i'm sorry, that's the one thing i can't do. i promised i'd be with monica.:::['9-9-283']
you can go. what?:::['9-9-285']
you should go to the game. it's okay. i want you to.:::['9-9-286']
really? you gonna be okay? yeah, i'll be fine.:::['9-9-287']
you know, maybe i'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.:::['9-9-288']
you're gonna put sweats on and clean. it's gonna be so hot.:::['9-9-289']
here's your ticket.:::['9-9-292']
thanks. hey, listen......i'm never gonna lie to you again, okay?:::['9-9-293']
and i want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.:::['9-9-294']
thanks, man.:::['9-9-295', '10-10-232', '5-24-50', '4-12-219', '4-6-148']
where you going? game's tomorrow night, joe.:::['9-9-296']
mike: oh, god. so glad you're back.:::['9-9-298']
so, what did you guys do?:::['9-9-299']
oh, you know, we just drank some beer.:::['9-9-300']
mike played with the boundaries of normal social conduct.:::['9-9-301']
it's true, i did.:::['9-9-302']
well, goodbye. okay.:::['9-9-303']
bye. that was fun, pheebs. i know. it was fun.:::['9-9-304']
see you, guys.:::['9-9-305']
rachel, lock the door. lock the door, seriously.:::['9-9-306']
oh, shoot, i forgot to pay phoebe for the drinks.:::['9-9-307']
wait, wait. wait, sorry. did he call? did that guy call?:::['9-9-308']
no, just his mom.:::['9-9-309']
oh. around 8:30?:::['9-9-310']
yeah. then again at 9:00?:::['9-9-311']
uh, no, she's not here right now. can i take a message?:::['9-9-314']
bill from the bar?:::['9-9-315']
okay, bill from the bar, i'll make sure she gets your number.:::['9-9-316']
so, uh... so how was it?:::['9-9-318']
did you guys...? you guys have a good time?:::['9-9-319']
we had so much fun. it felt so good to be out.:::['9-9-320']
uh, rach?:::['9-9-321']
hey, you guys. phoebe: hey.:::['9-9-324']
mike: hey.:::['9-9-325']
i'll be right back. i gotta go to the bathroom.:::['9-9-326']
stout. that's a kind of beer.:::['9-9-327']
hey, hon? would you help me get the plates down?:::['9-8-0']
hey, here's an idea. why don't we use our wedding china today?:::['9-8-1']
no, i think we should save our china for something really special.:::['9-8-2']
like if the queen of england comes over.:::['9-8-3']
honey, she keeps canceling on us. take the hint.:::['9-8-4']
what if something breaks? they're expensive.:::['9-8-5']
what is the point of having them if we never use them?:::['9-8-6']
okay. but if something breaks and then the queen comes over...:::['9-8-7']
i will explain it to her. like i'd let you talk to the queen.:::['9-8-8']
the parade is really good this year.:::['9-8-9']
man, those horses can crap.:::['9-8-10']
announcer: next up is a marching band from muskogee, oklahoma.:::['9-8-11']
muskogee? that's like four hours from tulsa!:::['9-8-12']
here's the float with the stars of the popular daytime soap......days of our lives.:::['9-8-13']
aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days ofour lives?:::['9-8-15']
i forgot! i'm supposed to be there!:::['9-8-16']
i can't believe i forgot! i usually write stuff like this down on my arm!:::['9-8-17']
stupid long sleeves!:::['9-8-18']
what are you gonna do? i'll come up with a good reason......why i wasn't there.:::['9-8-19']
the producers are gonna be mad. they sat us down and said::::['9-8-20']
"everyone has to be there, 6 a.m. sharp. that means you, tribbiani.":::['9-8-21']
like i was some kind of idiot.:::['9-8-22']
well, you proved them wrong. yeah.:::['9-8-23']
oh, emma.:::['9-8-24']
this is your first thanksgiving.:::['9-8-25']
what are you thankful for?:::['9-8-26']
mommy's boobies?:::['9-8-27']
a lot of people are thankful for those.:::['9-8-28']
woman: hello? rachel?:::['9-8-29']
woman: it's your favorite sister.:::['9-8-31']
jill? amy: amy!:::['9-8-32']
hide my rings.:::['9-8-33']
amy! happy thanksgiving.:::['9-8-34']
do you have a hair straightener?:::['9-8-35']
um... hi.:::['9-8-36']
hair straightener.:::['9-8-38']
i haven't seen you in, like, a year. i know. i know. i've just been crazed.:::['9-8-39']
well, me too. i had a baby.:::['9-8-40']
i decorated dad's office.:::['9-8-41']
yeah? well, unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.:::['9-8-42']
about that hair straightener, honey, i really need one.:::['9-8-43']
i'm gonna have dinner at my boyfriend's house.:::['9-8-44']
oh, my god. uh-huh.:::['9-8-45']
is this emmett?:::['9-8-46']
it's emma.:::['9-8-47']
amy: it's a girl?:::['9-8-48']
hey, amy. rachel: amy, you remember ross?:::['9-8-49']
but you are much cuter than that geeky guy she used to date.:::['9-8-51']
that was me.:::['9-8-52', '9-8-180', '3-11-169', '3-5-207']
no, he was this creepy guy from high school who had this huge crush on her......since, like, the ninth grade.:::['9-8-53']
still me.:::['9-8-54']
no, i'm not talking about you.:::['9-8-55']
it was your fat friend's brother with that bad afro.:::['9-8-56']
okay, amy, i'm gonna save you some time, okay? all me!:::['9-8-57']
careful. careful.:::['9-8-58']
careful!:::['9-8-59']
i'll tell you what. for the rest of our lives......i'll be careful until told otherwise.:::['9-8-60']
this isn't the china we picked out. monica: i know.:::['9-8-61']
after you left the store, i chose different ones.:::['9-8-62']
why? your taste is a little feminine for me.:::['9-8-63']
suddenly flowers are feminine?:::['9-8-64']
hey, everybody! happy thanksgiving!:::['9-8-65']
happy thanksgiving. pheebs! what's going on, joe?:::['9-8-66']
listen, i need a good lie.:::['9-8-67']
how about the whole "man walking on the moon" thing, you know?:::['9-8-69']
you can see the strings, people!:::['9-8-70']
no, no, no. i need a good lie to explain why i wasn't at a work thing today.:::['9-8-71']
honey, you stink at lying. i do not.:::['9-8-72']
really? let me ask you something. yesterday at the coffeehouse......i went to the bathroom. when i came:::['9-8-73']
back, my muffin was gone. who took it?:::['9-8-74']
somebody opened the door to the coffeehouse......and a raccoon ran in and went:::['9-8-75']
straight for your muffin. i said::::['9-8-76']
"hey, don't eat that! that's phoebe's!" and he said...:::['9-8-77']
he said, "joey, you stink at lying." what am i gonna do?:::['9-8-78']
don't worry. we'll come up with a lie. i'll help you.:::['9-8-79']
great. that'd be great. thank you. sure. what was the work thing?:::['9-8-80']
"pick up grandma at the airport." oh, man!:::['9-8-82']
she's precious.:::['9-8-83']
do you ever worry that she's gonna get your real nose?:::['9-8-84']
amy...:::['9-8-85']
yes, i do. i really do.:::['9-8-86']
yeah, hang on, one sec. can i take this upstairs?:::['9-8-88']
sure. we don't live there, but...:::['9-8-89']
seriously? it's just these rooms?:::['9-8-90']
i thought you were a doctor. yeah. no, ross has a ph.d.:::['9-8-91']
ew!:::['9-8-92', '5-10-188', '3-1-61']
god, she is unbelievable.:::['9-8-93']
i know. i mean, a ph.d. is just as good as an md.:::['9-8-94']
sure, ross, yeah!:::['9-8-95']
if i have a heart attack at a restaurant, i want you there with your fossil brush.:::['9-8-96']
stupid thanksgiving. rachel: what?:::['9-8-97']
what? what happened? my boyfriend canceled on me.:::['9-8-98']
i mean, i finally find a real relationship.:::['9-8-99']
someone that i can spend this day with, and then his wife comes back into town!:::['9-8-100']
i swear, it's almost not even worth dating married guys.:::['9-8-101']
don't say that.:::['9-8-102']
god, i was so looking forward to this.:::['9-8-103']
it was gonna be such a beautiful thanksgiving.:::['9-8-104']
we were gonna have sushi.:::['9-8-105']
amy, don't cry.:::['9-8-106']
ross, can i talk to you in private? sure, you wanna go upstairs, or?:::['9-8-107']
look, i was thinking, if it's okay with monica......i would like to invite amy:::['9-8-108']
to thanksgiving.:::['9-8-109']
i think that's a great idea. it'll be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis.:::['9-8-110']
look, i know she's a little tough to take.:::['9-8-111']
but she has nowhere else to go, and she's my sister. she's emma's aunt.:::['9-8-112']
and i would like them to bond. i don't want them bonding too much.:::['9-8-113']
i don't want her telling emma she needs a nose job.:::['9-8-114']
ross, she may need one. we're just gonna have to make our peace with that!:::['9-8-115']
hi! phoebe: hey.:::['9-8-116']
hey, you guys. this is my sister amy.:::['9-8-117']
this is chandler, joey, phoebe, and you know mon.:::['9-8-118']
monica: hi. oh, my god.:::['9-8-119']
you're on days of our lives!:::['9-8-120']
wow! they must put a lot of makeup on you.:::['9-8-122']
happy thanksgiving.:::['9-8-123']
monica: hey. ross: hi.:::['9-8-124']
so welcome. is this the first time you're seeing emma?:::['9-8-125']
yeah, i think so. it's nice to meet you, emma.:::['9-8-126']
phoebe. that's a funny noise.:::['9-8-127']
pheebs? i still need some help here. right. okay.:::['9-8-128']
so it's not just the lie you tell, but it's the way you tell it. for example......if you look at the ground when:::['9-8-129']
you talk, people know you're lying.:::['9-8-130']
i don't know why this is so hard for me. lying is basically just acting......and i am a terrific actor.:::['9-8-131']
you are a terrific actor.:::['9-8-132']
hey. where's the baby? we just put her down for a nap.:::['9-8-133']
listen, i was just thinking. you know what would be incredible?:::['9-8-134']
if you guys died!:::['9-8-135']
thank you, amy.:::['9-8-136']
no, no, then i would get the baby.:::['9-8-137']
it would be just like a movie. at first i wouldn't know what to do with her.:::['9-8-138']
and then i would rise to the occasion. then i'd get a makeover and get married.:::['9-8-139']
that's a great movie!:::['9-8-140']
yeah. listen, not that you guys could stop me or anything......because, you know, you'd be dead.:::['9-8-141']
but i was thinking about changing her name.:::['9-8-142']
i'm just not really a big fan of emily.:::['9-8-143']
emma? ross wants you.:::['9-8-145']
why does she keep making that noise?:::['9-8-147']
honey, i don't know how to tell you this......but if something were to happen:::['9-8-148']
to ross or myself......you wouldn't get the baby.:::['9-8-149']
well, who would?:::['9-8-150']
well, we haven't officially asked them yet......but we would want:::['9-8-151']
monica and chandler.:::['9-8-152']
i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma.:::['9-8-153']
oh, my god, i'm so moved.:::['9-8-154']
i don't believe this. hold on a second. you guys die......and i don't get your baby?:::['9-8-155']
amy, see, we're a lot closer to monica and chandler.:::['9-8-156']
we see them every day. and truthfully, you don't seem connected to the baby.:::['9-8-157']
connected? to what? she's a lump.:::['9-8-158']
you know, guys, i've gotta say this means so much to me.:::['9-8-159']
i mean, that you would trust me with your child.:::['9-8-160']
i mean, we all know that monica and i have been......trying to have a baby of our own.:::['9-8-161']
you know, i've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but...:::['9-8-162']
that you two...:::['9-8-163']
that you two... this guy?:::['9-8-164']
okay, it's time for dinner.:::['9-8-166']
everyone, we're using our fancy china......and it's very expensive,so please be careful.:::['9-8-167']
whoa. whoa. whoa...:::['9-8-168']
okay, just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.:::['9-8-169']
how come my plate's less fancy than everyone else's?:::['9-8-171']
do you not trust me with a fancy plate?:::['9-8-172']
no, honey. that's a special plate.:::['9-8-173']
see, it's a game. whoever gets that plate wins.:::['9-8-174']
i can't believe i won!:::['9-8-175']
you know, this is such a slap in the face. i mean, i'm your sister......and you would give your baby:::['9-8-176']
to these strangers over me.:::['9-8-177']
monica is ross' sister.:::['9-8-178']
no, ross' sister was really fat.:::['9-8-179']
no, she was this dorky girl in school who followed rachel around like a puppy...:::['9-8-181']
amy, you've got to stop doing that!:::['9-8-182']
okay, listen, i know you're having a bit of a family crisis......but you don't have to take it out:::['9-8-183']
on the plates.:::['9-8-184']
i mean, in fact, i think that everyone......should cut their food like this::::['9-8-185']
now, see? this way, you protect the plates......and let's face it, you have fun.:::['9-8-186']
okay, how about this? if you guys die......and the crazy plate lady dies......then do i get the baby?:::['9-8-187']
no, if crazy plate lady...:::['9-8-188']
if monica dies, then i would get emma. right?:::['9-8-189']
well, actually... actually what?:::['9-8-190']
it's just... it's just that in that case......then emma would go:::['9-8-191']
to my parents.:::['9-8-192']
what? hurts, doesn't it?:::['9-8-193']
who has to die for me to get her?:::['9-8-194']
so if monica's not around, i'm not good enough to raise emma?:::['9-8-195']
no, that is not what we're saying.:::['9-8-196']
yeah, he's lying. he looked down.:::['9-8-197']
well, what's wrong with me? am i incompetent?:::['9-8-198']
because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!:::['9-8-199']
you're taking this the wrong way. we think you'll be a wonderful parent.:::['9-8-200']
it's just... you're more the, you know, fun parent.:::['9-8-201']
yeah, and we wanna make sure emma also has someone like monica......who's more of a disciplinarian.:::['9-8-202']
someone who can be firm and strict.:::['9-8-203']
that's not how you see me, is it?:::['9-8-204']
no, you're all about the fun.:::['9-8-205']
i may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think i'm not capable?:::['9-8-206']
no. you both are equally capable.:::['9-8-207']
it's just you're strongest when you're together.:::['9-8-208']
okay. so if we both had emma, and i died......she'd have to give her up.:::['9-8-209']
sure. monica would have to give her up.:::['9-8-210']
i lie better than that, right?:::['9-8-211']
let me just get this straight. so my two friends die, i get emma.:::['9-8-212']
then my wife dies. then emma, the one tiny ray of hope left in my life......gets taken away from me?:::['9-8-213']
there's your movie.:::['9-8-214']
hey, there you are.:::['9-8-215', '5-3-110']
you disappeared after dinner. did somebody miss me?:::['9-8-216']
was there a child to raise poorly?:::['9-8-217']
ross and rachel don't know what they're saying.:::['9-8-218']
it's not like they're so responsible.:::['9-8-219']
emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five-year-old condom.:::['9-8-220']
no, but they're right. i'm not a strong father figure, and i never will be.:::['9-8-221']
no, you learn these things. you grow into it.:::['9-8-222']
yeah, but it's not who i am.:::['9-8-223']
everything they said is exactly why i was worried about having a kid. and it's true.:::['9-8-224']
and look, everybody knows it. i don't know it.:::['9-8-225']
i wanna have a kid with you because i think you'll be an amazing dad.:::['9-8-226']
at the fun parts and at the hard parts.:::['9-8-227']
well, can you picture me saying, "go to your room, you're grounded"?:::['9-8-228']
can you hear me say, "you're grounded"?:::['9-8-229']
you said that to me last week.:::['9-8-230']
how hard is it? "no shoes on the furniture!":::['9-8-231']
the producer from days left a message asking why i wasn't at the parade.:::['9-8-232']
they said everybody's really pissed off at me. and they all got to meet santa!:::['9-8-233']
it's okay. i thought of the perfect lie for you.:::['9-8-234']
it's easy to remember, and it doesn't invite a lot of questions.:::['9-8-235']
you weren't at the parade, because you had a family emergency.:::['9-8-236']
i like that! yeah!:::['9-8-237']
i wasn't at the parade, because i had a family emergency.:::['9-8-238']
my sister's raccoon came... no, nothing with a raccoon!:::['9-8-240']
wait, what are you doing? setting the table.:::['9-8-241']
we thought it might be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.:::['9-8-242']
how nice. maybe later we can all blow our noses on my wedding dress.:::['9-8-243']
hey, dude, you okay? sorry about before.:::['9-8-244']
that's okay. you're totally right. i don't know anything about disciplining a child.:::['9-8-245']
but it did hurt my feelings, and i want you to know that if i die......you don't get joey.:::['9-8-246']
in case you hadn't noticed, i'm not talking to you.:::['9-8-247']
you know, this is just... this is classic rachel.:::['9-8-248']
right. remember in high school when i died and didn't give you my baby?:::['9-8-249']
this might be my one chance to have a child, rachel.:::['9-8-250']
i mean, you know that i have been so busy focusing on my career...:::['9-8-251']
what career? i'm a decorator.:::['9-8-252']
you decorate dad's office and now you're a decorator?:::['9-8-253']
okay, i went to the zoo yesterday, now i'm a koala bear.:::['9-8-254']
why can't you ever be supportive? you want to talk supportive?:::['9-8-255']
you didn't come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby!:::['9-8-256']
you didn't come see me in the hospital when i was getting my lips done!:::['9-8-257']
i did the first time.:::['9-8-258']
you know what? you want to know why i am not giving emily to you?:::['9-8-259']
emma. whose side are you on?!:::['9-8-260']
i'm not giving you emma, because you can't handle the responsibility of a child.:::['9-8-261']
well, how hard could it be? you do it.:::['9-8-262']
ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo.:::['9-8-263']
you wanna know why you don't want me to have the baby?:::['9-8-264']
because you don't want me to be happy.:::['9-8-265']
you have always been jealous of me. jealous of what?:::['9-8-266']
of your lack of responsibility? your immaturity?:::['9-8-267']
your total disregard for other people's feelings?:::['9-8-268']
to name a few.:::['9-8-269']
you've always been like this.:::['9-8-270']
you had to have everything, and i couldn't have anything.:::['9-8-271']
like in junior high, when you stole timmy from me.:::['9-8-272']
i mean, do you even realize how much that hurt me?:::['9-8-273']
timmy was my boyfriend, and you made out with him!:::['9-8-274']
come on, that was 20 years ago. get over it.:::['9-8-275']
i cannot believe that i invited you here today!:::['9-8-276']
yeah, well, you know what i cannot believe? that my so-called sister......gets a 30% discount from ralph:::['9-8-277']
lauren, and i still have to pay retail?:::['9-8-278']
it's 45.:::['9-8-279']
you bitch.:::['9-8-280', '7-13-18', '2-4-59']
you just think you're so perfect......with your new baby:::['9-8-281']
and your small apartment.:::['9-8-282']
well, let me tell you something. your baby isn't even that cute.:::['9-8-283']
too far, amy. too far.:::['9-8-284']
you take that back. no.:::['9-8-285']
take it back! no. what are you gonna do? make me?:::['9-8-286']
hey, man, i work out!:::['9-8-287']
so do i. i do pilates.:::['9-8-288']
i do yoga. bring it on!:::['9-8-289']
put the plates in the boxes! put the plates in the boxes!:::['9-8-290']
did you just push me? yeah, i think i did.:::['9-8-291']
all right, that's it.:::['9-8-292', '2-21-138']
forget the bubble wrap! there isn't time!:::['9-8-293']
frizzy, frizzy, frizzy!:::['9-8-294']
shouldn't we stop this? are you out of your mind?:::['9-8-295']
let's throw some jell-o on them!:::['9-8-296']
gross!:::['9-8-297']
all right, that is it! this is our apartment, and you cannot behave this way!:::['9-8-298']
if you can't act your age, you shouldn't be here at all.:::['9-8-299']
those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones that i picked out......but they're important to monica.:::['9-8-300']
and i want you to apologize to her now.:::['9-8-301']
amy: i'm sorry. rachel: mon, i'm so sorry.:::['9-8-302']
okay. that's better.:::['9-8-303']
now, i want you to apologize to each other and mean it.:::['9-8-304']
by the way, that fight was totally arousing.:::['9-8-306']
dude, well done.:::['9-8-307']
if i die and rachel dies and monica dies, you can totally take care of emma.:::['9-8-308']
yeah? well, thanks.:::['9-8-309']
so... so now do i get joey?:::['9-8-310']
okay. but you should know he eats a lot and shoves pennies up his nose.:::['9-8-311']
are you okay, mon? uh-huh.:::['9-8-312']
i mean, these things happen. i mean, it's just a plate.:::['9-8-313']
it's not like somebody died. it's all right. you can mourn.:::['9-8-314']
thank you. it was so beautiful!:::['9-8-315']
i'm gonna go to joey's and get the pies.:::['9-8-316']
actually, not pies. it's just pie.:::['9-8-317']
oh, my god, i've lost the will to scold.:::['9-8-319']
rachel: look, amy......we got a little......a little out-of-control over there.:::['9-8-320']
and i'm sorry.:::['9-8-321', '3-4-330']
you're my sister......and if it really means:::['9-8-322']
that much to you...:::['9-8-323']
so you're gonna give me the baby? no, i was...:::['9-8-324']
i was gonna let you use my ralph lauren discount.:::['9-8-325']
you are not gonna regret this.:::['9-8-326']
she needs changing. no, no, no. i'll get her.:::['9-8-327']
i am super confident, totally responsible and fourth in line to raise emma.:::['9-8-328']
i'll be right there, emma! just let me get my trusty diaper bag here.:::['9-8-329']
well, what do you know? i guess i'll be the one who dies first.:::['9-8-330']
does monica know about her plates? chandler: nope.:::['9-8-331']
broke them all, huh? yep.:::['9-8-332']
you gonna tell her? nope.:::['9-8-333']
hey. so i'm gonna put the plates back.:::['9-8-334']
i think you're right. we shouldn't use these plates for a long time.:::['9-8-335']
like only if the queen comes? maybe not even then.:::['9-8-336']
hey. i did it.:::['9-8-337']
i told my producer i had a family emergency. he totally bought it.:::['9-8-338']
thanks for teaching me how to lie. no problem. next week, stealing.:::['9-8-339']
bye, plates. you told her you broke all the plates?:::['9-8-340']
what?! something happened with the plates?:::['9-8-341']
yeah, this raccoon came in...:::['9-8-342']
phoebe: he sprang to his sleigh to his team gave a whistle:::['9-10-0']
and away they all flew like the down of a thistle:::['9-10-1']
but i heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight:::['9-10-2']
"merry christmas to all and to all a good night.":::['9-10-3']
wow. that was great. mm-hm. you really wrote that?:::['9-10-4']
say goodbye, elves. i'm off to tulsa. all: aw.:::['9-10-6']
i can't believe you're not gonna be here for christmas.:::['9-10-7']
you're really not coming back?:::['9-10-8']
yeah, we have this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year.:::['9-10-9']
if i don't get it done, i'll be fired. it's so unfair.:::['9-10-10']
you don't even like your job. so? who does?:::['9-10-11']
i like my job. i love my job.:::['9-10-12']
i can't wait to go back to work. i can't get enough dinosaurs.:::['9-10-13']
i'm sorry i won't be here.:::['9-10-14']
it's just hard enough not seeing you during the week......but for christmas...:::['9-10-15']
if this is what you have to do, i understand.:::['9-10-16']
i'll see you new year's day.:::['9-10-18']
you're not gonna be here new year's eve?:::['9-10-19']
did i not mention that? no.:::['9-10-20']
and to all a good night.:::['9-10-21']
all right, everybody. i know that it is christmas eve......and you'd rather be with your families,but there is no call for writing::::['9-10-22']
"screw you, mr. bing" on the back of my chair.:::['9-10-23']
by the way, you can all call me chandler.:::['9-10-24']
hey. hey. where you been?:::['9-10-25']
i was, uh, checking out that insurance company's christmas party on three.:::['9-10-26']
it was really beautiful. they have all these decorations and this huge tree.:::['9-10-27']
and i just thought, to hell with them, we have to work.:::['9-10-28']
so i stole their ham.:::['9-10-29']
you hear that? you may not be with your families......but at least it's gonna smell like ham:::['9-10-30']
in here.:::['9-10-31', '2-17-27']
my kid's in a play right now.:::['9-10-32']
you know what? i know what will cheer you guys up.:::['9-10-33']
i had a talk with the boys in new york.:::['9-10-34']
i told them about all the hard work you've been doing... ...and that a little christmas bonus may be in order.:::['9-10-35']
"a donation has been made in your name to the new york city ballet.":::['9-10-36', '9-10-313']
well, that's like money in your pocket.:::['9-10-37']
all right, look, you want me to say it? this sucks.:::['9-10-38']
being here sucks. this work sucks.:::['9-10-39']
now it feels like christmas.:::['9-10-40']
hey, at least you get to go home and be with your families tonight.:::['9-10-42']
i have to back to an empty hotel room and lay down......on a very questionable bedspread.:::['9-10-43']
then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses.:::['9-10-44']
which, by the way, none of you have invited me to.:::['9-10-45']
you can come to my house. ha, ha. no, thanks.:::['9-10-46']
it was a nice pep talk. oh, thanks.:::['9-10-47']
i'm actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.:::['9-10-48']
so if you were home right now, what would you be doing?:::['9-10-49']
typical christmassy stuff, you know. our holidays are pretty traditional.:::['9-10-50']
so here's a very special holiday song......that i wrote for some:::['9-10-51']
very important people to me.:::['9-10-52']
went to the store, sat on santa's lap:::['9-10-53']
asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap:::['9-10-54', '4-10-325']
said all you need is to write them a song:::['9-10-55', '4-10-326']
they haven't heard it yet so don't try to sing along:::['9-10-56']
no don't sing along:::['9-10-57']
monica, monica have a happy hanukkah:::['9-10-58']
saw santa claus he said hello to ross:::['9-10-59']
and please tell joey christmas will be snowy:::['9-10-60']
and rachel and chandler:::['9-10-61', '4-10-335']
happy holidays, everybody.:::['9-10-62']
okay, pheebs, look in the kitchen. i'll look in the back closet.:::['9-10-63']
yeah. chandler, why don't you take a walk?:::['9-10-65']
this doesn't concern you.:::['9-10-66']
we are looking for our christmas presents from monica.:::['9-10-67']
chandler: what? that's terrible. no, no. we do it every year.:::['9-10-68']
no. yeah, we never find them. she's always bested us, that wily......minx.:::['9-10-70']
don't worry. we're gonna search here for an hour......and then we're gonna go to joey's:::['9-10-71']
and search. okay?:::['9-10-72']
no, not okay. you can't look for monica's presents.:::['9-10-73']
no, we have to. no, you don't have to.:::['9-10-74']
and you can't, because i live here too.:::['9-10-75']
well, then you should look with us. why?:::['9-10-76']
chandler, aren't you worried about what to get monica for christmas?:::['9-10-77']
no, i have a great idea for a present for her.:::['9-10-78']
oh, pfft. that's it? a great idea again?:::['9-10-79']
chandler, that's not enough. what if she gets you a great present......two medium presents:::['9-10-80']
and a bunch of little presents......and you got her one great present?:::['9-10-81']
that's just gonna make her feel bad.:::['9-10-82']
why would you do that to her, chandler? why? why?:::['9-10-83']
if i helped, we could find them faster. that's right.:::['9-10-84']
ooh, ooh, we have a live one. it's a macy's bag.:::['9-10-85']
oh. ooh. who's it for?:::['9-10-87']
"dear losers: do you really think i'd hide presents under the couch?:::['9-10-88']
rach, these are for you.:::['9-10-90', '2-9-357']
wiper blades. i don't even have a car.:::['9-10-91']
no, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.:::['9-10-92']
okay, pheebs, your turn.:::['9-10-93', '2-9-361']
ah. toilet seat covers.:::['9-10-94']
is that what you were doing while i was getting gas?:::['9-10-95', '2-9-363']
and for ross, mr. sweet tooth.:::['9-10-97']
you got me a cola drink? and... a lemon-lime.:::['9-10-98']
wow. well, this... this is too much.:::['9-10-99']
i feel like i should get you another sweater.:::['9-10-100']
and last, but not least...:::['9-10-101']
they're ribbed, for your pleasure.:::['9-10-102']
well, hey, ben.:::['9-10-103']
what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?:::['9-10-104']
cool.:::['9-10-105', '10-11-287']
monica: come on, ben.:::['9-10-106', '7-10-221']
years and years ago, there were these people called the maccabees.:::['9-10-107']
ho, ho, ho! merry christmas.:::['9-10-108']
ben: santa. hey.:::['9-10-109']
what are you doing here, santa?:::['9-10-110', '7-10-226']
well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben.:::['9-10-111']
what are you doing here......weird turtle-man?:::['9-10-112']
i'm the holiday armadillo, your part-jewish friend.:::['9-10-113']
you sent me here to give ben some presents.:::['9-10-114', '7-10-230']
remember?:::['9-10-115', '7-10-231']
okay, ben, why don't you open some more presents?:::['9-10-117']
santa, the armadillo and i will have a talk in the kitchen.:::['9-10-118', '7-10-239']
there's a sentence i never thought i'd say.:::['9-10-119', '7-10-240']
you called everyone and said you had trouble finding a santa costume......so i borrowed one:::['9-10-121']
from a guy at work.:::['9-10-122', '7-10-243']
thank you, but you gotta leave.:::['9-10-123', '7-10-244']
why? because......i'm finally getting him excited:::['9-10-124', '7-10-245']
about hanukkah.:::['9-10-125', '7-10-265']
and you're wrecking it.:::['9-10-126']
but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.:::['9-10-127']
i'm sorry, chandler, but this is really important to me.:::['9-10-128', '7-10-248']
okay, fine. i'll give the suit back.:::['9-10-129']
hey, you think you can keep it another night?:::['9-10-130', '7-10-250']
santa? really?:::['9-10-131']
yeah, is that okay? did your dad ever dress up like santa?:::['9-10-132']
no. then it's okay.:::['9-10-133']
you know what, everybody?:::['9-10-134']
go home. you should be with your families.:::['9-10-135']
it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.:::['9-10-136']
did i not tell anyone about new year's eve?:::['9-10-137']
all right, look, go. go home, okay? merry christmas. go.:::['9-10-138']
all: merry christmas. chandler: peace on earth.:::['9-10-139']
all: bye. good. godspeed, good people.:::['9-10-140']
you're not gonna go? nah. i couldn't leave you alone.:::['9-10-141']
oh. thanks.:::['9-10-142', '5-19-111']
besides, i can't leave until that christmas party downstairs clears out.:::['9-10-143']
there are some pissed-off insurance people looking for that ham.:::['9-10-144']
chandler bing. hi, honey. we're all here.:::['9-10-146']
we just want to wish you a merry christmas.:::['9-10-147']
all: merry christmas.:::['9-10-148']
aw, merry christmas. i miss you guys.:::['9-10-149']
so is it horrible? is everybody working really hard?:::['9-10-150']
uh, well, no, it's just, uh, me and wendy.:::['9-10-151']
wendy? that sounds like a girl's name.:::['9-10-152']
it is. did i not tell you about her?:::['9-10-153']
mm-hm. about the time you told me about new year's eve.:::['9-10-154']
where's everybody else? chandler: i sent them home.:::['9-10-155']
oh, you are such a good boss. is she pretty?:::['9-10-156']
uh... uh... answer faster. answer faster.:::['9-10-157']
i don't know. answer better. answer better.:::['9-10-158']
i don't think of her that way. i mean, she's a, uh, colleague.:::['9-10-159']
what does she do there? oh, she's regional vice president.:::['9-10-160']
she's just below me. she did what?:::['9-10-161']
below me.:::['9-10-162']
oh, wait, is wendy the runner-up miss oklahoma?:::['9-10-163']
well, she didn't win.:::['9-10-165']
all right, well, maybe i should let you......and the second-prettiest girl:::['9-10-166']
in oklahoma get back to work.:::['9-10-167']
well, second prettiest that year. of all the girls in oklahoma, she's probably...:::['9-10-168']
chandler, stop talking.:::['9-10-169']
honey, there's really nothing to worry about.:::['9-10-170']
okay. i'm serious.:::['9-10-171']
merry christmas. merry christmas.:::['9-10-173']
merry christmas, you guys. all: merry christmas.:::['9-10-174']
the wife says hi. ah. fun conversation?:::['9-10-175']
ah, well, she's just got this weird idea that, uh......just because you and i are alone:::['9-10-176']
something's gonna happen.:::['9-10-177']
huh? really?:::['9-10-178']
hmm. would that be so terrible?:::['9-10-179']
this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about......but you're getting ham:::['9-10-180']
on my only tie.:::['9-10-181']
whoa, back off, missy. ha, ha. missy?:::['9-10-182']
i don't know. i'm not used to girls making passes at me.:::['9-10-183']
wait a minute. am i sexy in oklahoma?:::['9-10-184']
you are to me. no. no. no.:::['9-10-185']
look, i'm married. so? i'm married.:::['9-10-186']
i'm happily married.:::['9-10-187']
oh. what's that like?:::['9-10-188']
right. so i'm sorry, but... seriously? happily married?:::['9-10-189']
so that phone call before, that was happy?:::['9-10-190']
well, look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart.:::['9-10-191']
she's entitled to be a little paranoid.:::['9-10-192']
or, in this case, right on the money.:::['9-10-193']
you know, she's amazing and beautiful and smart.:::['9-10-194']
and if she were here right now, she'd kick your ass.:::['9-10-195']
look, you're a really nice person, ham stealing and adultery aside.:::['9-10-196']
but what i have with my wife is pretty great.:::['9-10-197']
so nothing's ever gonna happen between us.:::['9-10-198']
okay, let me ask you something.:::['9-10-199']
if what you and your wife have is so great......then why are you spending:::['9-10-200']
christmas with me?:::['9-10-201']
you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight.:::['9-10-202', '7-16-172']
really? are you kidding?:::['9-10-203']
you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms.:::['9-10-204']
whoa, whoa, whoa. what's going on? you and i just made out.:::['9-10-205']
you and i are making out? well, not anymore.:::['9-10-206']
but we don't do that. i know. i just thought it would be fun.:::['9-10-207']
how drunk are you? drunk enough that i know i wanna do this.:::['9-10-208']
not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.:::['9-10-209']
that's a perfect amount.:::['9-10-210']
you know what's weird? what?:::['9-10-211', '7-16-181']
this doesn't feel weird. i know.:::['9-10-212', '7-16-182']
you're a really good kisser. well, i have kissed over four women.:::['9-10-213', '7-16-183']
you wanna get under the covers? uh-huh.:::['9-10-214']
wow, you are really fast.:::['9-10-216']
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.:::['9-10-217', '7-16-187']
we're gonna see each other naked. yep.:::['9-10-218', '7-16-188']
you want to do it at the same time? count of three?:::['9-10-219']
one. two.:::['9-10-220']
three.:::['9-10-221']
well, i think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.:::['9-10-222']
eh, we weren't that close anyway.:::['9-10-223']
so are you really gonna go out with that nurse-man?:::['9-10-224']
well, uh, you and i are just goofing around.:::['9-10-225']
i thought, why not just goof around with him?:::['9-10-226']
i don't know if you've ever looked up the term "goofing around" in the dictionary.:::['9-10-227']
well, i have.:::['9-10-228']
and the technical definition is two friends......who care a lot about each other:::['9-10-229']
and have amazing sex......and just want to spend:::['9-10-230']
more time together.:::['9-10-231']
but if you have this newfangled dictionary that gets you mad at me......then we have to, you know,get you my original dictionary.:::['9-10-232']
i am so bad at this.:::['9-10-233', '5-3-293']
i think you're better than you think you are.:::['9-10-234']
really? okay. so if...? know when to stop.:::['9-10-235']
you know, i sensed that i should stop.:::['9-10-236']
so we're okay? yeah.:::['9-10-237', '5-3-297']
don't do the dance. right.:::['9-10-238', '5-3-299']
i can't get married without something old, something new......something borrowed, something blue.:::['9-10-239']
here's something blue and new.:::['9-10-241', '5-24-267']
you are so efficient. i love you.:::['9-10-242', '5-24-268']
let's go. no, no, wait.:::['9-10-243']
we need something old.:::['9-10-244', '5-24-270']
okay. i have a condom in my wallet that i've had since i was 12.:::['9-10-245']
that'll work.:::['9-10-246', '5-24-272']
okay. now we just need something borrowed.:::['9-10-248']
here, just take this. that's stealing.:::['9-10-249', '5-24-275']
we'll bring it back. just put it under your dress.:::['9-10-250']
okay, one thing at a time.:::['9-10-252']
listen, um......i've been thinking.:::['9-10-253', '7-2-229']
it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding.:::['9-10-254']
i mean, you work... you work really hard for that.:::['9-10-255']
well... well, you work for that.:::['9-10-256']
look, i've thought about it too. and......i'm sorry. i think we should spend:::['9-10-257']
all of the money on the wedding.:::['9-10-258']
you do? yeah. i'm putting my foot down.:::['9-10-259']
yeah, look, when i proposed......i told you that i would do anything:::['9-10-260']
to make you happy.:::['9-10-261', '7-2-237']
and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then...:::['9-10-262']
then that's what we're gonna do.:::['9-10-263']
you are so sweet.:::['9-10-264', '7-2-239', '4-17-121']
but wait. what about our...? what about the future and stuff?:::['9-10-265']
ah, forget about the future and stuff. so we only have two kids.:::['9-10-266']
you know, we'll pick our favorite, and that one will get to go to college.:::['9-10-267']
you've thought about that? yeah.:::['9-10-268']
how many kids were we gonna have? uh, four. a boy, twin girls......and another boy.:::['9-10-269']
what else did you think about? well, heh......stuff like where we'd live, you know.:::['9-10-270']
like a small place outside the city where our kids could ride their bikes and stuff.:::['9-10-271']
you know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar......and we could hear it every time:::['9-10-272']
it ran through the little kitty door.:::['9-10-273', '7-2-253']
of course we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.:::['9-10-274', '7-2-254']
i don't... i don't want a big, fancy wedding.:::['9-10-276']
sure you do. no.:::['9-10-277', '7-2-257']
i want everything that you've just said.:::['9-10-278']
i want a marriage.:::['9-10-279']
you sure? mm-hm.:::['9-10-280', '7-2-259']
i love you so much. i love you.:::['9-10-281', '7-2-260']
ah! oh, i love it. really? you're not gonna return it?:::['9-10-282']
well, not this second.:::['9-10-283']
hey, look, you guys. it's snowing.:::['9-10-284']
oh, wow, it's so beautiful. wow, it really is.:::['9-10-286']
rachel: ah.:::['9-10-287']
wendy's a fat-girl name.:::['9-10-288']
phoebe: aren't we done with that?:::['9-10-289']
okay, fine. fine. let's talk about snow.:::['9-10-290']
do you think it's snowing in tulsa... ...where my husband's having sex on a copying machine?:::['9-10-291']
hey. oh, my god.:::['9-10-292']
joey: hey. rachel: aw.:::['9-10-293']
hey. look at that. it's a christmas miracle.:::['9-10-294']
what are you doing here? i wanted to be with you.:::['9-10-295']
i missed you so much.:::['9-10-296', '9-17-260']
hey, hey, uh, who'd you miss the most? monica.:::['9-10-297']
i never wanna leave you again. but i thought if you left, you'd get fired.:::['9-10-299']
turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.:::['9-10-300']
what? what? you...? you really quit your job?:::['9-10-301']
yeah. it was a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you.:::['9-10-302']
and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do... ...what he really wants to do?:::['9-10-303']
well, what do you really wanna do? i have not thought this through.:::['9-10-304']
oh, my god. i know. i should've talked to you first.:::['9-10-305']
no, i think that this is what you wanna do. i think it's great.:::['9-10-306']
chandler, your being here is the best christmas present i could ever imagine.:::['9-10-308']
now give me my real gift. chandler: yeah.:::['9-10-310']
phoebe: thank you. here, pass those around.:::['9-10-311']
ross: oh, hey.:::['9-10-312']
how did you know?:::['9-10-314', '7-8-220']
what? are you kidding? i can't return this.:::['9-10-315']
i thought it was time we started thinking about other people.:::['9-10-316']
and besides, this gift still says i love you guys.:::['9-10-317']
mine says, "to lillian myers." i don't have a job.:::['9-10-318']
actuary? no.:::['9-10-319']
bookkeeper? hmm, no.:::['9-10-320']
topless dancer?:::['9-10-321']
hey, you know what i just realized? you are the sole wage earner.:::['9-10-322']
you are the head of the household. i don't do anything. i'm a kept man.:::['9-10-323']
you are.:::['9-10-324']
honey, here's 20 bucks.:::['9-10-325']

you're gonna get me good and pregnant.:::['9-11-3']
i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed.:::['9-11-4']
i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.:::['9-11-5']
well, i just lost my erection.:::['9-11-6']
no, i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?:::['9-11-7']
you're supposed to find your passion in life.:::['9-11-8']
you can be whatever you want to be now. it's exciting.:::['9-11-9']
yeah, but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start.:::['9-11-10']
hey, wait a second. i can help you with this.:::['9-11-11']
you just need to be organized. we can make a list of your qualifications......and categorize jobs by industry.:::['9-11-12']
there could be folders and files...:::['9-11-13']
hey, this is where your hyper-organized pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off.:::['9-11-14']
my erection is back!:::['9-11-16']
ooh, joey, could i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?:::['9-11-18']
uh, pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian?:::['9-11-21']
i'm sorry. it's just, i'm a little short on cash.:::['9-11-22']
oh, if you want, i could loan you some money.:::['9-11-23']
oh, no, no, no. i learned never to borrow money from friends.:::['9-11-24']
no. that's why richard dreyfuss and i don't speak anymore.:::['9-11-25']
ooh, hey, how about this? wanna be an extra on my show?:::['9-11-26']
you could do that? yeah, yeah.:::['9-11-27']
the pay's pretty good, and you could do it for as long as you need.:::['9-11-28']
oh, my god. i'm gonna be on tv! okay, now...:::['9-11-29']
i gotta tell you, being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.:::['9-11-30']
oh, really? no, it is awesome.:::['9-11-31']
joey: hey. hi.:::['9-11-33', '5-15-177']
hey, why are you all dressed up?:::['9-11-35']
we're bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone.:::['9-11-36']
doesn't she look cute? she sure does.:::['9-11-37']
why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?:::['9-11-38']
if one more person says, "what a cute little boy"......i'm gonna whip them:::['9-11-39']
with a car antenna.:::['9-11-40']
i think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh?:::['9-11-41']
yeah, she's gonna be hotter than, uh, peasant blouses and a-line skirts.:::['9-11-42']
can i get a blue bow?:::['9-11-43']
okay. i have looked through a bunch of career guides......photocopied and highlighted:::['9-11-44']
key passages......and put them into alphabetical folders,so you can make an informed decision.:::['9-11-45']
okay, let's start with the a's. advertising.:::['9-11-47']
wait. advertising, that's a great idea.:::['9-11-48']
well, don't you wanna look through the rest?:::['9-11-49']
i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense.:::['9-11-50']
i'm sorry you had to waste all this time.:::['9-11-51']
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time?:::['9-11-52']
ooh, now i'll get to use my shredder!:::['9-11-53']
i mean, i could write slogans. i mean, how hard could it be, right?:::['9-11-54']
"cheese.:::['9-11-55']
it's milk that you chew.":::['9-11-56']
"crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy.":::['9-11-57']
"a grape. because who can get a watermelon in your mouth?":::['9-11-58']
oh, i got one.:::['9-11-59']
"socks. because your family's feet deserve the best.":::['9-11-60']
honey, leave it to the pros.:::['9-11-61']
i actually know someone in advertising.:::['9-11-62']
i grew up with a guy who is a vice president at a big agency.:::['9-11-63']
maybe i can get him to meet you. give me the phone.:::['9-11-64']
"the phone. bringing you closer to people who have phones.":::['9-11-65']
"marriage. it's not for everybody.":::['9-11-66']
that went well. almost everybody knew that she was a girl.:::['9-11-67']
yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.:::['9-11-68']
i'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff.:::['9-11-69']
who the hell are you? who the hell are you?:::['9-11-70']
i'm the hell person whose office this is.:::['9-11-71']
good one, rach.:::['9-11-72']
i'm gavin mitchell, the person who's taking over your job.:::['9-11-73']
oh, your baby's so cute.:::['9-11-75']
but why would you put a pink bow on a boy?:::['9-11-76']
hey, joey. look at me.:::['9-11-77']
i'm a nurse.:::['9-11-78']
yes, you are. ha, ha.:::['9-11-79']
i think it might be time for my sponge bath.:::['9-11-80']
sorry, i'm just so used to hitting on the extras.:::['9-11-81']
so are you excited about your scene? yeah, but i'm a little nervous.:::['9-11-82']
oh, relax. don't be. they'll probably just make you stand in the background.:::['9-11-83']
good. you. here, come here. here.:::['9-11-84']
take this tray, stand on this yellow mark. you're gonna move on "action.":::['9-11-85']
walk over to the operating table, stop on the blue mark and put the tray down.:::['9-11-86']
don't walk too fast.:::['9-11-87']
but don't dawdle.:::['9-11-88']
okay. now, what?:::['9-11-89']
and, action!:::['9-11-90', '9-11-94']
director: cut! cut. i'm sorry.:::['9-11-91']
i'm sorry. i'm just a little nervous. yeah, well, don't be.:::['9-11-92']
okay, that helps.:::['9-11-93']
director: cut!:::['9-11-95', '7-15-71', '2-13-336', '2-13-338']
don't worry about it. it usually takes me three takes too.:::['9-11-96']
ha-ha-ha. all right, eight.:::['9-11-97']
director: and......action!:::['9-11-98']
so do you have any other questions about advertising?:::['9-11-99']
no. no. but let me show you what i can do.:::['9-11-100']
"bagels and doughnuts.:::['9-11-101']
round food for every mood.":::['9-11-102']
monica warned me you might do that.:::['9-11-103']
i think we might have something for you at the agency.:::['9-11-104']
really? that's great. it's an unpaid internship.:::['9-11-105']
that's funny. when you said "unpaid," it sounded like you said "unpaid.":::['9-11-106']
come on, now. monica has a good job.:::['9-11-107']
it's not like you have a family to support.:::['9-11-108']
actually, we're trying. i don't think monica is gonna want to postpone it.:::['9-11-109']
we're supposed to have sex tonight.:::['9-11-110']
actually, she's probably at home, naked right now.:::['9-11-111']
i tend to keep talking till somebody stops me.:::['9-11-112']
i can picture her on the bed. stop!:::['9-11-113']
wait. what do you mean, you're taking over my job?:::['9-11-115']
well, while you were on your baby vacation, i was doing your job.:::['9-11-116']
a vacation? my idea of a vacation does not involve......something sucking on my nipples:::['9-11-117']
until they are raw.:::['9-11-118']
clearly, you've never been to sandals paradise island.:::['9-11-119']
all right. don't get too comfortable there, because i'm back in two weeks.:::['9-11-120']
i want everything back the way it was.:::['9-11-121']
i can't say i care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.:::['9-11-122']
i can't say i care too much for that smell you've brought in.:::['9-11-123']
uh, rach, uh, we have a code brown situation.:::['9-11-125']
honey, could you please take care of it for me?:::['9-11-126']
all right, but you're gonna have to do one sometime.:::['9-11-127']
let me just get this straight.:::['9-11-128']
so i go have a baby, and they send some guy in to do my job?:::['9-11-129']
well, there was talk of shutting down ralph lauren altogether.:::['9-11-130']
okay. right. you're very cheeky for a temp.:::['9-11-131']
i'm not a temp. i was transferred here from another department.:::['9-11-132']
oh, and what department was that? the, uh, jerk department?:::['9-11-133']
they didn't tell me about your quick wit.:::['9-11-134']
well, did they mention that i'm rubber and you're glue?:::['9-11-135']
gavin, ralph loved your ideas. oh, hi, mr. zelner.:::['9-11-136']
ah, rachel. i see you've met gavin.:::['9-11-137']
when you left us, we weren't sure what we were gonna do.:::['9-11-138']
but then, gavin to the rescue. super gavin. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-11-139']
well, that's great.:::['9-11-140']
so now, uh, super gavin, when i come back......uh, where do you plan:::['9-11-141']
on flying off to?:::['9-11-142']
that's up to mr. zelner. i'm sure he'll make the right decision.:::['9-11-143']
oh, wow. super ass-kissing power.:::['9-11-144']
incidentally, when, uh, are you coming back?:::['9-11-145']
uh, today.:::['9-11-146']
you said two weeks. no, i said today.:::['9-11-147']
see, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.:::['9-11-148']
so, what'd he say?:::['9-11-150']
he can be a little rough around the edges......so i'm gonna replace a word:::['9-11-152']
he used a lot with the word "puppy.":::['9-11-153']
okay? so he said, "if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together......i am gonna fire:::['9-11-154']
her mother-puppy ass.":::['9-11-155']
i'm sorry. i can't do this. i'm just not an actor.:::['9-11-156']
that's right. you're not. you're a nurse.:::['9-11-157']
you're nurse with tray. joey...:::['9-11-158']
nurse with tray doesn't know joey. she has no time for friends.:::['9-11-159']
she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor......because if she doesn't, people die.:::['9-11-160']
who dies?:::['9-11-161']
man with eye patch!:::['9-11-162']
now, you get in there, and you do your job.:::['9-11-163']
yes, doctor. okay.:::['9-11-164']
okay, let's try this one more time.:::['9-11-165']
hang in there, man with eye patch. your tray is coming.:::['9-11-166']
and, action.:::['9-11-167', '9-11-259']
yes, i did it! i nailed it!:::['9-11-168']
what's next?:::['9-11-170']
the rest of the scene.:::['9-11-171']
okay, from the top, people.:::['9-11-172']
listen, sudden change of plans. um, my maternity leave just ended.:::['9-11-173']
they said if i didn't come back today, they'd fire me.:::['9-11-174']
what? no, that's illegal.:::['9-11-175']
i'll have the labor department here so fast, they won't...:::['9-11-176']
all right, calm down, norma rae. they didn't actually say that.:::['9-11-177']
i'm just afraid if i don't come back now, this guy will try and squeeze me out.:::['9-11-178']
but what about emma? i mean, we don't have a nanny.:::['9-11-179']
i know. we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight.:::['9-11-180']
can you please just take care of her for today?:::['9-11-181']
absolutely. just give me your breasts, and we'll be on our way.:::['9-11-182']
come on. i don't know what else to do.:::['9-11-183']
fine. fine. okay.:::['9-11-184']
we'll have fun, won't we? yes, we will. yes, we...:::['9-11-185']
ross. huh?:::['9-11-186']
you're pretty.:::['9-11-187']
whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a new career from scratch.:::['9-11-188']
it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it.:::['9-11-189']
maybe now's not the right time to be starting a family.:::['9-11-190']
so you have to tell monica you don't want to have a baby right now?:::['9-11-191']
okay, it's baby time. pants off, bing.:::['9-11-194']
didn't see you there, geller.:::['9-11-195']
yeah, ross is here, so...:::['9-11-196']
uh, yeah, uh-huh. yeah.:::['9-11-197']
uh, and i was really hoping that maybe i could hang out.:::['9-11-198']
mm. what do you, uh, feel like doing?:::['9-11-199']
well, uh, we're gonna have sex.:::['9-11-200']
i don't feel like having sex.:::['9-11-201']
uh, maybe, uh... i don't know.:::['9-11-202']
maybe we can watch a movie or something.:::['9-11-203']
uh, let me put it this way::::['9-11-204']
we're having sex whether you're here or not.:::['9-11-205']
pants off, bing.:::['9-11-206']
now that i'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?:::['9-11-207']
well, i've changed your screen saver from that picture of *nsync.:::['9-11-208']
hey, they were popular when i left.:::['9-11-209']
i'm working on this big presentation for tomorrow.:::['9-11-210']
i should be involved in that, so get me up to speed.:::['9-11-211']
that'll take weeks. let me take care of the presentation.:::['9-11-212']
oh, no. i see what you're doing here, all right?:::['9-11-213']
this is my job, buddy. i've had it for five years, and i know how it works.:::['9-11-214']
so why don't you just catch me up? fine.:::['9-11-215']
oh, god. you've totally messed with the back support on my chair.:::['9-11-216']
how do you fix this? you've been here five years.:::['9-11-217']
you figure it out. fine, i will.:::['9-11-218']
all right, fill me in.:::['9-11-219']
do you have a blue tie that would go with this? emma spit up on mine.:::['9-11-221']
oh, yeah, but you have to give it back if i get a job.:::['9-11-222']
of course, by that time, ties will be obsolete......and we'll all be wearing:::['9-11-223']
silver jumpsuits.:::['9-11-224']
hey, good morning, lover. hey.:::['9-11-225']
i gotta say, after last night, i'm a little weak in the knees.:::['9-11-226']
here's an idea. you walk into a room, take a quick scan.:::['9-11-227']
but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.:::['9-11-229']
oh, god, i have to tell you something.:::['9-11-230']
you're not pregnant.:::['9-11-231']
well, that thing that i have to do to make a baby?:::['9-11-233']
i faked it.:::['9-11-234']
what? you faked it?:::['9-11-235']
i don't need a tie.:::['9-11-237']
i mean, it's... it's better open collar, you know?:::['9-11-238']
it's, uh, ahem, it's more casual.:::['9-11-239']
joey. listen, i can't do this. it doesn't make any sense.:::['9-11-240']
yesterday i was a nurse, and today i'm a waitress at a café?:::['9-11-241']
oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. it's okay.:::['9-11-242']
well, it's not okay, because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse.:::['9-11-243']
and now, suddenly, i'm the waitress? that's gonna confuse my fans.:::['9-11-244']
um, um...:::['9-11-245']
well, maybe you are a nurse......but you moonlight as a waitress.:::['9-11-246']
because i'm a single mother supporting my two children.:::['9-11-249']
nice. yeah. yeah.:::['9-11-250']
dr. drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital. wouldn't i come say hi?:::['9-11-252']
no. no, see, uh, you and drake are having a fight.:::['9-11-253']
he slept with you and then never called you.:::['9-11-255']
and i just wanted a new daddy for davey and becky.:::['9-11-256']
okay. okay, from the top.:::['9-11-258']
so i'm surprised you agreed to have lunch with me.:::['9-11-260']
i'm surprised too. but yet, here i am.:::['9-11-261']
director: cut! cut!:::['9-11-262']
what...? what are you doing?:::['9-11-263']
i'm very angry at him because he slept with me and never called me back.:::['9-11-264']
me too. me too!:::['9-11-265']
oh, calm down. she means on the show.:::['9-11-266']
we need some new extras around here.:::['9-11-267']
wow. you're here already.:::['9-11-268']
yes. emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation.:::['9-11-269']
actually, i made a few changes. i think i'm caught up on everything.:::['9-11-270']
so ask me anything.:::['9-11-271']
how do you fix the chair? ugh, except that!:::['9-11-272']
oh, hello, mr. zelner. we are all ready for our presentation this afternoon.:::['9-11-273']
good, because it's in 10 minutes. what? i can't do that. i have the baby.:::['9-11-274']
ross is not gonna pick her up for an hour.:::['9-11-275']
then gavin can give the presentation. we have to do it now.:::['9-11-276']
ralph needs to leave early today. he's going helicopter shopping. heh.:::['9-11-277']
well, there you go, you win. you win.:::['9-11-278']
you get to do the presentation. you'll knock them dead.:::['9-11-279']
no one will remember that i worked here, and then ralph will buy his helicopter......and super gavin will just fly:::['9-11-280']
right alongside of him.:::['9-11-281']
you can do the presentation. no, i can't. i have a baby.:::['9-11-282']
i'll watch her.:::['9-11-283']
because you worked really hard, and it's your job. and you're a little crazy.:::['9-11-285']
that's really nice.:::['9-11-286']
i should tell you that crying women make me very uncomfortable.:::['9-11-287']
well, you're not gonna like what's coming.:::['9-11-288']
i'm sorry, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.:::['9-11-289']
thank you. thank you.:::['9-11-291', '4-1-237', '3-16-157']
um.:::['9-11-292']
i'm really fine. don't worry. i'm great with children.:::['9-11-294']
gavin mitchell. pleased to meet you.:::['9-11-296']
please don't fire my friend. just let me talk to her.:::['9-11-297']
okay, but this is her last chance. thank you.:::['9-11-298']
how about i do something for you?:::['9-11-299']
tomorrow, uh, i'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald.:::['9-11-300']
hey, uh, listen, pheebs. i was just talking to the director......and he was thinking maybe:::['9-11-301']
this time you don't hit drake.:::['9-11-302']
you just wait on the tables.:::['9-11-303']
i can't do that. i'm an actor. i have a process.:::['9-11-304']
you're a masseuse. you have a table with a hole in it.:::['9-11-305']
wait, i see what's happening here. you're threatened.:::['9-11-306']
i'm so good in the scene that i'm stealing focus from you.:::['9-11-308']
well, rise to the challenge, tribbiani, because i just raised the bar.:::['9-11-309']
come join me up here. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-11-310']
yeah, you can fire her, but i would call security. she won't go easy.:::['9-11-311']
you faked it? you couldn't have faked it.:::['9-11-312']
yes, you can. you just make the faces and the noises.:::['9-11-313']
guys can fake it?:::['9-11-314']
ugh, unbelievable. the one thing that's ours.:::['9-11-315']
why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?:::['9-11-316']
well, that's actually why.:::['9-11-317']
look, i'm starting a whole new career now.:::['9-11-318']
i'm not saying i don't want a baby.:::['9-11-319']
i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.:::['9-11-320']
like...? like a month?:::['9-11-321']
or a year? really? you wanna wait a year?:::['9-11-322']
it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff.:::['9-11-323']
"pants. like shorts but longer.":::['9-11-324']
it'll probably be more than a year.:::['9-11-325']
wow. i...:::['9-11-326']
i really wanna have a baby. well, yeah, me too.:::['9-11-327']
look, i'll just get my old job back.:::['9-11-328']
no, i want you to have a job that you love......not statistical analysis:::['9-11-329']
and data reconfiguration.:::['9-11-330']
i quit, and you learn what i do?:::['9-11-331']
i think there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby.:::['9-11-332']
now you're unemployed, and in a little while......you'll find a new job:::['9-11-333']
that'll keep you really busy.:::['9-11-334']
there's always gonna be a reason not to do this......but i think once the baby comes,we'll forget about all those reasons.:::['9-11-335']
i mean, it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.:::['9-11-337']
it's gonna be really scary.:::['9-11-338']
i mean, god, when we have a baby......there's gonna be so much:::['9-11-339']
that we're not able to control.:::['9-11-340']
i mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess.:::['9-11-341']
i won't have time to clean it.:::['9-11-342']
what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer......and messes up all the ribbons?:::['9-11-343']
what if there's no room for a ribbon drawer......because the baby's stuff:::['9-11-344']
takes up all the space?:::['9-11-345']
where will all the ribbons go?:::['9-11-346']
should we go make a baby before you change your mind?:::['9-11-347']
yes, please! okay.:::['9-11-348']
oh, and i promise i will not fake it this time.:::['9-11-349']
well, i wish i could say the same. i'm a little shook up.:::['9-11-350']
i know you botched that operation on purpose.:::['9-11-351']
i can't prove it yet, but when i do, you'll be going to jail for murder.:::['9-11-352']
i don't care if you are my brother.:::['9-11-353']
i'm not your brother.:::['9-11-354']
what about my children, drake? huh?:::['9-11-355']
no! no! no!:::['9-11-356', '10-11-412']
no! no!:::['9-11-357', '7-15-28', '7-15-316', '7-12-44', '10-17-571', '5-1-334', '4-6-247']
god!:::['9-11-358', '7-22-167', '7-6-324', '7-12-246', '2-11-212']
hey. yeah. yeah, okay. sure.:::['9-13-0']
look, can we talk about what happened here last night?:::['9-13-1']
sure. just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you.:::['9-13-2']
you believe that whoever did something last night did what they did or didn't do?:::['9-13-3']
okay, you really don't know what i'm talking about?:::['9-13-4']
no. okay. last night, after the party......i saw rachel kissing that jerk:::['9-13-5']
from her office out on your balcony.:::['9-13-6']
our balcony? seriously?:::['9-13-7']
that's so funny. i told monica we should put lights on our balcony......and she said, "no, no. it's too cold.:::['9-13-8']
nobody will go out there." and i said::::['9-13-9']
"maybe if we put some lights out there they will.":::['9-13-10']
right, that's what i came over to talk about. i saw rachel kissing some guy......on your balcony,even though there were no lights!:::['9-13-11']
so are you gonna talk to her?:::['9-13-12']
why? why should i? i mean, if she wants to move on, that's fine.:::['9-13-13']
you know when "that's fine" sounds true? when someone yells it and spits.:::['9-13-14']
no, i'm serious. i mean, if she wants to date people, fine. i don't care.:::['9-13-15']
but at least she could have told me.:::['9-13-16']
you know, i've been putting my life on hold and concentrating on emma.:::['9-13-17']
but if she wants to go out there kissing guys she barely knows, then so will i.:::['9-13-18']
very funny! ross is gay! ha, ha.:::['9-13-19']
no, no. good, so you're moving on.:::['9-13-20']
do you have any idea where you're moving on to?:::['9-13-21']
i've got plenty of opportunities.:::['9-13-22']
just now, there was some woman at the coffeehouse smiled at me.:::['9-13-23']
and then the other day on the subway, a woman "accidentally" sat on my hand.:::['9-13-24']
dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life.:::['9-13-25']
and there's an anthropologist atschool":::['9-13-26']
...who totally came on to me during the interdepartmental potluck dinner.:::['9-13-27']
why did i get married?:::['9-13-28']
hey, let me ask you guys something.:::['9-13-29']
i'm having new headshots taken tomorrow.:::['9-13-30']
the photographer said she thinks i should have my eyebrows waxed.:::['9-13-31']
is that weird for a guy?:::['9-13-32']
well, it depends. on?:::['9-13-33']
on how far along he is in the sex-change process.:::['9-13-34']
no, i totally disagree. i think it's fine for a guy to do something like that.:::['9-13-35']
especially an actor.:::['9-13-36']
i mean, not that you need to. your eyebrows are...:::['9-13-37']
stop it, you guys. stop staring, you're freaking me out.:::['9-13-38']
your knuckles are kind of hairy too.:::['9-13-39']
oh, man, now i have to get those done too?:::['9-13-40']
wow, talk about high maintenance. you dye your hair.:::['9-13-41']
i'm a woman. double standards!:::['9-13-42']
before i forget, are you coming to mike's piano bar tonight?:::['9-13-43']
only if i don't have to get up and sing. but everybody sings. it's so fun.:::['9-13-44']
last time, this adorable old man got up there, forgot all the words, flipped out......and everyone booed him off the stage.:::['9-13-45']
it was so funny.:::['9-13-46']
look, i'm not good at singing.:::['9-13-47']
oh, what's the matter? you scared? you afraid i'm a better singer?:::['9-13-48']
you afraid i'm gonna beat you at singing?:::['9-13-49']
nope. nope. it's not working on me.:::['9-13-50']
wow, i must be growing up.:::['9-13-51']
okay, fine. just please come and support mike. you don't have to sing.:::['9-13-52']
so i don't have to sing, and i can just sit there and pass judgment on others?:::['9-13-53']
while drinking. i'm there.:::['9-13-54']
hi, you guys. listen, i really need your help.:::['9-13-55']
i think i did something really stupid.:::['9-13-56']
well, yes, rachel, but you got something so beautiful out of it.:::['9-13-57']
no, not that. i kissed gavin last night.:::['9-13-58']
my god. you kissed him?:::['9-13-59']
yeah, it was after the party, we were on the balcony--:::['9-13-60']
wait, wait, wait. i was at home the whole time. how did i miss that?:::['9-13-61']
well, it was the end of the party. you were probably ironing wrapping paper.:::['9-13-62']
so how did you end up kissing?:::['9-13-64']
we were all alone and he was being really nice...:::['9-13-65']
...and he gave me this scarf. i thought you hated him.:::['9-13-66']
well, there is a thin line between love and hate......and it turns out that line:::['9-13-67']
is a scarf.:::['9-13-68']
are you thinking of starting something up with this guy?:::['9-13-69']
i don't know. it's so complicated. i work with this guy.:::['9-13-70']
i have the baby, and i have ross. i don't know what to do.:::['9-13-71']
and i have to be at the office and see gavin in 10 minutes.:::['9-13-72']
sounds like you need to think about what you want and talk to gavin.:::['9-13-73']
and you definitely should talk to ross. or......i could call in sick:::['9-13-74']
and not deal with it at all.:::['9-13-75']
wow! five months maternity leave, you're back for four days......kiss a co-worker and call in sick.:::['9-13-76']
they are lucky to have you.:::['9-13-77']
i'm here for my eyebrow appointment. name?:::['9-13-79']
okay, very good.:::['9-13-81']
have a seat right here, mr. bing, and sonya will be right with you.:::['9-13-82']
okay. thanks. mm-hm.:::['9-13-83']
ooh. ooh, ooh, ooh.:::['9-13-84']
i touched the stuff.:::['9-13-86']
i'll take care of it.:::['9-13-87']
so do you...? do you get a lot of guys in here?:::['9-13-89']
oh, absolutely. oh, good.:::['9-13-90']
you looking to meet somebody? all right, let's just do this.:::['9-13-91']
okay, we'll get to the wax in a minute.:::['9-13-92']
first, i want to tweeze some of the strays, okay?:::['9-13-93']
now, this may sting just a little bit. i have an extremely high threshold--:::['9-13-94']
holy mother of god! oh, my face! my face!:::['9-13-95']
i'm all right. i'm all right. i'm all right.:::['9-13-96']
it's just a bit of shock, that's all.:::['9-13-97']
but i'll be fine. you can go again. okay.:::['9-13-98']
damn it, woman!:::['9-13-100']
qw, ow! oh!:::['9-13-101']
it's the most eligible man in new york. how's the moving on going?:::['9-13-104']
not well. i went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand......but that person was neither female:::['9-13-105']
nor wearing pants.:::['9-13-106']
maybe you're going about this the wrong way. i mean, think about it::::['9-13-107']
single white male, divorced three times, two illegitimate children.:::['9-13-108']
the personal ad writes itself.:::['9-13-109']
you know, that's funny. yeah. so do you think you'll ever work again?:::['9-13-110']
what are you doing? you know i can only dish it out.:::['9-13-111']
i can't believe rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.:::['9-13-112']
maybe she didn't move on.:::['9-13-113']
maybe that kiss was just an impulsive, one-time birthday thing.:::['9-13-114']
no, a month ago, she gave her number to some guy in a bar.:::['9-13-115']
did she go out with him? no. when he called......i threw the message away.:::['9-13-116']
ah, the highroad.:::['9-13-117']
all right, you know what? enough. enough talking. i have to get moving.:::['9-13-118']
hey, check out those two blonds over there. hey, come with me.:::['9-13-119']
are you trying to get everybody divorced?:::['9-13-120']
you don't have to do anything. it'll just be easier if it's two of us.:::['9-13-121']
like college, remember? first, you break the ice with some kind of a joke......so they know you're the funny one. i:::['9-13-122']
swoop in with interesting conversation......so they'll see that i'm the brilliant,brooding sexy one.:::['9-13-123']
i thought i got to make the jokes.:::['9-13-124']
don't you have to be at work? oh, come on.:::['9-13-125']
hello. hi, my name's chandler. this is my friend ross right here.:::['9-13-126']
we were wondering......if you're up for it, we only need:::['9-13-127']
six more people for a human pyramid.:::['9-13-128']
swoop. swoop.:::['9-13-129']
uh... so, um...:::['9-13-130']
hey, i notice you're reading the paper.:::['9-13-131']
another flood in europe, huh?:::['9-13-132']
um, here's a question::::['9-13-133']
would you rather drown or be burned alive?:::['9-13-134']
i'm sorry, we're just leaving. okay.:::['9-13-135']
we still got it.:::['9-13-136']
who is it? gavin: gavin. i brought you some soup.:::['9-13-137']
why? uh, i heard your were sick.:::['9-13-138']
oh, right! hold on, let me just clean up in here a little bit.:::['9-13-139']
hello, gavin.:::['9-13-140']
i missed you at work. how you feeling?:::['9-13-141']
i'm not gonna lie to you, i'm pretty sick.:::['9-13-142']
oh, good. because i was having a totally paranoid moment......where i thought you:::['9-13-143']
called in sick to avoid me.:::['9-13-144']
so i had fun last night.:::['9-13-146']
so did i.:::['9-13-147']
exactly how contagious is this thing you have?:::['9-13-148']
is it a cold from standing on the balcony, or did a monkey bite you?:::['9-13-149']
it's just a cold. do you have a fever?:::['9-13-150']
what? what is it? what's the matter?:::['9-13-153']
what's ross doing to you in that picture?:::['9-13-154']
oh, he's dusting me with a fossil brush.:::['9-13-155']
he thought it would be funny.:::['9-13-156']
right. right. yeah.:::['9-13-157']
ross. yeah.:::['9-13-158']
what's the deal with you guys? i don't wanna get in the middle of anything.:::['9-13-159']
oh, you're not getting in the middle of anything. don't worry about ross.:::['9-13-160']
hide! that's ross! hide!:::['9-13-161']
hide! hide! yeah, but you said not to worry--:::['9-13-162']
i lied and i'm not sick either! just stay behind the curtain!:::['9-13-163']
hi. oh, molly. you're not ross.:::['9-13-164']
no. i'm here to take emma to your mother's, remember?:::['9-13-165']
right. yes, yes.:::['9-13-166']
don't panic. rachel: what?:::['9-13-167']
there is a man behind your curtain.:::['9-13-168']
i have mace in my purse. no, that's okay! no, no, no.:::['9-13-169']
this is my business associate gavin being silly. come out from behind there.:::['9-13-170']
hi. gavin. pleased to meet you.:::['9-13-171']
it was my idea to stand there.:::['9-13-172']
hello. i'll just go get emma. rachel: okay.:::['9-13-173']
...why did i have to hide? i thought it was ross.:::['9-13-175']
i thought there was nothing going on between you.:::['9-13-176']
there isn't. there totally isn't.:::['9-13-177']
you hear keys in the hall and you jump like a bronco coming out of the chute.:::['9-13-178']
i used to be a rodeo clown.:::['9-13-179']
um, all right, look, gavin......i guess i felt guilty:::['9-13-180']
that you were here......which i shouldn't.:::['9-13-181']
you know, ross and i are not in a relationship......but he is the father of my child.:::['9-13-182']
and, you know......we do live together. and plus,there's just so much history, you know?:::['9-13-183']
it's just-- i don't know.:::['9-13-184']
i'm sorry. i'm just all over the place. it's okay.:::['9-13-185']
it's probably not my place, but can i give you a piece of advice?:::['9-13-186']
yes. you should talk to ross about all this.:::['9-13-187']
people keep saying that.:::['9-13-188']
oh, i'm sorry, gavin.:::['9-13-189']
don't be.:::['9-13-190']
it's just bad timing.:::['9-13-191']
so seriously, rodeo clown?:::['9-13-192']
one of the best, ma'am. one of the best.:::['9-13-193']
no time for losers:::['9-13-194']
'cause we are the champions:::['9-13-195']
of the world:::['9-13-196']
oh, she's my girlfriend. that's not just how we do it here.:::['9-13-197']
i'm gonna take a little break, and when we come back......we've got kenneth singing:::['9-13-198']
"i touch myself.":::['9-13-199']
i'm not here to judge.:::['9-13-200']
you have got to sing. no, i told you i can't.:::['9-13-201']
but you would have so much fun. and you have a really nice voice.:::['9-13-202']
when have you heard me sing? all the time, when you're cooking.:::['9-13-203']
what? yeah, you're always singing::::['9-13-204']
"yummy, yummy, yummy, i've got love in my tummy.":::['9-13-205']
yeah, i do rock that one.:::['9-13-206']
isn't there just a little part of you that wants to get up there?:::['9-13-207']
just a little. but, god, it's so scary.:::['9-13-208']
i don't even know what i would sing.:::['9-13-209']
well, i've got a book around-- "delta dawn.":::['9-13-210']
hi. i couldn't help but notice, but that's an unusual necklace.:::['9-13-211']
you already hit on me an hour ago.:::['9-13-212']
right. so that's a firm no?:::['9-13-213']
i don't believe this. i just keep striking out.:::['9-13-214']
i don't get it either.:::['9-13-215']
i mean, you're obviously desperate.:::['9-13-216']
you're asking women how they wanna be killed.:::['9-13-217']
this is great. rachel's gonna keep kissing guys......until she finds the one she wants,and i'm gonna die alone.:::['9-13-218']
by drowning or...?:::['9-13-219']
why would he break up with me? i don't know, sweetie.:::['9-13-220']
all i ever wanted was to just love him and have him love me back.:::['9-13-221']
i mean, am i so unlovable?:::['9-13-222']
all right. that was kenneth with his......much too literal rendition:::['9-13-224']
of "i touch myself.":::['9-13-225']
coming up next, we've got monica singing "delta dawn.":::['9-13-226']
wait. i can't sing in front of all these people.:::['9-13-227']
just pretend they're not even here. it's okay.:::['9-13-228']
once that spotlight hits you, it's so bright, you won't see anyone anyway.:::['9-13-229']
hi, i'm monica. and i'm going to be singing "delta dawn.":::['9-13-230']
what's that flower you have on?:::['9-13-231']
could it be a faded rose from days gone by?:::['9-13-232']
can you totally see through her shirt? like an x-ray.:::['9-13-233']
bad day not to wear a bra.:::['9-13-234']
take me to that mansion in the sky:::['9-13-235', '9-13-259']
joey: hey. i need your help.:::['9-13-236']
wow, it seems serious.:::['9-13-237']
what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?:::['9-13-238']
i'm getting new headshots taken. so i went to get my eyebrows shaped.:::['9-13-239']
i'm sorry. moment to make fun of that, please.:::['9-13-240']
i may be a sissy, but i'll still pound you into the ground.:::['9-13-241']
look, it hurt so bad, i could only let her do one eyebrow, and now......they don't match!:::['9-13-242']
it's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama.:::['9-13-243']
you gotta help me out, okay? look, i have a magic marker.:::['9-13-244']
fill in the skinny one so i don't look stupid for my pictures.:::['9-13-245']
okay, first of all, this is green.:::['9-13-246']
what the hell am i supposed to do?! i will help you out......but you have to promise you won't:::['9-13-247']
tell anyone what i'm about to tell you.:::['9-13-248']
you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn......or taking out the garbage?:::['9-13-251']
well, i earned mine......by plucking the eyebrows of my father:::['9-13-252']
and his "business partners.":::['9-13-253']
yeah, well, i guess you don't need my help, victor-victoria.:::['9-13-255']
no, no, no. i do. i do. i need your help.:::['9-13-256']
but, chandler, i don't know if i can take any more plucking. it hurt so bad.:::['9-13-257']
not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle......self-loathing touch.:::['9-13-258']
crowd: aww...:::['9-13-260']
i'm sorry, the song's over.:::['9-13-261']
did you see me up there? every little bit of you.:::['9-13-262']
i can't believe i sang in front of people and they liked me.:::['9-13-263']
did you hear that guy shouting, "look at those tips"?:::['9-13-264']
i mean, did i really help you get a lot of tips?:::['9-13-265']
mon, not that you didn't sound good... good?:::['9-13-267']
didn't you hear them? i was great!:::['9-13-268']
thank you so much for making me do this. that is the best gift ever.:::['9-13-269']
also a good gift: underwear.:::['9-13-270']
thank you so much for letting me do this.:::['9-13-271']
public bathrooms freak me out. i can't even pee, let alone do anything else.:::['9-13-272']
but what's great is, you don't mind talking about it.:::['9-13-273']
it is so amazing that i met you on the same day that eric broke up with me......because it's like, you lose a boyfriend,and you get a boyfriend.:::['9-13-274']
no, don't worry. this is not some rebound thing. i am totally over eric.:::['9-13-276']
phew.:::['9-13-277']
good choice, ross.:::['9-13-278']
oh, hey. hi. there you are.:::['9-13-279']
i've been looking for you everywhere. hello. well, here i am.:::['9-13-280']
my mom is not bringing the baby back until 9:00.:::['9-13-281']
so i was hoping you and i could have a chance to kind of--:::['9-13-282']
somebody here? oh, yeah. that's michelle.:::['9-13-283']
who? oh, just this woman i've been seeing.:::['9-13-284']
you've been seeing someone? yeah, didn't i mention that?:::['9-13-285']
i mean, we haven't been going out too long......but there's this amazing:::['9-13-286']
connection between us.:::['9-13-287']
i mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend.:::['9-13-288']
i thought it was a little too soon, but also, it felt kind of nice.:::['9-13-289']
what are you taking amoxicillin for?:::['9-13-290']
how great is this? you're already comfortable enough......to look through my stuff.:::['9-13-291']
i'm sorry, michelle, this is my roommate, rachel.:::['9-13-292']
and i'm also emma's mother.:::['9-13-293']
who's emma? i told you about my daughter.:::['9-13-294']
this is your daughter?:::['9-13-295']
i could be your new mommy.:::['9-13-296']
and done.:::['9-13-297']
i didn't feel a thing. hey, are you still looking for a job?:::['9-13-299']
because you could tweeze circles around that sadistic bitch at the salon.:::['9-13-300']
thanks. wanna see what it looks like? yeah.:::['9-13-301']
they totally match. they look great.:::['9-13-303']
they look great. how you doing?:::['9-13-304']
yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was......uncovering a birthmark:::['9-13-305']
right about there......but it turned out to be:::['9-13-306']
a little piece of chocolate.:::['9-13-307']
chandler, thank you so much. no problem.:::['9-13-308']
listen, that was a pretty girlie hour we just spent.:::['9-13-309']
we should do something manly to make up for it.:::['9-13-310']
curl my eyelashes. yeah!:::['9-13-312']
for my next song, i think i'll sing something a little more upbeat, all right?:::['9-13-313']
oh, how about the pointer sisters' "i'm so excited"?:::['9-13-314']
and make it bouncy.:::['9-13-315']
well, you can probably take care of that on your end.:::['9-13-316']
i'm sorry i'm late. you'll understand when you see joey.:::['9-13-317']
honey, you're just in time. i'm about to sing another song.:::['9-13-318']
really? in front of all these people? and they love me.:::['9-13-319']
oh, my god. she gives the people what they want.:::['9-13-320']
all right, watch.:::['9-13-321']
make it happen:::['9-13-322']
tonight we'll put all other things aside:::['9-13-323']
get in this time and show me some affection:::['9-13-324']
are those my wife's nipples?:::['9-13-325']
isn't that funny? i didn't see that before. i wouldn't have let her go up again.:::['9-13-326']
i've got to stop this.:::['9-13-327']
wrap myself around you--:::['9-13-328']
crowd: yeah!:::['9-13-329']
oh, who cares? they still love me.:::['9-13-330']
you, touching yourself! out!:::['9-13-331']
wow! she does that a lot.:::['9-13-332']
ross, you didn't tell me you were a doctor.:::['9-13-333']
wait a minute. you haven't even told her you are a doctor yet?:::['9-13-334']
how long have you known her, like an hour?:::['9-13-335']
actually, about an hour and a half.:::['9-13-336']
i told you it wasn't long, but there's an amazing connection between us.:::['9-13-337']
you feel that too? oh!:::['9-13-338']
i thought that that was just me. are you kidding?:::['9-13-339']
do you wanna go away this weekend? we'll see.:::['9-13-340']
ross, what's going on here?:::['9-13-341']
are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?:::['9-13-342']
i don't know. are we just kissing guys on balconies?:::['9-13-343']
how do you know about that? through the magic of sight.:::['9-13-344']
i was here, putting our child to sleep-- emma.:::['9-13-345']
when i looked through the window and saw you kissing a guy......you've known for what, a week?:::['9-13-346']
god, is that what this is all about? you bring her up here to get back at me?:::['9-13-347']
no, actually, see, i had to pee because i can't use public bathrooms...:::['9-13-348']
...because of the doody parasites. okay, michelle, it's time to go.:::['9-13-349']
well, call me. okay.:::['9-13-350']
wait, you don't have my phone number.:::['9-13-351']
you know what? if it's meant to be, i'll guess it.:::['9-13-352']
did you not like her? because i was hoping we could come......to your kissing parties:::['9-13-355']
on the balcony.:::['9-13-356']
i can't believe you are making a big deal about this. it was one kiss!:::['9-13-357']
one guy. one time! oh, really?:::['9-13-358']
yeah. oh, really?:::['9-13-359']
what about the guy from the bar? who?:::['9-13-361']
the guy you gave your number to.:::['9-13-362']
how do you know about that? because he called here looking for you.:::['9-13-363']
so don't tell me kissing this guy from work is a one-time thing.:::['9-13-364']
because you've been out there in bars and on balconies......for over a month now. and you:::['9-13-365']
don't even have the courtesy to tell me.:::['9-13-366']
why didn't i get that message? what?:::['9-13-367']
from the guy in the bar? why didn't i get that message?:::['9-13-368']
because i folded it up and put it in my pants pocket.:::['9-13-369']
do you--? do you not look there?:::['9-13-370']
i never gave it to you.:::['9-13-372']
i don't know. oh, god, you know what? i don't...:::['9-13-374']
who do you think you are? who are you to decide......what messages:::['9-13-375']
i should or should not get?!:::['9-13-376']
who am i? i'm the guy who's taking care of our baby...:::['9-13-377']
...while you're at bars meeting guys! i cannot believe you.:::['9-13-378']
i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation about us.:::['9-13-379']
but i can't do that with someone who hides my messages......and brings crazy women:::['9-13-380']
back to my apartment!:::['9-13-381']
hey, none of the sane ones wanted to come back with me!:::['9-13-382']
that's not the point, okay? the point is......you are the one who moved on:::['9-13-383']
and didn't tell anyone.:::['9-13-384']
oh, god, ross, this is just so messed up.:::['9-13-385']
what is wrong with us? when people hear about our situation, they ask::::['9-13-386']
"you live together, but you're not a couple, yet you have a baby?:::['9-13-387']
isn't that weird?" and i say, "no. it's not, because it works for us.":::['9-13-388']
but you know what? this doesn't work.:::['9-13-389']
in fact, this is the opposite of working. clearly.:::['9-13-390']
and you know......we said that we would live together:::['9-13-391']
as long as this makes sense......and maybe this:::['9-13-392']
just doesn't make sense anymore.:::['9-13-393']
yeah, maybe not.:::['9-13-394']
so, what do you wanna do?:::['9-13-395']
can emma and i live here for a while?:::['9-13-397']
god. uh...:::['9-13-398']
of course. thank you.:::['9-13-399']
your eyebrows look weird.:::['9-13-400']
jeremiah was a bullfrog:::['9-13-401']
was a good friend of mine:::['9-13-402']
never understood a single word he said:::['9-13-403']
but i helped him drink his wine:::['9-13-404']
so you'll just touch yourself for anything, then?:::['9-13-405']
where's mon? she's at home......putting up decorations:::['9-12-1']
for rachel's birthday party tonight.:::['9-12-2']
and you're not helping? i tried......but apparently singing "i will survive":::['9-12-3']
in a helium voice, not helping.:::['9-12-4']
hey, you guys. joey: hey.:::['9-12-5']
happy birth...:::['9-12-6', '9-12-220']
shh. don't say that loud. gunther's gonna want to hug me.:::['9-12-7']
uh, good news, everyone. we finally found a nanny.:::['9-12-8']
this is molly. molly, chandler, joey. hi.:::['9-12-9']
ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.:::['9-12-10']
you're damn right i am. i've been waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.:::['9-12-11']
okay. you know what, i'm just gonna take her outside.:::['9-12-12']
no, you stay. i'll do it. rachel: okay. thank you.:::['9-12-13']
nice to meet you guys. joey: yeah, you too.:::['9-12-14']
wow, molly's just great. yeah.:::['9-12-15']
yes, bravo on the hot nanny.:::['9-12-16']
what? you really think she's hot? are you kidding?:::['9-12-17']
if i wasn't married, she'd be rejecting me right now.:::['9-12-18']
how do you think she's doing?:::['9-12-20']
am i the only one that doesn't think she's hot? ross?:::['9-12-21']
ah, i mean, she's not unattractive, but... right.:::['9-12-22']
...but hot? ah...:::['9-12-23']
thank you. ha, ha.:::['9-12-24']
now that rachel's gone?:::['9-12-25']
so hot, i cried myself to sleep last night.:::['9-12-26']
hey, mike, what's the capital of peru?:::['9-12-27']
lima. no.:::['9-12-28']
it starts with a v and ends with an x.:::['9-12-29']
and hopefully with a t-o in the middle.:::['9-12-30']
you know, come to think of it, the capital of peru is "vtox.":::['9-12-31']
oh, god! what?:::['9-12-32', '5-17-58']
okay. i don't want to freak you out or anything......but i just saw a rat in your cupboard.:::['9-12-33']
oh, yeah. no, that's bob.:::['9-12-34']
well, he's your pet rat?:::['9-12-35']
well, not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor......who i put food out for.:::['9-12-36']
you know, kind of like santa.:::['9-12-37']
except santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.:::['9-12-38']
you can't keep a rat in your apartment. they're extremely unsanitary.:::['9-12-39']
i mean, they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.:::['9-12-40']
what are those? i don't know......but they don't sound:::['9-12-41']
like spa treatments.:::['9-12-42']
you have to get rid of it. okay, fine.:::['9-12-43']
if it means that much to you, i'll get rid of bob.:::['9-12-44']
it's so weird you think he's so gross, yet you're willing to eat his crackers.:::['9-12-46']
hello. hello.:::['9-12-47', '5-24-250']
gavin, i just want to say thank you again......for watching emma yesterday:::['9-12-48']
during the presentation.:::['9-12-49']
i really owe you an apology.:::['9-12-50']
for what? when we first met, you know......i thought you were pompous:::['9-12-51']
and arrogant and obnoxious.:::['9-12-52']
is this your first apology?:::['9-12-53']
no, i just mean, you know, first impressions don't mean anything.:::['9-12-54']
and i think you're a really good guy. and i'm sorry that i misjudged you.:::['9-12-55']
morning. hello.:::['9-12-56']
but you know what? hey, new day, new leaf.:::['9-12-57']
i am just really, really happy...:::['9-12-58']
i'm sorry. obviously, heather's ass has something more important to say......so i'll just wait till it's finished.:::['9-12-59']
what? i was giving you an apology......and you were totally checking her out.:::['9-12-60']
i wasn't checking her out. i'm in fashion. i was looking at her skirt.:::['9-12-61']
or was it pants? i didn't really see what happened below the ass area.:::['9-12-62']
wow, you are really... you're really a creep.:::['9-12-63']
what do you even care if i was looking at her?:::['9-12-64']
are you jealous?:::['9-12-65', '3-12-322']
oh, yeah. i'm jealous.:::['9-12-66']
"oh, gavin. please, please look at my ass.":::['9-12-67']
stop looking at my ass.:::['9-12-68']
i mean, i just think you are totally inappropriate. okay?:::['9-12-69']
this is a work environment. she's your subordinate.:::['9-12-70']
but it was okay when you slept with your old assistant, tag?:::['9-12-71']
that is totally different for two reasons.:::['9-12-72']
one, i didn't know that you knew that.:::['9-12-73']
and two, i wasn't some creep staring at his ass.:::['9-12-74']
we had a... we had a deep, meaningful relationship.:::['9-12-75']
huh. what was tag's last name?:::['9-12-76']
it was...:::['9-12-77']
he didn't have a last name.:::['9-12-79']
it was just tag, you know, like cher or......you know, moses.:::['9-12-80']
but it was a deep, meaningful relationship.:::['9-12-81']
you know what? my first impression of you was absolutely right.:::['9-12-82']
you are arrogant. you are pompous. morgan! morgan!:::['9-12-83']
tag's last name was morgan! ha! it was jones.:::['9-12-84']
what are you, his boyfriend?:::['9-12-85']
man, i wish i had a nanny like you. you mean when you were a baby?:::['9-12-86']
would you stop staring at her?:::['9-12-88']
i wasn't staring.:::['9-12-89']
i was leering.:::['9-12-90']
what's the big deal with her?:::['9-12-91']
maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.:::['9-12-92']
yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.:::['9-12-93']
you know, when it's right there in your face.:::['9-12-94']
me, i like to have to work to find someone attractive.:::['9-12-95']
makes me feel like i earned it.:::['9-12-96']
looks like joey's doing all right with her.:::['9-12-97']
yeah. hey, that was nice of you guys to back off......and let joey get the girl for once.:::['9-12-98']
i'm gonna take her to the apartment. okay, i'll be home right after work.:::['9-12-99']
okay. okay, bye, emma-wemma-demma.:::['9-12-100']
i lovey-wovey-dove you.:::['9-12-101']
molly: bye. monica: bye.:::['9-12-102']
they've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk.:::['9-12-103']
it's not so good.:::['9-12-104']
i think it's sweet.:::['9-12-105']
ross & chandler & joey: bye, emma-wemma!:::['9-12-106']
hey, listen, joey. about molly, i would really prefer if you didn't go after her.:::['9-12-107']
because it took months to find a good nanny.:::['9-12-109']
and i wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.:::['9-12-110']
so you think i'm just gonna sleep with her......and never call her again, and:::['9-12-111']
things are gonna get uncomfortable?:::['9-12-112']
come on, there are plenty of other women out there, okay?:::['9-12-114']
just forget about her, okay? she's off-limits.:::['9-12-115']
oh, man. what'd you have to go and say that for?:::['9-12-116']
now that you told me i can't have her, makes me want her even more!:::['9-12-117']
what are you, a child? yes.:::['9-12-118']
look, joey, come on now. for me, please.:::['9-12-119']
just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.:::['9-12-120']
take me home.:::['9-12-122']
hey, mikey. hey, pheeb.:::['9-12-123']
what are you doing? setting rattraps.:::['9-12-124']
to kill bob? no. no, to test his neck strength.:::['9-12-125']
but no, i don't want to kill him. i thought we were gonna capture him......and, you know,set him free in the countryside......where he could meet:::['9-12-126']
a friendly possum......and a wisecracking owl.:::['9-12-127']
okay, okay. i'll throw away the traps. all right, i'll find bob. i'll get him.:::['9-12-128']
bob? bob?:::['9-12-129']
robert?:::['9-12-130']
wait, i think i hear him.:::['9-12-131']
oh, my god! bob had babies! bob's a mom!:::['9-12-132']
we'll have to think of a new name.:::['9-12-133']
oh, i don't know, i kind of like "bob" for a girl.:::['9-12-134']
no, no. i mean, i'm not sure that we...:::['9-12-135']
oh, my god. we killed bob?:::['9-12-136']
well, maybe it wasn't bob. maybe it was a mouse.:::['9-12-137']
susie?:::['9-12-138', '2-13-238', '2-13-239']
seriously, dude. three years ago.:::['9-12-140']
listen, can you do me a favor? i'm gonna be out today.:::['9-12-141']
can you keep an eye on joey......make sure nothing happens:::['9-12-142']
between him and molly?:::['9-12-143']
you don't trust him? well, no.:::['9-12-144']
some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier......and asked for her daughter,uh, the "hot nanny.":::['9-12-145']
is this really your long-term plan, for me to run interference?:::['9-12-146']
because i could get a job any day now.:::['9-12-147']
you do appear right on the cusp of something.:::['9-12-148']
look, come on, man. i'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two......but for now, could you please:::['9-12-149']
just do this for me?:::['9-12-150']
fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work.:::['9-12-151']
because you know once joey sets his mind on something......more often than not,he's going to have sex with it.:::['9-12-152']
well, i mean, we've gotta do something. okay?:::['9-12-153']
nannies like her don't grow on trees.:::['9-12-154']
picturing that tree? i am, yes.:::['9-12-155']
where you going, joe?:::['9-12-156']
for a walk.:::['9-12-157']
oh, you mind if i join you?:::['9-12-158']
actually, uh, i'd rather be alone. you know, i really need to organize my thoughts.:::['9-12-159']
your thoughts?:::['9-12-160']
plural?:::['9-12-161']
all right, fine. i only have one thought.:::['9-12-162']
it's about the hot nanny. i gotta see her.:::['9-12-163']
i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe. now you're telling me i can't see her?:::['9-12-164']
you guys are killing me. she's forbidden fruit. it's like, like...:::['9-12-165']
like she's the princess and i'm the stable boy.:::['9-12-166']
why are you doing this, huh?:::['9-12-167']
did ross tell you not to let me go over there?:::['9-12-168']
yes, as a matter of fact, he did. so i can't let you go.:::['9-12-169']
huh. interesting. now there are obstacles.:::['9-12-170']
hot nanny and me against the world.:::['9-12-171']
this is the stuff great novels are made of.:::['9-12-172']
great novels? fine. mediocre porn.:::['9-12-173']
gavin mitchell's office. rachel green's office.:::['9-12-174']
give me that phone.:::['9-12-175']
hello, this is rachel green. how can i help you?:::['9-12-176']
uh-huh. okay, then. i'll pass you back to your son.:::['9-12-177']
hey, mom. no, that's just my secretary.:::['9-12-178']
um, excuse me, gavin. i have a question i need to ask you.:::['9-12-179']
mom, i'll call you later. yeah.:::['9-12-180']
yes? if you like looking at butts so much......why don't you just go:::['9-12-181']
look in a mirror?:::['9-12-182']
thank god you finally said that.:::['9-12-183']
i saw you make a note on your pad three hours ago.:::['9-12-184']
man, i really bug you. don't i? oh, no. please......i don't care about you:::['9-12-185']
enough to bug me.:::['9-12-186']
in fact, from now on, i'm going to take the high road......and i'm going to be very, very nice:::['9-12-187']
to you, you mama's boy......starting right now.:::['9-12-188']
hey, rach. rachel: hi.:::['9-12-189']
ready for your birthday lunch? i am.:::['9-12-190']
but first, monica, i would like to introduce you......to my very talented colleague:::['9-12-191']
and more importantly......my wonderful friend, gavin mitchell.:::['9-12-192']
pleased to meet you. pleased to meet you.:::['9-12-193']
are you coming to rachel's party?:::['9-12-194']
oh, no, no, no. gavin can't. he already has plans......most likely with his mother.:::['9-12-195']
i don't mind. i'll cancel them. i would never miss my secretary's birthday.:::['9-12-196']
why did you invite him? i can't stand that guy.:::['9-12-197']
you were being so nice to him. i was faking it.:::['9-12-198']
can't you tell when i'm being fake?:::['9-12-199']
hey, mr. phillips. nice suit.:::['9-12-200']
right there. that was so fake! shh!:::['9-12-201']
oh, hi.:::['9-12-202', '10-5-350', '10-7-313', '5-1-100']
i still can't believe you invited gavin.:::['9-12-203']
i mean, he is just the last person i want to see.:::['9-12-204']
you're welcome for the party. i'm glad you're having a good time.:::['9-12-205']
god, i hope he doesn't show up. of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.:::['9-12-206']
does he? what?:::['9-12-207']
maybe he keeps bothering you so much because he likes you.:::['9-12-208']
it's like in first grade when skippy lange would push me......because he secretly:::['9-12-209']
had a crush on me.:::['9-12-210']
oh, monica, you think skippy liked you?:::['9-12-211']
honey, all those boys had a bet to see if he could knock you over.:::['9-12-212']
she's out. i'm gonna take her home. oh, okay. thank you.:::['9-12-213']
bye, sweetheart.:::['9-12-214']
do you see what all the guys see in her?:::['9-12-215']
wouldn't kick her out of bed.:::['9-12-216']
no more vodka for me.:::['9-12-217']
hey, rach. so can i sing "happy birthday" to you now?:::['9-12-218']
yeah, sure. oh. all right.:::['9-12-219']
hey, rach. somebody got you shoes.:::['9-12-222']
give me.:::['9-12-223']
wow. wow. oh, my god! careful! careful!:::['9-12-224']
these are my rat babies!:::['9-12-225']
yeah. we have rat babies now.:::['9-12-226']
oh, you brought rats to my birthday party?:::['9-12-227']
so this is what a stroke feels like.:::['9-12-228']
well, i had to bring them. we killed their mother.:::['9-12-229']
they're our responsibility now.:::['9-12-230']
you know, they require constant care.:::['9-12-231']
you should know that, rachel, you're a mother.:::['9-12-232']
are you comparing my daughter to a rat?:::['9-12-233']
no. seven rats.:::['9-12-234']
i think we should take them home. we need to feed them.:::['9-12-235']
wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?:::['9-12-236']
well, i'm sorry, rachel, but i'm not like you. okay?:::['9-12-237']
not everyone can afford help.:::['9-12-238']
hey, where the hell are joey and molly?:::['9-12-239']
i asked you to watch them.:::['9-12-240']
i'm sorry. i got a little preoccupied.:::['9-12-241']
look, we have to stop them before something happens.:::['9-12-242']
right behind you, big guy.:::['9-12-243']
so you see, molly, what people don't understand......is that acting is a discipline.:::['9-12-244']
it takes a lot of hard work.:::['9-12-245']
so where'd you study? oh, i didn't go to college.:::['9-12-246']
no, where'd you study acting? molly, people don't study acting.:::['9-12-247']
molly, uh, do you mind giving us just a minute?:::['9-12-248']
sure. i'll go check on emma. ross: thanks.:::['9-12-249']
will the stable boy never get the princess?:::['9-12-250']
what do you think you were gonna do, have sex with her here on my couch?:::['9-12-251']
no. the leather sticks to my ass.:::['9-12-252']
this isn't fair. what makes you think i'm gonna sleep with her......and then blow her off, huh?:::['9-12-253']
can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actually like her......and might want something real?:::['9-12-254']
look, the truth is i haven't felt this way about anyone since rachel.:::['9-12-255']
okay? i didn't think i could ever love again.:::['9-12-256']
hi. is molly here?:::['9-12-258']
uh, yeah, yeah. come on in. molly?:::['9-12-259']
hey. guys, this is tabitha. tabitha: hey.:::['9-12-260']
uh, well, joey, i guess we have no problem.:::['9-12-262']
it's like my favorite fairy tale come true.:::['9-12-263']
the princess, the stable boy and the lesbian.:::['9-12-264']
okay. okay, you start preparing the formula......and i'll start changing the box.:::['9-12-265']
and then we gotta put them straight to bed.:::['9-12-266']
when did we become one of those couples......whose lives revolve around their rats?:::['9-12-267']
well, you know what? they're our responsibility now.:::['9-12-268']
okay, fine. these rats are our responsibility.:::['9-12-269']
what happens when they mate and there are hundreds?:::['9-12-270']
mate? they're all brothers and sisters.:::['9-12-271']
yeah, uh, not such a problem with rats.:::['9-12-272']
no, they're more of a "love the one you're with" kind of animal.:::['9-12-273']
no. really?:::['9-12-274']
oh, my... get off your sister! ew.:::['9-12-275']
oh, my god. what are we gonna do?:::['9-12-276']
the... we have seven rats. uh-huh.:::['9-12-277']
so, what if each of them has seven rats......and then each of those:::['9-12-278']
have seven rats? that's like...:::['9-12-279']
that's math i can't even do.:::['9-12-280']
well, i know this is gonna sound crazy......but we could:::['9-12-282']
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.:::['9-12-283']
yeah, okay. i guess you're right.:::['9-12-284']
all right, so we should just give them away.:::['9-12-285']
but to nice families with children and reduced-fat wheat thins.:::['9-12-286']
those were bob's favorites.:::['9-12-287']
you must think i'm crazy. no, i think you're sweet.:::['9-12-289']
this is just so hard.:::['9-12-291']
it's hard for me to let them go.:::['9-12-292']
i guess it just brings back memories, you know......from when i gave birth to my brother's:::['9-12-293']
triplets and i had to give them up.:::['9-12-294']
i haven't told you about that yet, have i?:::['9-12-295']
thanks for the party, honey. should i help you clean up?:::['9-12-297']
no way. you had your party. now i have mine.:::['9-12-298']
is everything all right? i just get bummed......when my birthday's over.:::['9-12-299']
well, at least you have one thing to be happy about.:::['9-12-300']
mm? that jerk, gavin, from your office......didn't show up.:::['9-12-301']
yeah, i hate him.:::['9-12-303']
we weren't talking about you. we were...:::['9-12-304']
no. no way to recover. no. okay.:::['9-12-305']
fun party. rachel: well, it was.:::['9-12-306']
and you would have seen it if you didn't show up at...:::['9-12-307']
nine-thirty? god. ugh, this party was lame.:::['9-12-308']
again, you're welcome.:::['9-12-309']
look, i'll just give you this and go. oh, you bought me a present. why?:::['9-12-310']
let me explain how birthday parties usually work. there are presents......and a cake,perhaps a fourth or fifth person.:::['9-12-311']
okay, i, uh...:::['9-12-312']
i got you the present to make up for being such a jerk to you.:::['9-12-313']
aw. well, okay. well, that's very nice. and you wrote a card.:::['9-12-314']
"from gavin." i really mean it.:::['9-12-315']
if you don't mind? let me. no.:::['9-12-318']
well, what do you know, it fits.:::['9-12-319']
see, gavin. you're capable of being a nice guy.:::['9-12-320']
why do you give me such a hard time?:::['9-12-321']
well, monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.:::['9-12-323']
i do have feelings for you.:::['9-12-324']
you do? yes. i feel that you're a little annoying.:::['9-12-325']
see, why? gavin, why?:::['9-12-326']
right when i'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you...:::['9-12-327']
and you do that.:::['9-12-328']
first i was afraid, i was petrified:::['9-12-329']
listen, um, i think i left something here.:::['9-12-331']
oh. uh, well, somebody left this. is this yours?:::['9-12-332']
oh. no, but i like it.:::['9-12-333']
no, i think i left one of my rat babies.:::['9-12-334']
oh. uh, well, no. i haven't seen it, but if i do, i'll let you know.:::['9-12-335']
aah! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby! rat baby!:::['9-12-336']
maybe that's him.:::['9-12-337', '5-4-17']
have you seen our bank statement? can this be right?:::['9-16-0']
i know. god, i haven't seen my savings take a hit like this......since i was a kid and they came up:::['9-16-1']
with double stuf oreos.:::['9-16-2']
what happened to all of our money? well, i'm not sure exactly what they did......but i'm inclined to blame enron.:::['9-16-3']
well, i guess with you doing the internship... ...we're just spending more than we're bringing in.:::['9-16-4']
yeah, maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.:::['9-16-5']
but you're finally doing something that you love.:::['9-16-6']
i mean, i can't ask you to give that up.:::['9-16-7']
although it would be nice if the thing that you loved was, you know, finding gold.:::['9-16-8']
you know what? i think we're making too big a deal out of this.:::['9-16-9']
okay? so we pay our bills late this month. maybe next month, we cut back on a few things.:::['9-16-10']
and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change.:::['9-16-11']
you're a chef. what can you make out of baking soda and beer?:::['9-16-12']
all right. worst-case scenario is, we borrow some money from my parents.:::['9-16-13']
no, we're not borrowing money.:::['9-16-14']
why not? because we don't do that. we are bings.:::['9-16-15']
if there's one thing my father taught me, it was......well, to always knock:::['9-16-16']
before going into the pool house.:::['9-16-17']
but the other thing was, never borrow money. wow, i had no idea you had this much pride.:::['9-16-18']
that's right, i do. i am your man. and i'm gonna get us through this situation......even if it means you working:::['9-16-19']
twice as hard.:::['9-16-20']
i'm gonna go. why?:::['9-16-21']
i haven't been home in a couple days and i need to get more clothes.:::['9-16-22']
you don't have to go. i have something that'll fit you.:::['9-16-23']
i put that tube top on as a joke.:::['9-16-24']
i want you to stay. i want to stay too.:::['9-16-25']
but i've got as much use out of these boxers as i can.:::['9-16-26']
why don't you turn them inside-- done it.:::['9-16-27']
i'll be back in a couple of hours. all right. i'll miss you.:::['9-16-28']
you know what? i just realized something. i don't want to go home.:::['9-16-30']
great! okay, i'll go get the tube top. no, no, what i mean is...:::['9-16-31']
...i hate going back to my apartment now. mm-hm.:::['9-16-32']
partly because i live above a known crack den......but, you know, mostly because:::['9-16-33']
when i'm there, i really miss you.:::['9-16-34']
so......do you want to move in together?:::['9-16-35']
wow, mike hannigan......you sure know how to:::['9-16-36']
make a girl say "hell, yeah.":::['9-16-37']
so we're doing it? yeah, let's do it. let's live together.:::['9-16-38']
wow. we're really gonna move in together?:::['9-16-39']
i've always wanted to live with a guy.:::['9-16-41']
pick up your socks. put down the toilet seat.:::['9-16-42']
no, we are not having sex anymore.:::['9-16-43']
it's gonna be fun.:::['9-16-44']
hey, joey- hey.:::['9-16-45']
listen, i need to know that what i'm about to ask you......will never get back to chandler.:::['9-16-46']
i'd be lying if i said i hadn't thought about it myself.:::['9-16-47']
but chandler is my best friend. it would be wrong.:::['9-16-48']
good, but wrong.:::['9-16-49']
okay, first of all, it would be great.:::['9-16-50']
but that's not what i'm here to talk to you about. i need to borrow money.:::['9-16-51']
oh, i don't know, monica. you know......lending friends money:::['9-16-52']
is always a mistake.:::['9-16-53']
but chandler lent you money. and he would tell you it was a mistake.:::['9-16-54']
come on, i just-- i need it for some rent and some other bills.:::['9-16-55']
oh, well... well, how much?:::['9-16-56']
two thousand dollars? two thousand dollars?:::['9-16-57']
what do you think i am, a soap-opera star?:::['9-16-58']
yeah. that's right, i am.:::['9-16-59']
hi, you guys. monica & joey: hey.:::['9-16-60']
what's in the bag? you know how emma started crawling?:::['9-16-61']
i realized that this place is very unsafe for a baby......so i went to the store and i got some:::['9-16-62']
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.:::['9-16-63']
oh, god, baby-proofing.:::['9-16-64']
why is it such a big deal now? you know, when i was a kid, it was like::::['9-16-65']
"whoops, joey fell down the stairs.":::['9-16-66']
or, "whoops, joey electrocuted himself again.":::['9-16-67']
anyway, um, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?:::['9-16-68']
no, i was just gonna do it myself. ha, ha.:::['9-16-69']
you're gonna do it'? yeah. why?:::['9-16-70']
you don't think a woman can do this? women can. you can't.:::['9-16-71']
monica, will you please tell joey that he is a pig.:::['9-16-72']
you're a pig. and you can't do this. what?:::['9-16-73']
what? come on, i found the hardware store all by myself.:::['9-16-74']
the hardware store's right down the street.:::['9-16-75']
there is a hardware store right down the street?:::['9-16-76']
hey, you guys? okay, we've got great news.:::['9-16-77']
phoebe and i are moving in together. congratulations.:::['9-16-78']
i know, it's so exciting. you know, i've never lived with a guy before.:::['9-16-79']
well, it's just like living with a girl, only they don't steal your makeup.:::['9-16-80']
unless they're playing "this ls what my sister would look like.":::['9-16-81']
yeah, she's not so cute.:::['9-16-82']
i'm gonna go to the bathroom. well, you put down the toilet seat.:::['9-16-83']
yes, dear.:::['9-16-84', '9-16-87']
is that a bit you guys do? uh-huh. we're playing you two.:::['9-16-85']
we don't do that. tell her we don't do that.:::['9-16-86']
i can't believe you're moving in together. that's gre-- i'm happy for you guys.:::['9-16-88']
i hear wedding bells. monica, slow down, okay?:::['9-16-89']
i'm just excited to be living with him.:::['9-16-90']
you know, i mean, i don't know......can i see someday being:::['9-16-91']
married to mike? sure. yeah.:::['9-16-92']
you know, i could picture myself walking down the aisle......in a wedding dress that highlights:::['9-16-93']
my breasts in an obvious yet classy way.:::['9-16-94']
but do i want that house in connecticut, you know, near the good schools......where mike and i could send:::['9-16-95']
little sophie and mike jr.?:::['9-16-96']
oh, my god, i do.:::['9-16-97']
phoebe, i had no idea you were so conventional. i know. i guess i am.:::['9-16-98']
oh, my god, load up the volvo, i want to be a soccer mom.:::['9-16-99']
you ready to go? yeah, you bet, roomie.:::['9-16-100']
don't you mean "groomie"?:::['9-16-101']
what are you talking about? please.:::['9-16-102']
these guys. we haven't even moved in yet... ...and they have us picking out china patterns.:::['9-16-103']
china patterns!:::['9-16-104']
this is easy. "can't do this...":::['9-16-105']
wow, seriously. can't do this.:::['9-16-106']
chandler: hey, joe. joey: hey.:::['9-16-107']
listen, um, i need to ask you a favor, and we can't tell monica anything about it.:::['9-16-108']
i thought you guys didn't have secrets. that will remain the official party line.:::['9-16-109']
look, monica and i are having a little financial trouble.:::['9-16-110']
yeah, i know. what? what do you mean, you "know"?:::['9-16-111']
i just figured it out, you know?:::['9-16-113']
i mean, you're not working and, uh, the economy is bad.:::['9-16-114']
that is the fastest i have ever thought.:::['9-16-116']
anyway, uh......i need to borrow some money.:::['9-16-117']
oh, sure. yeah, how much? two thousand dollars?:::['9-16-118']
yes, $2000 exactly. how did you know that?:::['9-16-119']
uh, well, i know how much you used to make... ...and i know how much your rent is.:::['9-16-120']
i am on fire.:::['9-16-122']
listen, this is really nice.:::['9-16-123']
did you write a check to monica for $2000?:::['9-16-124']
did monica borrow money from you?:::['9-16-125']
uh, kind of. i can't believe her.:::['9-16-126']
did she tell you we were having money problems?:::['9-16-127']
no, no, no. it wasn't because of your money problems.:::['9-16-128']
it was for something for her.:::['9-16-129']
something personal.:::['9-16-131']
what would she get for $2000 that she wouldn't tell me about?:::['9-16-132']
boob job.:::['9-16-134']
i don't want her to get a boob job. that's crazy.:::['9-16-135']
well, it's not that crazy, okay?:::['9-16-136']
making them smaller, that would be crazy.:::['9-16-137']
oh, hey, i wanted to ask you about monica's little "groomie" joke.:::['9-16-138']
well, i think the reason people laughed is that it's a play on the word "roomie.":::['9-16-139']
no...:::['9-16-140', '3-6-245']
i get the joke. sophisticated as it was.:::['9-16-141']
no, the thing i want to say is...:::['9-16-142']
maybe we should've talked about this before.:::['9-16-143']
us living together, you're not expecting a proposal, right?:::['9-16-144']
oh, no, no. not at all. okay.:::['9-16-145']
we're just moving in right now. we'll see where it goes.:::['9-16-146']
yeah, well, that's the thing. for me, it's as far as it can ever go.:::['9-16-147']
what do you mean? look, phoebe, i...:::['9-16-148']
i love you very much. but i never want to get married again.:::['9-16-149']
wow. it's just, my first marriage was......you know, such a disaster that:::['9-16-151']
i kind of lost faith in the whole idea.:::['9-16-152']
mm-hm. was it really that bad? at one point, near the end...:::['9-16-153']
...she deliberately defecated on my-- okay, well, that's bad. yeah.:::['9-16-154']
but don't you think it might be different with someone else? perhaps......a blond who always uses the toilet?:::['9-16-155']
except for once in the ocean.:::['9-16-156']
look, it's not about who i would marry.:::['9-16-157']
i was certain the first time i got married it would last forever. i was wrong.:::['9-16-158']
but, it just-- look, phoebe, it's not about you.:::['9-16-159']
i just never want to get married again.:::['9-16-160']
ah. i'm sorry.:::['9-16-161']
are you okay with that? if not, maybe us moving in together isn't the best idea.:::['9-16-162']
no. oh, i definitely don't want to get married.:::['9-16-163']
no, i just wanted to make sure you didn't want to, too.:::['9-16-164']
because, you know, if we move in and you start changing your mind......there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.:::['9-16-165']
trust me. i will never-- yeah, i get that. yeah.:::['9-16-166']
hi. so you gave in and decided to call someone?:::['9-16-167']
yeah. i don't know who i was kidding. i can barely use chopsticks.:::['9-16-168']
you're all set. oh, thank you so much.:::['9-16-169']
wait. you forgot your, um...:::['9-16-170']
your game.:::['9-16-171']
hey, rach. there she is, my perfectly proportioned wife.:::['9-16-173']
don't look at me. i never get his jokes.:::['9-16-174']
thank you? no, no. don't thank me.:::['9-16-175']
thank you. do you know there is not one thing that i would change about you?:::['9-16-176']
not one single thing. and definitely not......two single things.:::['9-16-177']
okay, you're being weird. do you want sex... ...or did you do something bad?:::['9-16-178']
no. no. no. i just love the way you look. i am warm......for your form.:::['9-16-179']
okay, um, you know the old classics like, you know, "you look nice"?:::['9-16-180']
they're still okay.:::['9-16-181']
but "you look nice" could mean that i'm saying, "your face looks nice.":::['9-16-182']
i want to compliment your body.:::['9-16-183']
i mean, i wouldn't change it at all.:::['9-16-184']
and more specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.:::['9-16-185']
okay. i mean......you wouldn't want any part of me:::['9-16-186']
to get any bigger, would you?:::['9-16-187']
don't answer that.:::['9-16-188', '4-21-127', '3-16-195']
just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.:::['9-16-189']
i know. why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?:::['9-16-190']
i don't know. i mean, what brought that on'?:::['9-16-191']
oh, my god. oh, my god. you know what? we're trying to get pregnant......so he's probably starting to freak out:::['9-16-192']
that my body's gonna change.:::['9-16-193']
you think that's what it is? you heard him.:::['9-16-194']
"no bigger. you're perfect. just don't get any bigger.":::['9-16-195']
my god, he sounded just like my high-school wrestling coach.:::['9-16-196']
i'm gonna have to talk to chandler. yeah. if you don't, i will.:::['9-16-197']
of course your body's gonna change. your breasts are gonna get bigger......your ass is gonna get bigger......you're gonna lose bladder control.:::['9-16-198']
god, it's just such a magical time.:::['9-16-199']
hi. hey. listen, i wanted to ask you something about marriage.:::['9-16-200']
now you're seeking me out to make jokes?:::['9-16-201']
i mean, i can see if we're all hanging out, but to come to my home...:::['9-16-202']
no, i really want to know how you feel about it.:::['9-16-203']
why? mike doesn't ever want to get married.:::['9-16-204']
never? never.:::['9-16-205']
wow. are you still gonna move in with him?:::['9-16-206']
i want to, but i wanted you to tell me that marriage really isn't that big a deal.:::['9-16-207']
you know, that i won't be missing out on anything. that marriage stinks.:::['9-16-208']
yeah, marriage stinks.:::['9-16-209']
i mean, if you want to see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving......get them married.:::['9-16-210']
that's not how you really feel, is it? no, i'm sorry.:::['9-16-211']
look, i know it's not what you want to hear, but i can't help it. i love marriage.:::['9-16-212']
seriously, you? divorce-0?:::['9-16-213']
if you have to call me a name, i'd prefer "ross, the divorcer." it's just cooler.:::['9-16-214']
look, look, i know my marriages didn't exactly work out......but, you know, i loved being:::['9-16-215']
that committed to another person.:::['9-16-216']
and carol and i had some good times before she became a lesbian.:::['9-16-217']
and once afterward.:::['9-16-218']
anyway, i'm sorry.:::['9-16-219']
ugh. it's okay. that's how you feel.:::['9-16-220']
but, come on, i mean, living together will be great.:::['9-16-221']
i mean, you guys have so much fun. and you love mike.:::['9-16-222']
i do love mike. yeah, see?:::['9-16-223']
and you were so excited about moving in together before......and you know what? you should be.:::['9-16-224']
it's a big deal.:::['9-16-225']
yeah, i guess you're right.:::['9-16-226', '4-1-257']
yeah, thanks. this helped. thanks.:::['9-16-227']
the divorcer to the rescue.:::['9-16-228']
it's not cooler. yeah, i just heard it.:::['9-16-229']
rash?:::['9-16-231']
so i can't do anything i like?:::['9-16-233']
ah, perfection. wouldn't change a thing. not a thing.:::['9-16-235']
honey? chandler: yeah?:::['9-16-236']
about that.:::['9-16-237']
um, i'm going to change. yes, but, honey, you don't have to.:::['9-16-238']
i'm gonna get bigger.:::['9-16-239']
honey, i...:::['9-16-240']
i love your breasts the way they are.:::['9-16-241']
ugh. fascist.:::['9-16-242']
well, my breasts are gonna get bigger whether you like it or not.:::['9-16-243']
and it's not just my breasts. my ass is gonna get bigger too.:::['9-16-244']
your ass?:::['9-16-245']
and don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too.:::['9-16-246']
they do that? it's kind of a package deal.:::['9-16-247']
god, why? why would you want to do that to yourself?:::['9-16-248']
i thought it was something that we both wanted.:::['9-16-249']
if it means that much to you, i may be able to get on board with the big boobs......but the giant ass:::['9-16-250']
and the big clown feet?:::['9-16-251']
oh, my god, chandler.:::['9-16-252']
if you can't handle this, what are you gonna be like in the hospital......with the blood and screaming and the:::['9-16-253']
little person that's shooting out of her?:::['9-16-254']
joey, why did you tell chandler that monica was getting a boob job?:::['9-16-256']
because she is.:::['9-16-257']
chandler knows i borrowed the money. mm-hm. for your boob job.:::['9-16-258']
joe... it's over.:::['9-16-259']
okay, so i'm out $4000 and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?:::['9-16-260']
hey. hey, what do you guys think about this: ross, the divorce force.:::['9-16-261']
better. yeah?:::['9-16-262']
very cool.:::['9-16-263']
hey, pheebs? you know, i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day...:::['9-16-264']
...and i hope i was a little helpful. oh, yeah, you were helpful.:::['9-16-265']
yeah. no, thank you. good. good.:::['9-16-266']
because the more i thought about it, the more i realized......i don't think marriage is necessarily:::['9-16-267']
the right path for you.:::['9-16-268']
i know the other day in the coffeehouse......you were all caught up:::['9-16-270']
in the whole soccer-mom thing......but is that really you? i mean, can you:::['9-16-271']
honestly picture yourself in a volvo?:::['9-16-272']
they are awfully boxy.:::['9-16-273']
i mean, i don't know, you'd be so bored with marriage. i mean, it's so normal.:::['9-16-274']
hey, can i help?:::['9-16-276']
well, we climbed up four flights of stairs, maneuvered a narrow hallway......dodged a rabid pit bull. but these last:::['9-16-277']
three feet are where it gets really tricky.:::['9-16-278']
you know, sometimes your words, they hurt.:::['9-16-279']
hey, where do you guys want this?:::['9-16-280']
yeah, seriously, because this is really heavy.:::['9-16-281']
i mean, not for me, because i'm only pretending to hold it, but for these guys.:::['9-16-282']
just one last time on the marriage thing. there's no wiggle room? none at all?:::['9-16-283']
no, but you don't want to get married either, right?:::['9-16-284']
except that i do want to get married.:::['9-16-286']
couldn't have had this conversation down at the truck, huh?:::['9-16-287']
what? you want to get married?:::['9-16-288']
someday.:::['9-16-289']
and hernia.:::['9-16-290']
i haven't had a normal life. and i never felt like i was missing out on anything.:::['9-16-291']
but it feels like now it's my turn to have some of the regular stuff.:::['9-16-292']
if you wanted to get married, why didn't you say something before?:::['9-16-293']
because i didn't know how much i wanted it. and i love you, and i wanted to live with you.:::['9-16-294']
i wanna live with you too. i mean, let's do that.:::['9-16-295']
but i don't think i can.:::['9-16-296']
it was okay to move in when i didn't know what was gonna happen.:::['9-16-297']
but i can't move in knowing nothing is ever gonna happen.:::['9-16-298']
can we at least try living together? you might change your mind about marriage.:::['9-16-299']
are you gonna change yours?:::['9-16-300']
um, i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want.:::['9-16-303']
but i don't want this to end.:::['9-16-304']
no, i don't want it to end either.:::['9-16-305']
i can't believe this is gonna end.:::['9-16-306']
i guess i'll have my stuff picked up.:::['9-16-307']
okay, so, uh...:::['9-16-309']
good bye.:::['9-16-310']
take it easy, mike. bye, mike. see you later, mike.:::['9-16-311']
i'm so sorry, pheebs.:::['9-16-312']
we're all sorry.:::['9-16-313']
look on the bright side. i mean, at least you won't have to live with this ugly chair.:::['9-16-314']
that was here already, huh?:::['9-16-315']
i did it! i did it! ha, ha!:::['9-16-317']
i'd better take all i can carry.:::['9-16-319']
who knows when i'll be able to get in here again, huh?:::['9-16-320']
you ready to go? let me just finish this.:::['9-17-0']
hey, ross. check this out.:::['9-17-1']
yeah, i can't do that. heh.:::['9-17-2']
what are you doing? have you seen this?:::['9-17-3']
it's our new alumni website for college.:::['9-17-4']
you can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.:::['9-17-5']
oh, great. a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless.:::['9-17-6']
it's actually interesting to find out what people are doing.:::['9-17-7']
remember andrea rich?:::['9-17-8']
tall girl, wouldn't sleep with you? uh-huh.:::['9-17-9']
well, her internet company went under, and she lost an ear in a boating accident.:::['9-17-10']
bet she'd sleep with you now.:::['9-17-11']
no, i already e-mailed her.:::['9-17-12']
let me see what you wrote about yourself.:::['9-17-13']
oh. "doctor of paleontology, two kids.":::['9-17-14']
wait a second. you split with carol because you had different interests?:::['9-17-15']
i think you split with carol because you had one very similar interest.:::['9-17-16']
you know what? i'm gonna finish this later, okay? let me just grab my coat.:::['9-17-17']
what, did you think you learned how to do it in the last two minutes?:::['9-17-19']
maybe we finish this for him.:::['9-17-20']
also, i cloned a dinosaur in my lab.:::['9-17-21']
she is now my girlfriend.:::['9-17-22']
i don't care what society says, it's the best sex i've ever had.:::['9-17-23']
and send. no, no-- you can't do that to him.:::['9-17-24']
all right, let's go. dude!:::['9-17-25']
uh, i think you made it clear you can't be trusted with the ball inside the house.:::['9-17-26']
and send.:::['9-17-27']
rachel: hey. how was basketball?:::['9-17-28']
it was fun. right up until chandler got a finger in the eye.:::['9-17-29']
oh, no. who did that?:::['9-17-30']
chandler. yeah.:::['9-17-31']
rash? rachel: yeah?:::['9-17-33']
what's huggsy doing in the crib with emma?:::['9-17-34']
she was just crawling around and she found him... ...so i just let her sleep with him.:::['9-17-35']
that's all right, isn't it? of course. yeah.:::['9-17-36']
it's a stuffed animal, you know? it's for kids. not for adults.:::['9-17-37']
i know that.:::['9-17-38']
joey, you're sure? i mean, i know how much you love him.:::['9-17-39']
rachel, let's be clear on this, okay? i do not love huggsy.:::['9-17-40']
i like him a normal amount.:::['9-17-41']
all right. well, emma loves him.:::['9-17-42']
yeah. well, why wouldn't she? he's a wonderful person.:::['9-17-43']
hi. hey, phoebe. how you doing?:::['9-17-44']
you feeling better? breaking up sucks.:::['9-17-45']
oh, i really miss mike. oh, i'm so sorry.:::['9-17-46']
i've tried everything to feel better. i even tried writing a song about it......but i can't think of anything:::['9-17-47']
that rhymes with::::['9-17-48']
hey, monica, i'm gonna need your help getting through this.:::['9-17-49']
you're saying you're not gonna need my help?:::['9-17-50']
no. when i get to the point where i'm ready......to hear cruel, mocking jokes:::['9-17-51']
about mike, i'm gonna come to you.:::['9-17-52']
oh, good, because i've already thought of three. four! i just thought of a fourth.:::['9-17-53']
okay. i mean, i know i did the right thing.:::['9-17-54']
mike never wants to get married......and i shouldn't be in a relationship:::['9-17-55']
that has no future.:::['9-17-56']
but pretty soon, i'm gonna miss him so much......i'm gonna want to see him again,and you have to stop me.:::['9-17-57']
okay, you got it.:::['9-17-58']
unless... am i being too crazy about this?:::['9-17-59']
all right, so, you know, there's no future. but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun.:::['9-17-60']
you know what? forget what i said. really?:::['9-17-61']
all right, if that's what you want. that was a test, and you just failed.:::['9-17-62']
damn it! rookie mistake.:::['9-17-63']
i have sex with dinosaurs?:::['9-17-64']
i believe i read that somewhere.:::['9-17-65']
not only is it not funny, it's physically impossible. okay?:::['9-17-66']
depending on the species, i'd have to have a 6-foot-long-- it's not funny!:::['9-17-67']
i respectfully disagree.:::['9-17-68']
i can't believe you put that on my alumni page.:::['9-17-69']
who cares? nobody reads those. you better hope not......because i just read what:::['9-17-70']
you put on your page.:::['9-17-71']
i don't have a page. oh, i respectfully disagree!:::['9-17-72']
joey: look at you. all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel.:::['9-17-73']
with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around you.:::['9-17-74']
it's okay, emma. you stay asleep.:::['9-17-75']
step away from the crib! i have a weapon!:::['9-17-76']
it's okay! it's okay, rach! it's me! put down the scrunchie.:::['9-17-77']
what are you doing? well, i heard emma stirring......so i came in to make sure:::['9-17-78']
she could reach huggsy.:::['9-17-79']
oh. oh, thanks. all right, well, now that i'm up, i'm gonna go to the bathroom.:::['9-17-80']
okay, there you go, sweetie.:::['9-17-81']
this isn't over.:::['9-17-82']
wait a second. why would ross tell everyone in your class......that you are:::['9-17-83']
"as gay as the day is long"?:::['9-17-84']
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.:::['9-17-85']
well, that's clearly a joke. this could easily be true.:::['9-17-86']
would you get that, please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.:::['9-17-87']
no, he's not here. yeah, this is his wife.:::['9-17-89']
yeah. well, it came as quite a shock to me too.:::['9-17-90']
well, i guess i should've known. yeah. he just kept making me watch moulin rouge.:::['9-17-91']
hang up- hang up-:::['9-17-92']
and that was a great movie.:::['9-17-93']
i'm so gonna get back at ross.:::['9-17-94']
oh, yeah, this'll show him. here we go.:::['9-17-95']
what are you doing? oh, you'll see, my friend!:::['9-17-96']
i'm dead?:::['9-17-97']
and so young.:::['9-17-98']
posting that i died? that really isn't funny.:::['9-17-99']
well, how you died was funny.:::['9-17-100']
oh, please. hit by a blimp?:::['9-17-101']
it kills over one americans every year.:::['9-17-102']
unbelievable. my classmates are gonna think i'm dead.:::['9-17-103']
my professors. my parents are gonna get phone calls.:::['9-17-104']
you're messing with people's feelings here.:::['9-17-105']
you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was......when i told him i wouldn't be able:::['9-17-106']
to go with him to key west!:::['9-17-107']
you've really crossed a line here. but that's okay.:::['9-17-108']
because i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software......and a stack of gay porn.:::['9-17-109']
that's right. your coming-out is about to get real graphic!:::['9-17-110']
god, i wish mike were here.:::['9-17-111']
okay, if mike were here, what would the two of you be doing?:::['9-17-112']
what are you, animals? it's 4:00 in the afternoon.:::['9-17-113']
i gotta call him. just to talk to him. there's no harm in that.:::['9-17-114']
phoebe, that's how it starts. "i don't need to eat the cake, i'll just smell the icing.:::['9-17-115']
why not just a little sliver?" or, "okay, just a slice or two.":::['9-17-116']
you know, the next thing you know, you're 210 pounds......and you get wedged in going:::['9-17-117']
down the tunnel slide.:::['9-17-118']
phoebe, honey, i know this is hard.:::['9-17-119']
but look, if you talk to him, then you're gonna want to see him.:::['9-17-120']
and if you see him, you're gonna wanna get back together.:::['9-17-121']
and i know that's not what you want.:::['9-17-122']
all right, so give me your phone.:::['9-17-123']
and now your cell. okay.:::['9-17-125']
this is your cell phone? yes.:::['9-17-127']
this is your current cell phone?:::['9-17-128']
yes. it reminds me of a simpler time.:::['9-17-129']
phoebe? where's your purse?:::['9-17-130']
“hey! no! no!:::['9-17-131']
give it to me! you can't have it.:::['9-17-132']
give it to me! no.:::['9-17-133']
i'll go in there. oh, yeah.:::['9-17-134']
monica: come here! no!:::['9-17-135']
monica: give it to me! you're crazy! god.:::['9-17-136']
aha!:::['9-17-137', '9-17-157']
damn you, monica geller hyphen bing!:::['9-17-138']
hey, look who's here. it's joey. and he brought home a friend.:::['9-17-139']
joey, emma's right here. you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.:::['9-17-140']
no, no, no, it's not a girl. it's...:::['9-17-141']
...a brand-new huggsy! oh.:::['9-17-142']
oh, that's so great. now emma has two huggsies.:::['9-17-143']
no, no. oh, no. no, emma has one huggsy.:::['9-17-144']
the new huggsy. huh?:::['9-17-145']
the other huggsy, i don't know, i guess i'll just take him back.:::['9-17-146']
you know what? when i was a little girl, i had a little pink pony named cotton.:::['9-17-147']
oh, i loved her so much. i took her everywhere. i would braid her tail--:::['9-17-148']
make the transfer!:::['9-17-149']
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old huggsy and i can't find it?:::['9-17-150']
don't worry about it. i swallowed that years ago. hey.:::['9-17-151']
oh, what? i don't think she likes the new huggsy.:::['9-17-152']
but he's the same. i think she wants the old one back.:::['9-17-153']
yeah, but he's the same. joey, come on.:::['9-17-154']
but he's the same.:::['9-17-155']
you're not the same.:::['9-17-156']
you know, it's a lot less surprising to do that......after i've buzzed you into the building.:::['9-17-158']
so, phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door?:::['9-17-159']
those are my shoes. oh.:::['9-17-160']
well, when you get over this breakup, we need to go shopping.:::['9-17-161']
look, monica, i really appreciate you checking in on me.:::['9-17-162']
but i'm actually feeling a lot better. you are?:::['9-17-163']
yeah, i just kind of want to be alone right now.:::['9-17-164']
who's that? phoebe: i ordered chinese food.:::['9-17-165']
what are the chances?:::['9-17-166', '9-14-320']
one billion chinese people, and they send mike!:::['9-17-167']
what are you doing here? phoebe called me.:::['9-17-168']
phoebe! i'm sorry. i broke down.:::['9-17-169']
i wanted to see him.:::['9-17-170']
damn it, phoebe, how did you even call him?:::['9-17-171']
there's a speakerphone on the base unit.:::['9-17-172']
base unit. think, monica, think!:::['9-17-173']
look, if i want to see phoebe, and she-- this doesn't concern you.:::['9-17-174']
sorry. i guess i was thrown off by the mention of my name.:::['9-17-175']
look, guys, you can't do this.:::['9-17-176']
it's gonna make getting over each other harder.:::['9-17-177']
not if nothing happens. why can't we just hang out as friends?:::['9-17-178']
sure. if you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe i'll join you.:::['9-17-179']
i'm your friend and mike's friend.:::['9-17-180']
phoebe: sit down.:::['9-17-182']
oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. make room for your friend.:::['9-17-183']
so how have you been? i've been pretty good.:::['9-17-184']
you look really beautiful. thanks. you look good too.:::['9-17-185']
no, no, no. this is dangerous territory. keep it clean.:::['9-17-186']
so how's the piano playing going?:::['9-17-187']
actually, i've been playing a lot of love songs lately.:::['9-17-188']
i've missed you. i've missed you too.:::['9-17-189']
you know, on the way over here, i saw this drunk guy throw up.:::['9-17-190']
and then a pigeon ate it.:::['9-17-191']
hey. ross.:::['9-17-192']
look, i just wanted to apologize.:::['9-17-193']
don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me.:::['9-17-194']
uh-huh, uh-huh. check this out.:::['9-17-195']
so that's what i'd look like if i worked out.:::['9-17-196']
and was being serviced by a policeman.:::['9-17-197']
you're not gonna actually send these out, are you?:::['9-17-198']
actually, i don't need to, because your little "ross is dead" joke didn't work.:::['9-17-199']
okay? there were no responses.:::['9-17-200']
nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents... ...so the joke, my friend, is on you.:::['9-17-201']
nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that i'm dead.:::['9-17-202']
nobody cares that i'm dead? oh, come on, you know that's not true.:::['9-17-204']
what are you talking about? you get 60 responses......just for coming out of the closet.:::['9-17-205']
i didn't get one response, and i'm dead!:::['9-17-206']
well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.:::['9-17-207']
i can't believe this. not even my geology lab partner. and i carried that guy.:::['9-17-208']
all right. look, let's think about this, okay?:::['9-17-209']
you think people are gonna disturb your family at this tragic time?:::['9-17-210']
that people are gonna post condolences on a website?:::['9-17-211']
this isn't about people not caring that you're dead.:::['9-17-212']
this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.:::['9-17-213']
you're right. there isn't a decent outlet. right.:::['9-17-214']
come on. i'm sure if you had a funeral or memorial service... ...tons of people would come.:::['9-17-215']
you're having a memorial service for yourself?:::['9-17-218']
no, that would be stupid. you're having it for me.:::['9-17-219']
ross, don't press send. don't press-- no, too late. too late. it's sent.:::['9-17-220']
sorry, so is that picture of you and the policeman.:::['9-17-221']
i'm trying to put emma down for a nap. have you seen huggsy?:::['9-17-222']
uh, original or crappy?:::['9-17-223']
original. no. sorry. haven't seen him.:::['9-17-224']
then what's that big lump under your covers'?:::['9-17-225']
it's monica, okay? that's not monica!:::['9-17-226']
all right, fine! it's original huggsy!:::['9-17-227']
i know emma wants him, but he's mine and i need him.:::['9-17-228']
she's being unreasonable.:::['9-17-229']
joey, there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much!:::['9-17-230']
oh, don't cover its ears!:::['9-17-231']
it's because it reminds her of her uncle joey.:::['9-17-232']
it does? yeah.:::['9-17-233']
and she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much.:::['9-17-234']
really? she loves me? oh, yeah.:::['9-17-235']
but you know what? if you need huggsy, don't worry.:::['9-17-236']
emma will totally understand. i won't, but whatever.:::['9-17-237']
okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, rach. i mean, if...:::['9-17-238']
if huggsy means that much to emma, then...:::['9-17-239']
well, she can have him.:::['9-17-240']
oh, sweet, i knew uncle joey would step up.:::['9-17-241']
look, emma. look who's back. no, forget it! forget it! i can't do it!:::['9-17-242']
are you--? you're gonna take huggsy away from a little child?:::['9-17-243']
how do you think i got him in the first place?:::['9-17-244']
all right, you two. i'm gonna go to the bathroom.:::['9-17-245']
i don't want anything going on while i'm gone.:::['9-17-246']
here's a few things you can discuss::::['9-17-247']
mucus, fungus, and the idea of me and ross doing it.:::['9-17-248']
i've missed you so much.:::['9-17-249']
i'm not gonna ask you to get back together. i know we want different things, but...:::['9-17-250']
just to be with you one more night. i want that too.:::['9-17-251']
but is that gonna make it too hard? it can't be any harder than this.:::['9-17-252']
i mean, if i had known the last time i saw you would be the last time, i--:::['9-17-253']
i would have stopped to memorize your face, the way you moved.:::['9-17-254']
everything about you.:::['9-17-255']
if i had known the last time i kissed you would be the last time......i never would have stopped.:::['9-17-256']
kiss him, you fool!:::['9-17-257']
what? didn't you hear that speech?:::['9-17-258']
if you don't kiss him, then i will.:::['9-17-259']
i knew you'd be here! aw, crap.:::['9-17-261']
who is this? it's my friend manny.:::['9-17-262']
i asked him to keep me away from you.:::['9-17-263']
hey, that's what i'm doing for phoebe. well, you're not doing a very good job.:::['9-17-264']
excuse me? what's with the kissing?:::['9-17-265']
hey, at least i knew where my guy was.:::['9-17-266']
yeah, thank god you were here to oversee all the kissing.:::['9-17-267']
you didn't hear the speech. manny: i've heard the speech.:::['9-17-268']
if he knew it was gonna be the last time--:::['9-17-269']
hey, it was very moving. you're just heartless!:::['9-17-270']
you're weak! you're weird!:::['9-17-271']
your pants are undone. oh!:::['9-17-272']
where'd they go?:::['9-17-273']
damn it. well, we blew it.:::['9-17-274']
i blame myself.:::['9-17-275']
and i blame you too.:::['9-17-276']
it's been an hour, and not one of my classmates has shown up?:::['9-17-277']
i tell you, when i actually die, some people are gonna get seriously haunted.:::['9-17-278']
there you go. someone came.:::['9-17-279']
okay. okay. i'm gonna go hide.:::['9-17-280']
this is so exciting. my first mourner!:::['9-17-281']
hi. glad you could come.:::['9-17-282']
please come in. hi. you're chandler bing, right?:::['9-17-283']
i'm tom gordon. i was in your class. oh, yes. yes, let me take your coat.:::['9-17-284']
thanks. uh, i'm so sorry about ross, it's...:::['9-17-285']
no, at least he died doing what he loved.:::['9-17-286']
watching blimps.:::['9-17-287']
who is it? you know some guy, tom gordon?:::['9-17-288']
i don't remember him.:::['9-17-289']
but then again, i touched so many lives.:::['9-17-290']
so did you know ross well?:::['9-17-291']
actually, i barely knew him. i came because i heard chandler's news.:::['9-17-292']
do you know if he's seeing anyone?:::['9-17-293']
yes, he is. me. what? you mean--? oh.:::['9-17-294']
can i ask you a personal question? how do you shave your beard so close'?:::['9-17-295']
okay, tommy! that's enough mourning for you.:::['9-17-296']
here we go. bye-bye. all right.:::['9-17-297']
hey, listen. call me. okay.:::['9-17-298']
i'm dead and no one cares? i look like a man?:::['9-17-299']
please, one ridiculous problem at a time.:::['9-17-300']
this isn't ridiculous. look around, no one's here.:::['9-17-301']
you gave them one day's notice. not everyone checks the website every day.:::['9-17-302']
and monica, it's probably the way you stand!:::['9-17-303']
i guess you're right. still, somebody must have seen it.:::['9-17-304']
i mean, i went to that school for four years and i didn't have an impact on anyone?:::['9-17-305']
well, that's not true. you had an impact on me.:::['9-17-306']
i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends.:::['9-17-307']
doesn't that count for something?:::['9-17-308']
oh, great, more party boys for chandler.:::['9-17-309']
i'm sure it's somebody for you. now go hide.:::['9-17-310']
hi. i'm here for ross geller's memorial service.:::['9-17-311']
kori? kori weston? yeah.:::['9-17-312']
you look amazing. and you are?:::['9-17-313']
chandler. chandler bing. and i'm not gay. i'm not gay at all.:::['9-17-314']
you are married, though.:::['9-17-315']
don't listen to him. he's in a really bad mood.:::['9-17-316']
i can't believe that ross is gone. it is just so sad.:::['9-17-317']
i didn't know ross and you were so close.:::['9-17-318']
oh, we weren't. but we had one class together. he was such a great guy.:::['9-17-319']
and he talked so passionately about science.:::['9-17-320']
i always remembered him. i'm sure that would mean a lot to him.:::['9-17-321']
and if heaven has a door......i'm sure he's pressing his ear:::['9-17-322']
up against it and listening intently.:::['9-17-323']
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.:::['9-17-324']
i guess i really missed my chance.:::['9-17-325']
no, you didn't!:::['9-17-326', '5-13-84']
i'm still alive!:::['9-17-327']
kori, i know this is a big surprise for you.:::['9-17-328']
it's a long story. but the things you just said really made my day.:::['9-17-329']
the fact that you're here means more to me......than if this room were filled:::['9-17-330']
with people.:::['9-17-331']
you sick freak! who does that?:::['9-17-332']
i can't believe i had a crush on you.:::['9-17-333']
kori weston had a crush on me!:::['9-17-335']
no, mom, i am not dead.:::['9-17-336']
i know it's not something to kid about.:::['9-17-337']
it was just a practical joke between chandler and me, but it's over, okay?:::['9-17-338']
actually, no. even if i had died, you would not be left childless.:::['9-17-339']
guys! guys! i've got great news. guess what.:::['9-15-0']
uh, monica's pregnant! really?:::['9-15-1']
let's get past the moment.:::['9-15-2']
what's your news? thank you.:::['9-15-3']
i got a job in advertising.:::['9-15-4']
oh, honey, that's incredible! phoebe: wow.:::['9-15-5']
gosh, what's the pay like?:::['9-15-6']
oh, come on, people.:::['9-15-7']
if i don't know who makes the most......how do i know who:::['9-15-8']
i like the most? hi, joey.:::['9-15-9']
it pays nothing. it's an internship.:::['9-15-10']
we have interns at days of our lives.:::['9-15-11']
right. so it'll be the same, except less sex with you.:::['9-15-12']
so, uh, what do you think they'll have you do there?:::['9-15-13']
it's a training program, but they hire the people they like.:::['9-15-14']
that's great! there's gonna be some grunt work......which will stink. a grown man:::['9-15-15']
getting people coffee is humiliating.:::['9-15-16']
humiliating and noble.:::['9-15-17']
you know, if i didn't already have a job......i would've been good in advertising.:::['9-15-19']
ross, you did not come up with "got milk?":::['9-15-20']
yes, i did! i did!:::['9-15-21']
i should've written it down.:::['9-15-22']
joey: hey. hey.:::['9-15-23', '7-16-266']
where's chandler? i wanna wish him good luck on his first day.:::['9-15-24']
and i smelled bacon. ha, ha.:::['9-15-25']
he just left. who did?:::['9-15-26']
joey, you're never gonna believe it! she called!:::['9-15-27']
she did'? rachel: you got it!:::['9-15-28']
i did? what is she talking about?:::['9-15-29']
i don't know, but it sounds great!:::['9-15-30']
no, your agent called. you got that audition!:::['9-15-31']
with leonard hayes? rachel: yes!:::['9-15-32']
oh, my god, that is great! it's for a play on broadway.:::['9-15-33']
and in a real theater. not that little one underneath the deli like last time.:::['9-15-34']
is it a good play'? it must be.:::['9-15-35']
i read it and didn't understand a single word!:::['9-15-36']
leonard hayes is starring in it. yeah, and directing.:::['9-15-37']
oh, he was so good in that movie of macbeth.:::['9-15-38']
you saw that? no, but i saw the previews.:::['9-15-39']
they played it right before jackass. ah. oh, yeah, yeah. he has.:::['9-15-40']
he's done some amazing work. oh, yeah.:::['9-15-41']
oh, i loved him in those phone commercials.:::['9-15-42']
when the monkey hits him in the face with the giant rubber phone. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-15-43']
maybe the monkey will be at the audition.:::['9-15-44']
don't make me more nervous than i already am!:::['9-15-45']
good morning. can i get you a cup of coffee, sir?:::['9-15-46']
oh, no, no. i'm an intern, just like you guys.:::['9-15-47']
except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that i can rent a car.:::['9-15-48']
seriously, you're an intern?:::['9-15-49']
i'm heading in a new career direction and you gotta start at the bottom.:::['9-15-50']
i know i'm a little older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope.:::['9-15-52']
the comedian. uso.:::['9-15-53']
uh, it's u.s.a., sir.:::['9-15-54']
this is joey tribbiani. joey, these are the producers.:::['9-15-55']
and as you probably already know, this is leonard hayes.:::['9-15-56']
it is so amazing to meet you. i am such a big fan of your work.:::['9-15-58']
well, i've been blessed with a lot of great roles.:::['9-15-59']
tell me about it, huh? "unlimited nights and weekends!":::['9-15-60']
are you making fun of me? because i am not a sellout.:::['9-15-61']
i didn't do it for money. i believe in those phones!:::['9-15-62']
i almost lost a cousin because of bad wireless service.:::['9-15-63']
no, i wasn't making fun of you. i think you were great in those commercials.:::['9-15-64']
well, i do bring a certain credibility to the role.:::['9-15-66']
it's true. are you kidding? when they shoot you out of that cannon--:::['9-15-67']
"hang up that phone!":::['9-15-68']
one take. wow. did that in one. i know.:::['9-15-69']
so shall we read? oh, yeah, sure.:::['9-15-70']
top of act 2. this is my entrance. you got it?:::['9-15-71']
what the hell are you still doing here?:::['9-15-73']
oh. uh.:::['9-15-74']
i think you know. bastard!:::['9-15-75']
i am what you made me. you know what? i could go right now.:::['9-15-76']
go! go! i can't.:::['9-15-77']
oh, i want to, long pause......but i can't.:::['9-15-78']
i'm so sorry. you're not supposed to say "long pause.":::['9-15-79']
oh! oh, i thought that was your character's name. you know?:::['9-15-80']
i thought you were, like, an indian or something, you know, with the...:::['9-15-81']
sorry. long pause. no. thank you so much for coming in. we appreciate it. thank you.:::['9-15-82']
sure you don't want me to do it again?:::['9-15-83']
i could do it with an accent. no.:::['9-15-84']
you know, southern. "i could go right now, mon!":::['9-15-85']
my god in heaven.:::['9-15-87']
joey, hang on for a second. leonard, can we talk to you for a moment?:::['9-15-88']
you've gotta be kidding. see, he can't act.:::['9-15-90']
i don't care if you think he's hot.:::['9-15-91']
if you wanna sleep with him, do it on your own time. this is a play.:::['9-15-92']
no, listen, if you insist on this......i will call my agent so fast......on a cell phone connection so clear,he's gonna think i'm next door!:::['9-15-93']
uh, hi. uh, thank you so much for whispering for my benefit.:::['9-15-94']
if you tell me what i did wrong, i would love to work on it and try it again for you.:::['9-15-95']
and also, how you doing?:::['9-15-96']
would you please just give me another chance? i really wanna get better. please? really?:::['9-15-97']
well, if you wanna come back today...:::['9-15-98']
...here are my notes. ready? yeah.:::['9-15-99']
um, you're in your head. you're thinking way too much. i really doubt that.:::['9-15-100']
no, no, no. it's that you're not connected with anything in your body.:::['9-15-101']
no urgency. the scene is a struggle. uh-huh.:::['9-15-102']
it's a race. uh-huh. also, what you did was horizontal.:::['9-15-103']
don't be afraid to explore the vertical. uh-huh.:::['9-15-104']
and don't learn the words. let the words learn you.:::['9-15-105']
couldn't i just sleep with the producer?:::['9-15-106']
hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?:::['9-15-107']
oh, i can't. i've got a date with that waitress, katie.:::['9-15-108']
yeah, i know we've only gone out, like, twice, but i don't know...:::['9-15-109']
...i have a good feeling about her. oh, i hear divorce bells.:::['9-15-110']
give me your wallets, and there won't be a problem.:::['9-15-111']
what? i have a gun.:::['9-15-112']
okay, just relax, phoebe. just stay calm.:::['9-15-113']
oh, my god, i can't find my wallet!:::['9-15-114']
all right, lady, now give me your purse. no.:::['9-15-115']
what do you mean, "no"? i knew you'd be my death, phoebe buffay!:::['9-15-116']
lowell, is that you? phoebe?:::['9-15-117']
oh, my god! unbelievable! oh, my god! oh!:::['9-15-118']
i'm sorry. ross, this is my old friend, lowell, from the streets! ha, ha.:::['9-15-119']
lowell, ross. ross, nice to meet you.:::['9-15-120']
yeah, a real pleasure.:::['9-15-121']
oh, it's been so long! oh, so long. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-15-122']
i can't believe you're still doing this. ah, i know. but i quit smoking.:::['9-15-123']
you look like you're doing well.:::['9-15-125']
i guess your mugging days are behind you.:::['9-15-126']
oh, my god. phoebe, you used to mug people?:::['9-15-128']
excuse me, ross, old friends catching up.:::['9-15-129']
how'd the audition go? they wanna see me again, but, uh......boy, leonard hayes did not like me.:::['9-15-131']
what happened? oh, he said i wasn't urgent enough.:::['9-15-132']
everything i did was horizontal, and i should be more vertical.:::['9-15-133']
oh, and he said that i should think less. well, so far so good.:::['9-15-134']
honey, i'm old!:::['9-15-135']
what's wrong?:::['9-15-136', '10-1-138', '2-11-250', '3-21-260']
i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them.:::['9-15-137']
so you're a little older.:::['9-15-138']
look at the positive. you have all this life experience.:::['9-15-139']
yes, but i don't think life experience is gonna help me with these.:::['9-15-140']
wow! it's like they're on fire!:::['9-15-141']
what are they? prototype sneakers.:::['9-15-143']
i need ideas on how to sell them. which i can't do......because no self-respecting adult:::['9-15-144']
would ever wear these.:::['9-15-145']
i'll give you $500 for them.:::['9-15-146']
what am i supposed to do? come on, sneakers are easy.:::['9-15-147']
you wear them all the time. they're not called sneakers anymore.:::['9-15-148']
they're called "kicks" or "skids." i think i heard somebody say "slorps.":::['9-15-149']
they've got wheels that pop out from the bottom so you can roll around......because apparently:::['9-15-150']
walking is too much exercise.:::['9-15-151']
"kids! kids! roll your way to childhood obesity!":::['9-15-152']
would you help me try to sell these?:::['9-15-153']
okay. have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?:::['9-15-154']
that's not what they're looking for.:::['9-15-155']
hey, that would work on me.:::['9-15-156']
why do you think i buy mrs. butten/vorth's?:::['9-15-157']
monica: hey. you'll never guess what just happened.:::['9-15-159']
phoebe and i got mugged! are you okay?:::['9-15-160']
yeah, because phoebe knew the mugger.:::['9-15-161']
how do you know a mugger?:::['9-15-162']
i'm sorry, i have friends outside the six of us.:::['9-15-163']
know how she knew him? because phoebe used to mug people.:::['9-15-164']
well, i'm not proud of it, but, you know......when i was living on the street and:::['9-15-166']
i needed money for food and stuff...:::['9-15-167']
that is awful. i wasn't rich like you guys, okay?:::['9-15-168']
i didn't eat gold and have a flying pony.:::['9-15-169']
i had a hard life. my mother was killed by a drug dealer.:::['9-15-170']
your mother killed herself. she was a drug dealer.:::['9-15-171']
it was a good thing phoebe knew him. i was about to do some serious damage.:::['9-15-172']
this must have brought back some bad memories for you, ross.:::['9-15-174']
why? well, ross was mugged as a kid.:::['9-15-175']
you were? yeah. and it was pretty traumatic.:::['9-15-176']
it was outside st. mark's comics.:::['9-15-177']
i was minding my business, seeing what kind of trouble spider-man got into.:::['9-15-178']
ahem, wonder woman. ahem.:::['9-15-179']
anyway, i was heading towards this bakery......to pick up a couple of dozen:::['9-15-180']
linzer tortes for someone......when out of nowhere, this thug:::['9-15-181']
with a pipe jumps out and says::::['9-15-182']
"give me your money, punk!" oh, my god.:::['9-15-183']
i know. and the worst part was they took my backpack......which had all the original artwork i had:::['9-15-184']
done for my own comic book, science boy.:::['9-15-185']
oh, yeah! what was his superpower again?:::['9-15-186']
a superhuman thirst for knowledge.:::['9-15-187']
i better get to class.:::['9-15-188']
are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way?:::['9-15-189']
no. actually, you might wanna stay away from jane street.:::['9-15-190']
that's where stabby joe works.:::['9-15-191']
okay, i think we have a problem here. what?:::['9-15-192']
well, um, back in my mugging days, i, um, worked st. mark's comics.:::['9-15-193']
yeah? well, a pipe was my weapon of choice......and, um, preteen comic-book nerds:::['9-15-194']
were my meat.:::['9-15-195']
there was one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said::::['9-15-197']
both: "geology rocks!":::['9-15-198']
oh, my god! i know! i mugged ross!:::['9-15-199']
you're late. i know. i'm sorry.:::['9-15-200']
but can i just run to the bathroom?:::['9-15-201']
no. leonard doesn't wait. but i am bursting with yoo-hoo!:::['9-15-202']
joey, here we go! let's go. very quickly.:::['9-15-203']
i really need-- we must go now, quickly.:::['9-15-204']
yeah. yes, sir. ahh. leonard: ready?:::['9-15-205']
what the hell are you still doing here? i think you know!:::['9-15-206']
oh, you sick bastard! i am what you made me! know what?:::['9-15-207']
what? i could go right now.:::['9-15-208']
then go. go! oh, i can't. i want to, but i can't!:::['9-15-209']
cut. that was good!:::['9-15-210']
very good. you did everything i asked. i did?:::['9-15-211']
yes. plus which, you've got this, i don't know, this squirmy quality......you bring to the character:::['9-15-212']
i couldn't have imagined.:::['9-15-213']
wow, hey, here's what we're gonna do::::['9-15-214']
come back tomorrow for the final callbacks.:::['9-15-215']
do all of this, what you got going now. but you know what?:::['9-15-216']
more. more. can you do that?:::['9-15-217']
sure. i don't have time to say thank you because i really gotta go!:::['9-15-218']
look at that! still in character. i like him.:::['9-15-219']
i plant seeds. i can't explain it. i don't know.:::['9-15-220']
hey. what are you doing? hey. putting on the sneakers......to get in the young mindset,see if it sparks anything.:::['9-15-221']
oh, anything yet? yes, how's this?:::['9-15-222']
"they're so uncomfortable, it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet.":::['9-15-223']
hey. chandler & monica: hey.:::['9-15-224', '5-16-0']
you're probably wondering what i'm doing. ha, ha.:::['9-15-225']
no, that seems about right.:::['9-15-226']
yesterday at my audition, i had to pee. apparently, that makes me a good actor.:::['9-15-227']
i got a callback, so i'm drinking everything. oh, by the way...:::['9-15-228']
rachel: mm-hm. ...that eggnog in our fridge was great!:::['9-15-229']
joey, that was formula. we gotta get more of that.:::['9-15-230']
these aren't half bad. you should suggest these to ralph lauren.:::['9-15-231']
okay, first of all, that's stupid. second, i'm not allowed to talk to ralph.:::['9-15-232']
all right. i feel younger already.:::['9-15-233']
yeah, i think i broke my hip.:::['9-15-234']
phoebe: hey, you! hey.:::['9-15-235']
hey. how was class?:::['9-15-236']
no one ever asks me that. what's wrong?:::['9-15-237']
nothing. i really wanna know. oh, uh.:::['9-15-238']
well, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene--:::['9-15-239']
all right, nothing is worth this.:::['9-15-240']
um, i have a confession to make. um...:::['9-15-241']
okay, you know that, um, girl that mugged you when you were a kid?:::['9-15-242']
what are you talking about? it wasn't a girl. it was this huge dude.:::['9-15-243']
you don't have to lie anymore. i know that it was a 14-year-old girl.:::['9-15-244']
no, it wasn't. yes, it was.:::['9-15-245']
no, it wasn't. you don't think i would have defended myself against a 14-year-old--?:::['9-15-246']
"give me your money, punk!" oh, my god, it was you!:::['9-15-247']
i can't believe it. you mugged me?:::['9-15-248']
yeah. and i'm so, so sorry, ross. i'm sorry.:::['9-15-249']
but, you know, if you think about it, it's kind of neat.:::['9-15-250']
i mean, well, it's just that i've always felt kind of like an outsider.:::['9-15-251']
you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back......and, you know, now you and i:::['9-15-252']
have a great one.:::['9-15-253']
it's not the best!:::['9-15-254']
i know. please forgive me. i don't know what to say.:::['9-15-255']
there's nothing you can say! that was the most humiliating thing ever.:::['9-15-256']
really? even more humiliating than-- let's not do this!:::['9-15-257']
and then, at the end of the commercial, the girls get out of the hot tub......and start making out:::['9-15-258']
with each other. huh? huh? huh?:::['9-15-259']
that's interesting.:::['9-15-260', '5-16-178']
just one thought: you didn't mention the shoes.:::['9-15-261']
who's next? chandler. chandler: okay.:::['9-15-262']
you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes.:::['9-15-263']
he's about my age. pfft! your age?:::['9-15-264']
so he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control.:::['9-15-266']
maybe he falls. maybe he hurts himself.:::['9-15-267']
just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes.:::['9-15-268']
he jumps over the old guy and laughs. and the line reads::::['9-15-269']
"not suitable for adults.":::['9-15-270']
well, chandler, that's great. oh, thank you, sir.:::['9-15-271']
or, man who's two years younger than me.:::['9-15-272']
you see, that has a clear selling point. it appeals to our key demographic.:::['9-15-273']
how did you come up with that? i don't know! i don't know!:::['9-15-274']
i was just trying to get into a young mindset, and stuff started to flow.:::['9-15-275']
that is great. good work. thank you.:::['9-15-276']
we'll see all of you tomorrow.:::['9-15-277']
the cold weather hurts my hip.:::['9-15-278']
hey, ross. i know you're still mad at me, but can i just talk to you for a sec?:::['9-15-279']
sure, go ahead. oh, sorry. sure, go ahead.:::['9-15-280']
i just really wanted to apologize again.:::['9-15-281']
and also show you something i think you'll find very exciting.:::['9-15-282']
oh, my god! "crap from the street!":::['9-15-283']
look, ross. in this box......are all the things i got from mugging:::['9-15-284']
that i thought were too special to sell......or smoke.:::['9-15-285']
anyway, i was looking through it, and i found......science boy.:::['9-15-286']
i never thought i'd see this again. phoebe: yeah. what--?:::['9-15-288']
it's all here!:::['9-15-289']
yeah. ross: ha, ha.:::['9-15-290']
what made you save it all these years?:::['9-15-291']
i guess i just thought it was really good.:::['9-15-292']
and maybe it would be worth something one day.:::['9-15-293']
you really thought science boy was worth saving?:::['9-15-294']
yeah. but you should know i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.:::['9-15-295']
still, this is amazing!:::['9-15-296']
oh, my god. thank you, phoebe.:::['9-15-297']
you're welcome. and thank you for science boy. i learned a lot from him.:::['9-15-298']
i need an answer! i can't tell you something i don't know.:::['9-15-300']
you know! i don't know!:::['9-15-301']
i need an answer now! you want an answer? the answer is...:::['9-15-302']
she never loved me. she only loved you.:::['9-15-304']
you knew this all along and you never told me?:::['9-15-305']
i can never forgive you, or myself. i have nothing to live for. bang! and scene!:::['9-15-306']
absolutely amazing.:::['9-15-307']
the part is yours. thanks! now i really got to get going.:::['9-15-308']
wait, wait, wait! congratulations. you did it.:::['9-15-309']
you did it. you can relax now. yeah.:::['9-15-310']
wow! that's a big cable bill.:::['9-15-311']
ha. you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn.:::['9-15-312']
on a saturday afternoon?:::['9-15-313']
i was in the house!:::['9-15-314']
hey, uh, phoebe didn't by any chance mention that--:::['9-15-315']
she was the huge guy that mugged you? yeah.:::['9-15-316']
i see. you didn't happen to tell--:::['9-15-317']
everybody we know? yeah. great. thanks.:::['9-15-318']
morning, roomie. hey!:::['9-14-0']
you remembered to put clothes on this morning.:::['9-14-1']
fifth day's the charm. oh.:::['9-14-2']
it's so great to be back here. you're making it so easy on me and emma.:::['9-14-3']
it's great having you back. stay as long as you want.:::['9-14-4']
and when does she stop crying all night?:::['9-14-5']
hey! you're not naked. heh.:::['9-14-6']
so, hey, rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?:::['9-14-7']
i'll probably be back around 6. but she's in the bedroom, all ready to go.:::['9-14-8']
but she did fall back to sleep, so...:::['9-14-9']
she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.:::['9-14-10']
bye. ross: bye.:::['9-14-11']
hey, i hope emma isn't making it too hard on you.:::['9-14-12']
no, hey, it's been great.:::['9-14-13']
i want you to know that with rachel staying here......all my feelings from before:::['9-14-15']
are totally over.:::['9-14-16']
and even if they weren't......when you walk in:::['9-14-17']
on a woman using a breast pump...:::['9-14-18']
yeah, that'll do it. wow.:::['9-14-19']
so how are you?:::['9-14-20', '10-14-253']
i'm okay. really?:::['9-14-21']
sure. i mean, do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out?:::['9-14-22']
of course. you know, i'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.:::['9-14-23']
well, actually it... it's not a divorce. it is not a divorce!:::['9-14-24']
anyway, i think rachel and i need to get on with our lives.:::['9-14-25']
maybe start seeing other people.:::['9-14-26']
wow. really?:::['9-14-27']
sure, why not? in fact, if you know anyone that'd be good for me?:::['9-14-28']
sure. i know lots of girls. yeah? any names come to mind?:::['9-14-29']
ooh. names?:::['9-14-30']
i was just gonna eat. want something? what you got?:::['9-14-32']
okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots......ooh, strained plums.:::['9-14-33']
we haven't tried that yet.:::['9-14-34']
goody!:::['9-14-35']
thanks. ha, ha.:::['9-14-36']
so how is it living with rachel again?:::['9-14-37']
i mean, apart from the great food? ha, ha.:::['9-14-38']
i'm fine, i'm fine. it's just...:::['9-14-39']
it's just weird what's happening with her and ross.:::['9-14-40']
yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.:::['9-14-41']
rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too.:::['9-14-42']
why are they doing this? i don't know.:::['9-14-43']
they're so perfect for each other. it's crazy.:::['9-14-44']
you know what's crazy? these jars.:::['9-14-45']
what is there, like, two bites in here?:::['9-14-46']
i just wish they'd realize they should be together.:::['9-14-47']
when they moved in together, i figured that's where things were headed.:::['9-14-48']
they should be a family. they should marry and have more children.:::['9-14-49']
yes. and they should name one of their kids joey.:::['9-14-50']
i may not have kids. someone's gotta carry on the family name.:::['9-14-51']
you know what? maybe once they start dating and see what's out there......they'll realize how good:::['9-14-52']
they are for each other.:::['9-14-53']
yeah, because it is slim pickings.:::['9-14-54']
i had this date last night. yuck! mm.:::['9-14-55']
but we should probably keep it down, she's still in the bedroom.:::['9-14-56']
so, what are we gonna do? are we just gonna set them up with people?:::['9-14-57']
i know, that just pushes them further and further apart.:::['9-14-58']
i know what we can do. we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates......so they'll realize:::['9-14-59']
how good they are together.:::['9-14-60']
ooh, that's a great plan. yeah.:::['9-14-61']
you know what the best part of it is? i get to do my plan laugh::::['9-14-62']
okay. shh, shh. not so loud. we don't wanna wake up, uh...:::['9-14-63']
hi. you guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?:::['9-14-64']
see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married?:::['9-14-65']
i mean, i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people.:::['9-14-66']
now if you'll excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries.:::['9-14-67']
i was just asking because i need someone to watch emma tonight.:::['9-14-68']
sure we'll do it. what are you up to?:::['9-14-69']
well, phoebe set me up on a date. oh, my god. wow.:::['9-14-70']
why? what's the big deal? i figured because you and ross are...:::['9-14-71']
what? slept together a year and a half ago? yeah, i'm all set.:::['9-14-72']
i think it's great you're going on a date. it sounds healthy.:::['9-14-73']
i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood.:::['9-14-74']
you want a job? turn off oprah and send out a résumé.:::['9-14-75']
i'll bring her by around 7, okay? that's perfect.:::['9-14-76']
you guys are gonna have so much fun. she's at such a cute age.:::['9-14-77']
a couple things. now that she eats solid food, she poops around the clock.:::['9-14-78']
and watch out for your hair because she likes to grab it.:::['9-14-79']
she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams, but, oh......thanks, you guys. have fun.:::['9-14-80']
suddenly i wish i was reading my own name.:::['9-14-81']
ooh, joey, hey. i'm so excited. hey.:::['9-14-82']
i just set rachel up with the worst guy. all right. who is he?:::['9-14-83']
it's this guy i used to massage. by "massage"......i mean hold down so he wouldn't:::['9-14-84']
turn over and flash me.:::['9-14-85']
okay, okay. wait till you hear who i got for ross. oh, yeah.:::['9-14-86']
she's this really boring woman. she's a teacher.:::['9-14-87']
a teacher? she's into history and foreign movies.:::['9-14-88']
oh, oh. and she loves puzzles. huh?:::['9-14-89']
come on, who loves puzzles?:::['9-14-90']
well, ross does.:::['9-14-91']
you're ruining the plan!:::['9-14-92']
joey, you fixed him up with his perfect woman.:::['9-14-93']
oh, my god, you're right! yeah.:::['9-14-94']
she even reads for pleasure! ugh.:::['9-14-95']
how do you know a woman like that? i'm not allowed to know smart women?:::['9-14-96']
joey? i met her at the library. i went in to pee.:::['9-14-97']
so now what do we do? well, okay.:::['9-14-98']
i'll call her and tell her the date's canceled and find him somebody else.:::['9-14-99']
what if we don't find him somebody else? we'll just tell her the date's off......but we don't tell ross. he goes:::['9-14-100']
to the restaurant and gets stood up.:::['9-14-101']
ooh, i hear that's bad.:::['9-14-103']
ooh, so this is great. rachel's gonna have a terrible date......ross gets stood up, and then they'll:::['9-14-104']
realize how good they have it together.:::['9-14-105']
ah, yes, the plan.:::['9-14-106']
ho-ho-ho.:::['9-14-107', '7-10-237']
it's not santa's plan.:::['9-14-108']
no, it's::::['9-14-109']
yeah, you know, it's not that fun. no, i think we killed it.:::['9-14-110']
emma? emma, look at me.:::['9-14-111']
well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while.:::['9-14-112']
no, no, no. no, no, no. it's okay. it's okay. i didn't go.:::['9-14-113']
don't cry, it's just a bit.:::['9-14-114']
i'm your uncle chandler. funny is all i have!:::['9-14-115']
okay, just so you know, i'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the 6th.:::['9-14-116']
so don't touch yourself for the next 48 hours.:::['9-14-117']
i don't do that.:::['9-14-118', '5-20-50']
i'll try to stop.:::['9-14-119']
wait, did you say until the 6th? yeah.:::['9-14-120']
today is the 6th.:::['9-14-121']
no, it's not. look.:::['9-14-122']
yes, it's also 2003.:::['9-14-123']
oh, my god. today's the 6th?:::['9-14-124']
i may be done ovulating!:::['9-14-125']
i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.:::['9-14-126']
go take the test, see if we're okay. okay.:::['9-14-127']
tough crib.:::['9-14-128']
hey, where are all my ovulation sticks? there's only one here.:::['9-14-129']
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.:::['9-14-130']
i am not working! there's not much to do around here!:::['9-14-132']
excuse me. um... heh.:::['9-14-133']
is there a woman waiting at the bar?:::['9-14-134']
um, someone average height, dark hair? or perhaps doing a puzzle?:::['9-14-135']
uh, there's a drunk chinese guy.:::['9-14-136']
well, if i'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.:::['9-14-137']
um, can i get you another glass of wine?:::['9-14-138']
i don't know if i should. i don't wanna be drunk when i......go home alone tonight.:::['9-14-139']
got stood up, huh? eh, it's no big deal. it's just a blind date.:::['9-14-140']
are you worried your date came, saw you and left?:::['9-14-141']
we're okay. i'm still ovulating.:::['9-14-143']
oh, good, because as of 4:00 this afternoon, i am not.:::['9-14-144']
so let's do this.:::['9-14-145']
i don't think i can. oh, come on.:::['9-14-146']
i know you're not 18 anymore, but give it a minute.:::['9-14-147']
because of emma. oh, my god, emma.:::['9-14-148']
oh, sweetie, i forgot you were here.:::['9-14-149']
oh, you're right, we can't do this. we can't leave her alone.:::['9-14-150']
unless......maybe we do it here.:::['9-14-152']
i mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?:::['9-14-153']
well, she's aware when we leave a room. she may notice if we start......canoodling in it.:::['9-14-154']
"canoodling"? well, i can't say "hump" or "screw"......in front of the b-a-b-y.:::['9-14-155']
i don't know, i guess having sex in front of a baby......isn't so...:::['9-14-156']
horrifying? scarring?:::['9-14-157']
something people go to jail for?:::['9-14-158']
i guess you're right. you guess?:::['9-14-159']
at that bed-and-breakfast, we didn't have sex......because you thought a deer:::['9-14-160']
was staring through the window.:::['9-14-161']
well, what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?:::['9-14-162']
wow, everything looks so good.:::['9-14-163']
i think i'm gonna have the chicken.:::['9-14-164']
i just have to say this.:::['9-14-165']
you're really beautiful. oh. wow, that's very sweet. thank you.:::['9-14-166']
i'm kind of funny-looking.:::['9-14-167']
what? look, i mean, come on......you're way out of my league.:::['9-14-168']
everybody in here knows it.:::['9-14-169']
i bet that guy over there is probably saying::::['9-14-170']
"ooh, why's she out with him? he must be rich.":::['9-14-171']
well, i'm not.:::['9-14-172']
what do you think you want to order? i'm real excited about that chicken.:::['9-14-173']
i'm not funny, either.:::['9-14-174']
so if you were thinking, "well, he's not that good-looking......but maybe we'll have some laughs,":::['9-14-175']
that ain't gonna happen.:::['9-14-176']
well, come on, steve, let's not rule out nervous laughter. ha-ha-ha.:::['9-14-177']
hey, now, wait a minute, phoebe told me......that you owned:::['9-14-178']
your own restaurant. that's impressive.:::['9-14-179']
i lost it to drugs.:::['9-14-180']
i silk-screen t-shirts now.:::['9-14-181']
really? what's that like?:::['9-14-182']
it's really fulfilling doing something you hate for no money.:::['9-14-183']
that's right. i have no money, i'm not funny......i live in a studio apartment:::['9-14-184']
with two other guys.:::['9-14-185']
and i'm pretty sure i'm infertile.:::['9-14-186']
now, come on. come on, steve.:::['9-14-187']
there must be something that you like about yourself.:::['9-14-188']
i do like my hair.:::['9-14-189']
hello? phoebe, it's me!:::['9-14-191']
i'm going to hunt you down and kill you.:::['9-14-192']
this is the worst date ever! how could you set me up with this creep?:::['9-14-194']
you know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.:::['9-14-195']
i don't care. this guy is a nightmare.:::['9-14-196']
all right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.:::['9-14-197']
he's not stoned. did he go out for a cigarette?:::['9-14-198']
yeah. four times. my dear, sweet rach.:::['9-14-199']
well, our plan is working. rachel's having a miserable time......and ross is just stood up somewhere:::['9-14-201']
at a restaurant all alone.:::['9-14-202']
great. pretty soon they'll be back together.:::['9-14-203']
by the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny mexico.:::['9-14-204']
oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.:::['9-14-205']
oh, she's asleep. chandler?:::['9-14-206']
what are you doing? emma was doing it.:::['9-14-207']
she's asleep.:::['9-14-208']
she's asleep. that means we can... yes. but we have to be fast.:::['9-14-210']
oh, okay, i'll try.:::['9-14-211']
and you can't make any noise. okay, i'll try.:::['9-14-212']
emma?:::['9-14-214']
hey! hi!:::['9-14-215']
how are you? how are you?:::['9-14-216']
where are your babysitters, huh?:::['9-14-217']
why is the bedroom door closed?:::['9-14-218']
you can't have s-e-x when you're taking care of a b-a-b-i-e.:::['9-14-219']
i've got bad news. the chinese guy left.:::['9-14-220']
eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.:::['9-14-221']
look, you got stood up. who cares?:::['9-14-222']
we're gonna show you a good time. sit and relax.:::['9-14-223']
in fact, let me bring you a crab-cake appetizer on the house.:::['9-14-224']
wow, free crab cakes? well, that's nice.:::['9-14-225']
although i was hoping to have sex tonight. heh.:::['9-14-226']
just the crab cakes.:::['9-14-228']
what are you doing? are you trying to get him to stay? you can't do that.:::['9-14-229']
just get out of here, okay? i'm sorry, what's going on?:::['9-14-230']
uh, okay, um, the waiters have a little pool going.:::['9-14-231']
we have a bet on how long it'll take before you give up and go home.:::['9-14-232']
you're making money off my misery?:::['9-14-234']
well, if you stay till 9:20, i am.:::['9-14-235']
this is unbelievable. i have never been so insulted in my life.:::['9-14-236']
now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, i'll be on my way.:::['9-14-237']
well, that was weird. you were loud and i was fast.:::['9-14-238']
i think we may have done it this time.:::['9-14-239']
oh, i wish i didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.:::['9-14-240']
you may wanna get some more of those too.:::['9-14-241']
where's emma?:::['9-14-242']
oh, my god, where's emma? where's emma?:::['9-14-243']
don't ask me. i was in there canoodling you.:::['9-14-244']
okay. okay. i'm sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma.:::['9-14-245']
you go look across the hall, i'll call her cell.:::['9-14-246']
okay. you better hope we're pregnant......because one way or another,we're giving a baby back to rachel!:::['9-14-247']
i can't believe i'm crying in front of you.:::['9-14-248']
you must think i'm so pathetic.:::['9-14-249']
no, no, no, i admire a man who can cry.:::['9-14-250']
really? don't touch my coat!:::['9-14-251']
oh. sorry, that's my phone.:::['9-14-252']
hello? hey, rach, how's it going?:::['9-14-253']
oh, my god, this is the worst date ever.:::['9-14-254']
oh, come on.:::['9-14-255', '5-18-207', '5-11-132', '4-14-100', '4-14-229']
look, you know what, i'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well?:::['9-14-256']
what's up? hey, did you stop by here?:::['9-14-257']
no. oh, my god! then...:::['9-14-258']
oh, thank god! emma, there you are!:::['9-14-259']
what? what do you mean, "there you are"? where was she?:::['9-14-260']
uh, we were playing peekaboo. she loves it when i'm dramatic. heh.:::['9-14-261']
why the hell did you take her? because you two were having sex!:::['9-14-262']
no, we weren't. don't you lie to me.:::['9-14-263']
i can tell by chandler's hair. you are so lazy. can't you get on top for once?:::['9-14-264']
all right. all right, we were.:::['9-14-265']
we were trying to make a baby. monica's ovulating.:::['9-14-266']
it is unacceptable that you'd have sex with emma in the next room.:::['9-14-267']
i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this. no, please don't. she will kill us.:::['9-14-268']
hey, i gotta. unless...:::['9-14-269']
unless what?:::['9-14-270', '7-19-150']
unless you name your first-born child joey.:::['9-14-271']
what? why? hey, i may never have kids......and somebody's gotta:::['9-14-272']
carry on my family name.:::['9-14-273']
your family name is tribbiani.:::['9-14-274']
oh, ha, ha. you almost had me.:::['9-14-275']
well, um... look......i think i know the answer:::['9-14-276']
to this question, but......would you like to make love to me?:::['9-14-277']
really, really not.:::['9-14-278']
ah, it's just as well.:::['9-14-279']
it doesn't work anyway.:::['9-14-280']
all right, well, that's good to know. good night, steve.:::['9-14-281']
hey, what's wrong? i just had a rough night.:::['9-14-282']
oh. crab cake?:::['9-14-283']
well, what happened? uh...:::['9-14-285']
well, i... it's kind of weird to talk to you about this, but...:::['9-14-286']
monica told me you had a blind date.:::['9-14-287']
yeah. i did too. oh.:::['9-14-288']
uh, but is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?:::['9-14-289']
oh, no. do you think she walked in, saw you and left?:::['9-14-291']
why does everyone keep saying that?:::['9-14-292']
if it makes you feel any better, i wish my date hadn't shown up.:::['9-14-293']
that bad? well, he makes t-shirts for a living......and he thought it would be:::['9-14-294']
appropriate to give me......this.:::['9-14-295']
"female body inspector"?:::['9-14-296']
what size is that? ugh.:::['9-14-297']
now wait a minute. so they'll name their first child joey? uh-huh.:::['9-14-298']
how do i get them to name the next one after me?:::['9-14-299']
it's easy. you just walk in on them having sex.:::['9-14-300']
oh, so they owe me, like, three phoebes.:::['9-14-301']
oh, my god! look, it's ross and rachel!:::['9-14-302']
the plan is working!:::['9-14-303']
don't do the plan laugh.:::['9-14-304']
the first dates we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.:::['9-14-305']
huh. you know, it is weird......that phoebe would set me up:::['9-14-307']
on a date that was awful......on the same night joey set you up:::['9-14-308']
on a date that didn't even show.:::['9-14-309']
you don't think it was intentional?:::['9-14-311']
i mean, that's just stupid.:::['9-14-312']
we're geniuses. huh?:::['9-14-313']
look at them! they're really bonding. they're falling in love all over again.:::['9-14-314']
oh, they see us. oh, they look mad.:::['9-14-315']
oh, they figured it out. they're coming. run!:::['9-14-316']
where? mexico!:::['9-14-317']
can you believe they're still not here?:::['9-14-318']
i know. a double blind date and we both get stood up.:::['9-14-319']
i know, i'm so bummed.:::['9-14-321']
could we have our free crab cakes now?:::['9-14-322']
what? we've been stood up.:::['9-14-323']
and we want our free crab cakes.:::['9-14-324']
guys, give it a rest. nobody's betting on you tonight.:::['9-14-325']
although we do have a pool going to see how long it takes that guy to cry.:::['9-14-326']
i have such fat hands!:::['9-14-327']
hey, out of all of us, who do you think will get married next?:::['7-20-0']
probably monica and chandler.:::['7-20-1']
hi, could i have a pack of newport lights?:::['7-20-2']
oh, um, uh, we don't sell cigarettes, but they do across the street.:::['7-20-3']
that'd be great. thanks.:::['7-20-4']
oh, my god. melissa worbert. i don't think i have the energy for this.:::['7-20-5']
oh, my god! ray-ray green?:::['7-20-6']

um, so listen, just call me. here's my card. oh, wow, thanks.:::['7-20-25']
oh, you're in real estate? oh, no, heh, that's an old card.:::['7-20-26']
um, i got out of that to do something where i could......help people and make a difference.:::['7-20-27']
wow. what do you do now?:::['7-20-28']
i'm a party planner.:::['7-20-29']
hey guys, look who's back. it's ray-ray.:::['7-20-31']
that was my friend, melissa, from college.:::['7-20-32']
she seems really, really fun!:::['7-20-33']
she's actually very sweet, and we used to be very close.:::['7-20-34']
wait a minute. she's not the one who you?:::['7-20-35']
who you what? who you what?:::['7-20-36']
yes. wow!:::['7-20-37']
wow... wow, what? who you what?:::['7-20-38']
oh, it's not a big deal.:::['7-20-39']
they were lovers.:::['7-20-40']
no, we weren't. it was nothing.:::['7-20-42']
it was one night, senior year, and we went to a party......had a lot of sangria,and you know, ended up......kissing for a bit.:::['7-20-43']
so that's two of my wives.:::['7-20-44']
okay, so this is where the band is. and here's the bar.:::['7-20-45']
and all these pins have people's names on them. rach, here you are.:::['7-20-46']
oh, wow!:::['7-20-47', '10-4-112']
why don't we just put me with a manhattan in my hand......talking to the cute bartender.:::['7-20-48']
these pins aren't for playing, are they?:::['7-20-49']
okay, the red ones are my guests, and the blue are yours.:::['7-20-50']
this is so sad. i only have like 10 pins.:::['7-20-51']
heh, chandler, relax. it's not a contest.:::['7-20-52']
certainly not a close one.:::['7-20-53']
hello. hey.:::['7-20-54']
stop picturing it!:::['7-20-56']
okay, i think that's it. the seating chart is done. this is our wedding.:::['7-20-57']
wow. they all look like they're having fun.:::['7-20-58']
so where are my parents gonna be?:::['7-20-59']
well, if this is the wedding hall, then, um......your parents would be over here:::['7-20-61']
at home in queens.:::['7-20-62']
they're not invited? oh, no, they're gonna be crushed!:::['7-20-63']
why would they think they're invited?:::['7-20-64']
you got me. i don't...:::['7-20-65']
joey! look, i thought parents were coming.:::['7-20-66']
your parents are coming. chandler's parents are coming.:::['7-20-67']
ross' parents are coming.:::['7-20-68']
ross' parents are my parents.:::['7-20-69']
well, see, parents are coming.:::['7-20-70']
we should invite them. you just want more blue pins.:::['7-20-71']
well, this is just sad.:::['7-20-72']
all right. maybe i can fit them in if i just do some rearranging.:::['7-20-73']
rachel may have to sit at the bar.:::['7-20-74']
that is not a problem.:::['7-20-75']
maybe you'll order a little sangria. oh, get out of here!:::['7-20-76']
these are our tuxedos. if you like anything, we can make a deal.:::['7-20-77']
anything at all. but these are the three that monica pre-approved.:::['7-20-78']
uh, well, thanks a lot for hooking me up.:::['7-20-79']
and i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest.:::['7-20-80']
i'm monica's maid of honor.:::['7-20-81']
okay, don't try to blue-pin me.:::['7-20-82']
well, these look nice. they are nice.:::['7-20-83']
when celebrities are done with them, they send them back.:::['7-20-84']
you mean, like, for award shows? some of them.:::['7-20-85']
they've been down the red carpet with people yelling, uh......"who are you wearing?:::['7-20-86']
you look fabulous!":::['7-20-87']
might i suggest watching a little more espn......and a little less e!:::['7-20-88']
okay. who wore those?:::['7-20-89']
rachel: uh...:::['7-20-90']
well, uh, this one's tom brokaw. not bad.:::['7-20-91']
this one is, uh, paul o'neil.:::['7-20-92']
who's that?:::['7-20-93', '3-15-277', '3-16-13']
he plays for the yankees. seriously, espn.:::['7-20-94']
just once in a while. have it on in the background.:::['7-20-95']
ooh, this one was pierce brosnan. pierce brosnan? uh-huh.:::['7-20-96']
this is james bond's tux? oh, i have to get married in james bond's tux.:::['7-20-98']
ha, ha. it's a pretty cool tux.:::['7-20-99']
ah, it's not just that. i would be england's most powerful weapon.:::['7-20-100']
a jet-setting heartbreaker on her majesty's secret service.:::['7-20-101']
a man who fears no one, with a license to kill.:::['7-20-102']
would monica let me wear this?:::['7-20-103']
we should really learn how to play the real way.:::['7-20-104']
i like our way.:::['7-20-105']
ah! hey, hey!:::['7-20-106']
chess!:::['7-20-107']
nice move. yeah.:::['7-20-108']
hey. phoebe & joey: hey.:::['7-20-109', '4-13-183']
i hooked ross and chandler up with tuxedos. do you need one?:::['7-20-110']
no, i'm not wearing a tux.:::['7-20-111']
what are you gonna wear? multi-colored robes.:::['7-20-112']
ooh, and maybe a hat.:::['7-20-113']
huh. does monica know about this? no.:::['7-20-114']
can i please be there when you tell her?:::['7-20-115']
hey, rach, you want to go to a movie tonight?:::['7-20-116']
oh, i can't. i'm having dinner with melissa.:::['7-20-117']
can i come?:::['7-20-118']
i won't talk. you'll just hear my video camera.:::['7-20-119']
what? what's going on? can i tell her?:::['7-20-120']
do you want what happened, or joey's lewd version?:::['7-20-121']
joey's. okay.:::['7-20-122']
okay, come on.:::['7-20-123', '3-25-161']
i had this college friend......and i made the mistake:::['7-20-124']
of telling joey that one time......she and i, you know,kissed a little bit.:::['7-20-125']
yeah, i'm sure that happened.:::['7-20-126']
it did. sure.:::['7-20-127']
hey, heh. it happened.:::['7-20-128']
yeah, it was senior year. it was after the sigma chi luau......and melissa and i got very drunk.:::['7-20-129']
and we ended up kissing. for several minutes.:::['7-20-130']
which means she had a couple spritzers and a peck on the cheek.:::['7-20-131']
why are you taking this away from me? ugh.:::['7-20-132']
why is it so hard for you to believe?:::['7-20-133']
okay. i just didn't know that you were a lesbian.:::['7-20-134']
i'm not saying that i'm a lesbian. i'm just saying that this happened.:::['7-20-135']
it just seems pretty wild. and you're... you know, so......vanilla.:::['7-20-136']
vanilla? i'm not vanilla. i do lots of crazy things.:::['7-20-137']
i mean, i got drunk and married in vegas.:::['7-20-138']
to ross.:::['7-20-139']
if you don't believe me......just come with me to dinner tonight:::['7-20-140']
and she'll tell you.:::['7-20-141']
okay. because i can't picture it.:::['7-20-142']
you should get inside my head.:::['7-20-143']
guess what i got for your wedding?:::['7-20-145']
a freakishly thin date with a hanger for a head?:::['7-20-146']
rachel hooked me up with a tux. but not just any tux.:::['7-20-147']
batman's tux!:::['7-20-148']
made expressly for val kilmer, and worn by him in the hit film......that batman film he was in.:::['7-20-150']
you can't wear that. i'm wearing the famous tux.:::['7-20-151']
james bond's tux. so?:::['7-20-152']
if you wear that, it'll make mine less special.:::['7-20-153']
you need something to to make it special?:::['7-20-154']
hello! you have the most special thing of all.:::['7-20-155']
you are marrying the woman you love.:::['7-20-156']
don't take away my cool thing. pretty please?:::['7-20-157']
"pretty please?" not very, uh, 007.:::['7-20-158']
if you were getting married, i'd never do anything to upset you.:::['7-20-159']
you slept with my sister. that was pretty 007.:::['7-20-160']
hey. hey. okay, good. you're here.:::['7-20-161']
all right, i figured it out.:::['7-20-162']
i'm gonna take 2 tables of 8, add your parents......and make them into 3 tables of 6.:::['7-20-163']
and i called the caterer. we are good to go!:::['7-20-164']
yeah. they're not coming.:::['7-20-165']
they think that you only invited them because of me.:::['7-20-167']
they feel unwanted.:::['7-20-168']
that's too bad. it's true. but too bad.:::['7-20-169']
if you could just call my mom. oh, joey.:::['7-20-170']
come on. just let her know you want them there.:::['7-20-171']
let's not forget this is a woman who has sent you many lasagnas.:::['7-20-172']
no, she hasn't. is it her fault if some didn't make it to you?:::['7-20-173']
just tell them you mixed up invitations. no, no, no, blame it on the post office.:::['7-20-175']
they hate the post office. and the irish.:::['7-20-176']
but i don't think you could blame it on them.:::['7-20-177']
hello? yeah, hi. uh, mrs. tribbiani? hi, this is monica geller.:::['7-20-178']
i'm just calling to say that i really hope you can make the wedding.:::['7-20-179']
apparently some of our invitations weren't delivered.:::['7-20-180']
um, i guess there was some screw-up at the damn post office.:::['7-20-181']
tell me about it.:::['7-20-182', '2-18-159', '5-18-248']
yeah, the u.s. post office? no. more like u.s. lost office.:::['7-20-183']
what are they, irish?:::['7-20-184']
anyway, his name's allen. and we've been going out for three years.:::['7-20-185']
he was my first client when i became a party planner.:::['7-20-186']
he was actually planning a party for his girlfriend at the time.:::['7-20-187']
oh, well. no.:::['7-20-188']
ah. he was theta beta pi at syracuse. oh! oh, that's great.:::['7-20-189']
phoebe, were you ever in a sorority? of course.:::['7-20-191']
yes. i was a, um, thigh mega tampon.:::['7-20-192']
what one?:::['7-20-193', '5-7-133']
yeah, we were huge too. but they had to shut us down......when regina phalangie:::['7-20-194']
died of alcohol poisoning.:::['7-20-195']
isn't it a shame when one girl ruins it for the whole bunch?:::['7-20-197']
hmm. mm-hm. ugh.:::['7-20-198']
speaking of drinking too much, i was, uh, telling phoebe......about that crazy night after the:::['7-20-200']
sigma chi luau where we made out.:::['7-20-201']
remember we... come on, we had sarongs on and the coconut bikini tops.:::['7-20-203']
we went back to the house and got really silly......and we made out.:::['7-20-204']
wow, ray-ray, i have no idea what you're talking about.:::['7-20-205']
ross is batman.:::['7-20-207']
well, he did manage to keep his identity secret for a long time.:::['7-20-208']
rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman.:::['7-20-209']
batman is so much cooler than james bond.:::['7-20-210']
what? 007 has all those gadgets. batman has a utility belt.:::['7-20-211']
007 has a fancy car. batman has the batmobile.:::['7-20-212']
007 gets all the ladies. heh. batman has robin.:::['7-20-213']
we get espn, right?:::['7-20-214']
how about you go put on your 007 tuxedo, and i'll make you a nice martini?:::['7-20-215']
actually i don't like martinis.:::['7-20-216']
a yoo-hoo with a funny straw? ooh, yum.:::['7-20-217']
i know the invitation says 6:00......but does that mean get there at 6,or the show starts at 6?:::['7-20-219']
the show?:::['7-20-220']
right, the wedding. gotcha.:::['7-20-221']
but weddings start a little late, right?:::['7-20-222']
have you ever been to one of my weddings?:::['7-20-223']
ah, well, it's the same day as my niece's christening......and i want my parents to see me.:::['7-20-224']
my part's in the beginning. i'm not in the rest of the show... wedding.:::['7-20-225']
the wedding starts at 6.:::['7-20-226']
okay. i totally hear you.:::['7-20-227']
ooh! how about this? i vamp till they get there.:::['7-20-228']
heh. you'll "vamp"?:::['7-20-229']
yeah, yeah, like warm up the crowd. ask where they're from.:::['7-20-230']
in joey tribbiani, you get a minister and an entertainer.:::['7-20-231']
i'm a "ministainer.":::['7-20-232']
all right?:::['7-20-233', '5-24-78', '5-20-178', '5-20-246', '5-2-171']
there's no one better. there's no one greater.:::['7-20-234']
how can you not remember us kissing?:::['7-20-236']
i don't know. i don't remember a lot of things that never happened.:::['7-20-237']
wha...:::['7-20-238']
remember, we were on the sleeping porch? we couldn't stop giggling.:::['7-20-239']
our coconuts kept knocking together.:::['7-20-240']
somewhere joey's head is exploding.:::['7-20-241']
i don't want to make you uncomfortable......but i told phoebe it happened,and she doesn't believe me.:::['7-20-242']
i'm sorry. i mean, if i thought it happened, i would say it.:::['7-20-243']
maybe i passed out and you did stuff to me while i was sleeping.:::['7-20-244']
it's okay, you don't have to do this. i believe you.:::['7-20-246']
if you say you kissed melissa, then you kissed melissa.:::['7-20-247']
thank you, phoebe. okay.:::['7-20-248']
but she didn't. i know.:::['7-20-249']
hey. hey. you carry that around?:::['7-20-250']
yes. i find it to be something of a conversation piece.:::['7-20-251']
between you and? gunther.:::['7-20-252']
hey, hey. why don't we put them on?:::['7-20-253']
get a picture of batman and james bond, together.:::['7-20-254']
i would, but my pants are a little tight.:::['7-20-255']
a little tight? i could see 00 and 7 in those things.:::['7-20-256']
i was looking forward to wearing our celebrity tuxes together.:::['7-20-257']
so you're not gonna be wearing yours? are you kidding? it's batman's tux!:::['7-20-258']
let me try it on.:::['7-20-259']
okay. but just the jacket. 00 and 7 are not getting in there.:::['7-20-260']
holy double-vented comfort, batman!:::['7-20-262']
what's this? ross: huh?:::['7-20-263']
an invitation to the at first sight premiere?:::['7-20-264']
oh, my god. val kilmer didn't wear this in batman.:::['7-20-265']
he wore it to the premiere of a fruity love story where he was a blind guy.:::['7-20-266']
the only super power you have is the slightly heightened sense of smell.:::['7-20-269']
hey. uh, can i talk to you guys for a second?:::['7-20-270']
i give up. whatever you want, you can have it.:::['7-20-271']
you want to sing a song or do a dance?:::['7-20-272']
you want your mom at the altar screaming racial slurs? i don't care.:::['7-20-273']
no. i just want to thank you guys for what you did for my parents.:::['7-20-274']
they're so happy to get to be a part of your special day.:::['7-20-275']
well, your welcome. tell them we're glad they're coming.:::['7-20-277']
i will. oh, check out what they got me to wear for the ceremony!:::['7-20-278']
i wear it like this when i marry you guys. and then this......is for party time.:::['7-20-280']
it happened. i am telling you it happened.:::['7-20-281']
hey, it was great meeting you.:::['7-20-282']
and, uh, rachel? i don't think i'll be calling you because, uh......you know, you've gotten weird.:::['7-20-283']
take care, you guys.:::['7-20-284']
wha... wait a minute. okay, look.:::['7-20-285']
that night was the one wild thing i've ever done in my life.:::['7-20-286']
i won't let you take it away from me.:::['7-20-287']
so if you don't remember that, maybe you'll remember this...:::['7-20-288']
oh, my god. you love me.:::['7-20-289']
what? of course i remember our kiss.:::['7-20-290']
i think about it all the time.:::['7-20-291']
i can still hear the coconuts knocking together, i...:::['7-20-292']
i didn't want to tell you, because i didn't think you'd return my love.:::['7-20-293']
aw! look who's being suddenly shy.:::['7-20-295']
you have to feel what i feel.:::['7-20-296']
nobody can kiss that good and not mean it.:::['7-20-297']
i'm just a good kisser.:::['7-20-298']
oh, you don't have to be sorry.:::['7-20-302']
i'm obviously kidding.:::['7-20-303']
i'm not in love with you. i'm not in love with her.:::['7-20-304']
i don't hear coconuts banging together.:::['7-20-305']
i don't picture your face when i make love to my boyfriend.:::['7-20-306']
anyway, i gotta go.:::['7-20-307']
a kiss goodbye?:::['7-20-308']
no? okay.:::['7-20-309', '3-4-73']
i mean, i had no idea that that would...:::['7-20-311']
just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.:::['7-20-313']
and? i've had better.:::['7-20-314']
chandler: i found one that fits.:::['7-20-315']
well, you know what they say? 23rd time's a charm.:::['7-20-316']
aw! look at you, all handsome.:::['7-20-317']
whose is it? oh, does it matter?:::['7-20-318']
all that matters is that you look so handsome.:::['7-20-319']
whose is it? i don't want to say.:::['7-20-320']
come on, i don't care. whose is it?:::['7-20-321']
diane keaton.:::['7-20-322']
do you realize we're getting married in four weeks?:::['7-21-0']
four weeks, baby. four weeks!:::['7-21-1']
you realize you get louder each week?:::['7-21-2']
there's still so much to do! have you written your vows?:::['7-21-3']
i figured i'd just buy those. "pat, i'd like to buy a vow." ha, ha.:::['7-21-4']
you know i've no sense of humor when it comes to this.:::['7-21-5']
right. have you written yours yet? no, but i know what i'm gonna say.:::['7-21-6']
do you happen to know what i'm gonna say?:::['7-21-7']
let's do it now. it won't be hard.:::['7-21-8']
say what's in your heart.:::['7-21-9']
chandler: look at her go. she must love me more than i love her!:::['7-21-10']
what's wrong with me? ooh, don't open that door.:::['7-21-11']
phew. "monica, there are no words...":::['7-21-12']
there are no words! this shouldn't be this hard!:::['7-21-13']
uh... oh! you've done this before. what did you say in your vows?:::['7-21-14']
with carol i promised never to love another woman until i die.:::['7-21-15']
she made no such promise.:::['7-21-16']
i'm pathetic. monica knows what to say, you should have seen her.:::['7-21-17']
rachel: what's the emergency?:::['7-21-18']
you have to help me write my vows. all i have is this.:::['7-21-19']
i like the pretty drawing of you in the wedding dress.:::['7-21-20']
thank you. except your breasts look small.:::['7-21-21']
those are my eyes!:::['7-21-22']
those are my breasts. oh, yeah.:::['7-21-23']
why don't you start with something simple? like, um::::['7-21-24']
"monica, from the moment i met you i knew i loved you.":::['7-21-25']
everyone, this is chandler.:::['7-21-27']
hi, i'm ross' little sister.:::['7-21-28', '5-8-132']
okay, okay. um, maybe you could start with::::['7-21-30']
"chandler, even though we were friends......there was a part of me:::['7-21-31']
that knew i wanted more.":::['7-21-32']
all right, there's a nuclear holocaust. i'm the last man on earth.:::['7-21-33']
would you go out with me?:::['7-21-34', '4-1-107']
ooh! are we allowed to lie in the vows?:::['7-21-35']
okay, don't talk about those feelings. just say something about......all the things:::['7-21-36']
he's taught you, like...:::['7-21-37']
or all the things you taught him.:::['7-21-38']
everybody knows the erogenous zones. one, two, three......four, five, six and seven.:::['7-21-39']
there are seven?:::['7-21-40', '4-11-210']
that's one? heh, heh. kind of an important one.:::['7-21-41']
i was looking at it upside down.:::['7-21-42', '4-11-215']
ha. you know, sometimes that helps.:::['7-21-43']
okay, start out with a little one......a two, a one-two-three......a three, a five......a four, a three-two......two, a two-four-six.:::['7-21-44']
two-four-six, four, two......two, four-seven......five-seven, six-seven......seven, seven......seven, seven, seven......seven!:::['7-21-45']
seven.:::['7-21-46']
oh! i got it. how about something like::::['7-21-47']
"monica, when i look back over our time together...":::['7-21-48']
yeah? i can't do all of it.:::['7-21-49']
look back over your time together.:::['7-21-50']
monica: oh, look, twins!:::['7-21-51']
no fair! i don't even have one, how come they get two?:::['7-21-52']
you'll get one. yeah, when?:::['7-21-53']
all right, i'll tell you what.:::['7-21-54']
when we're 40, if neither of us are married......what do you say we have one?:::['7-21-55']
why wouldn't i be married?:::['7-21-56']
hypothetically, why won't i be married?:::['7-21-58']
what is it? is there something unmarriable about me?:::['7-21-60']
uh... uh... well?:::['7-21-61']
dear god, this parachute is a knapsack!:::['7-21-62']
ross: i'm getting married today!:::['7-21-63']
think he knew i was here?:::['7-21-64']
monica: wait, wait, wait.:::['7-21-66', '5-8-334']
look, monica... ah!:::['7-21-67']
this is not gonna work. i bet this'll work.:::['7-21-68']
you are so great! i love you.:::['7-21-69']
monica: what?:::['7-21-70', '2-3-319', '2-22-213']
i said you're so great, and then i stopped talking.:::['7-21-71']
you said you love me! no, i didn't.:::['7-21-72']
yes, you did. no, i didn't!:::['7-21-73']
you love me! no, i don't!:::['7-21-74']
stop it! stop it!:::['7-21-75']
you know, i was thinking, what if i, uh, unpack here?:::['7-21-76']
then all your stuff would be here.:::['7-21-77']
what if it was here?:::['7-21-79']
we wanted to surprise you.:::['7-21-84']
chandler......in all my life......i never thought i'd be so lucky......as to fall in love with my best...:::['7-21-86']
my best... there's a reason why girls don't do this!:::['7-21-87']
okay, okay, okay! i'll do it.:::['7-21-88']
i thought...:::['7-21-89', '4-24-40']
i can do this.:::['7-21-90']
i thought......that it mattered what i said:::['7-21-91']
or where i said it.:::['7-21-92']
then i realized the only thing that matters is that you...:::['7-21-93']
and if you let me......i'll spend the rest of my life:::['7-21-95']
joey: can we come in? we're dying out here!:::['7-21-100']
we're engaged! all: yes!:::['7-21-102']
joey & ross: hey. rachel: hey.:::['7-21-103']
hi. what have you guys been up to?:::['7-21-104']
uh, helping chandler write his vows. he kicked us out.:::['7-21-105']
joey kept making inappropriate suggestions.:::['7-21-106']
how is "monica, i love your sweet ass" inappropriate?:::['7-21-107']
how's monica doing?:::['7-21-108']
lucky she's got a sweet ass. she's not so good at writing.:::['7-21-109']
in four weeks they're gonna be married!:::['7-21-110']
let's just hope it works.:::['7-21-111']
nine out of 10 marriages end in divorce.:::['7-21-112']
heh. that's not true.:::['7-21-113']
you're right. how's the missus?:::['7-21-114']
i can't believe......they're together 3 years.:::['7-21-115']
that long?:::['7-21-116']
it seems like less because they hid it from us.:::['7-21-117']
joey: hey, it's me. coming in.:::['7-21-118']
i've had a very long, hard day.:::['7-21-119', '5-2-4']
uh, i'm getting chicken. want some? uh, no. bye, then.:::['7-21-120']
are you okay? i'm so sorry.:::['7-21-121']
he wouldn't leave. he kept asking if i wanted chicken.:::['7-21-122']
i could eat some chicken.:::['7-21-124', '5-2-13']
hey, joe!:::['7-21-125', '5-2-14']
can i get a, uh, three-piece, uh, coleslaw, beans and a coke?:::['7-21-126']
diet coke.:::['7-21-127']
why didn't they tell us? i know, we were cool about it.:::['7-21-128']
you? and you?:::['7-21-129', '5-5-294']
you cannot tell. no one knows.:::['7-21-130']
how? when?:::['7-21-131']
it happened in london. in london?:::['7-21-132']
indistinctly]:::['7-21-133']
we didn't want to make a big deal out of it.:::['7-21-134']
but it is a big deal!:::['7-21-135']
i have to tell someone. no, no!:::['7-21-136']
you can't. please!:::['7-21-137']
we don't want to deal with telling them. just promise you won't tell.:::['7-21-138']
i can't wait to be with you.:::['7-21-140', '5-11-179']
i'll tell rachel i'm doing laundry.:::['7-21-141']
chandler: laundry, huh? is that my new nickname?:::['7-21-142']

actually, it looks really good. it looks pretty good!:::['7-21-157']
phoebe: get in here! come on!:::['7-21-158']
so they don't know that rachel knows?:::['7-21-159']
yes, but it doesn't matter who knows what.:::['7-21-160']
enough of us know. we can just tell them we know.:::['7-21-161']
the lying and the secrets will be over.:::['7-21-162']
or, we can not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.:::['7-21-163']
we better go if we're gonna catch that movie.:::['7-21-164']
bye. rachel & chandler: bye.:::['7-21-165']

did you see the inappropriate pinching?:::['7-21-167']
actually, i did.:::['7-21-168', '5-14-145']
so now do you believe that she's attracted to me?:::['7-21-169', '5-14-146']
oh, my god! my god, she knows about us!:::['7-21-170']
phoebe knows about us! i didn't tell them.:::['7-21-171']
them? who's them?:::['7-21-172']
uh, phoebe and joey.:::['7-21-173', '5-14-158']
joey!:::['7-21-174', '5-9-40']

they made me promise not to tell.:::['7-21-176']
they think they are so slick, messing with us!:::['7-21-177']
they don't know that we know that they know.:::['7-21-178']
so... ah, yes!:::['7-21-179']
the messers become the messees!:::['7-21-180']
my god, he wants me to come over and feel his biceps!:::['7-21-181']

they don't know that we know they know we know.:::['7-21-189', '5-14-213']
joey, you can't say anything.:::['7-21-190']
couldn't if i wanted to.:::['7-21-191', '5-14-215']
this is totally getting out of hand.:::['7-21-192']

okay. we're about an hour away from getting the scene lit.:::['7-23-68']
so, uh, can you guys run it a couple times? yeah, sure.:::['7-23-69']
all right. let's do it.:::['7-23-70']
we have to find the platoon! forget the platoon. the platoon is gone!:::['7-23-72']
what? the platoon's dead! face facts, tony!:::['7-23-73']
what'll we do? we have no reinforcements or food.:::['7-23-74']
there's food in the basement. potatoes and some pasta.:::['7-23-75']
hang on. joey, you keep touching your face.:::['7-23-76']
something wrong?:::['7-23-77', '3-19-316']
i thought it might be a cool character thing.:::['7-23-80']
he's a face toucher.:::['7-23-81']
let's take it back to richard's last lines. action!:::['7-23-83']
we may not have any weapons, but we still have food.:::['7-23-84']
potatoes, pasta......and a few tins of tuna!:::['7-23-85']
honey, we gotta go! okay.:::['7-23-86']
here's a question you never want to ask::::['7-23-87']
my dad just called and wants to know if he can borrow one of your pearl necklaces?:::['7-23-88']
did he say what kind of neckline he's wearing?:::['7-23-89']
i've only met him once but i'm guessing, plunging?:::['7-23-91']
he is more of a "if you've got it, flaunt it" kind of father.:::['7-23-92']
i don't have anything but let me see if rachel does.:::['7-23-93']
yes, include more people in this.:::['7-23-94']
hey. do you realize that tomorrow we're gonna be getting married?:::['7-23-95']
i have a date tomorrow night.:::['7-23-96']
i can't believe we made it. you don't have to sound so surprised.:::['7-23-97']
i'm sorry, but...:::['7-23-98']
nothing. what?:::['7-23-99']
well, honestly? ever since we got engaged......i've waited for you to flip out.:::['7-23-100']
honestly? me too.:::['7-23-101']
i think that something stupid will come up and i'll......go all chandler.:::['7-23-103']
but nothing has. i'm so glad.:::['7-23-104']
thank you for staying so calm during this.:::['7-23-105']
it's made me stay calm.:::['7-23-106']
i could've been worse. okay.:::['7-23-107']
i'll be right there.:::['7-23-108', '7-8-78']
hi, if you're calling before saturday... ...you've reached monica and chandler.:::['7-23-109']
but if you're calling after saturday, you've reached mr. and mrs. bing.:::['7-23-110']
please leave a message for the bings!:::['7-23-111']
monica: maureen! hi.:::['7-23-112']
gosh. this is my cousin, maureen. we're the bings.:::['7-23-113']
hi! you guys look so beautiful.:::['7-23-114']
mr. and mrs. bing!:::['7-23-115']
wow, monica.:::['7-23-116']
so you know, i had my older-brother talk with chandler.:::['7-23-117']
what is that? well, i...:::['7-23-118']
i told him that if he ever hurt you......i would hunt him down:::['7-23-119']
and kick his ass.:::['7-23-120']
what is the matter with everybody? i'm serious.:::['7-23-121']
i would kick his ass!:::['7-23-122']
ross, please, my makeup!:::['7-23-123']
chandler. mom. thanks for wearing... something.:::['7-23-125']
ohh. this is so exciting! i thought we screwed you up too much for this.:::['7-23-126']
just think, soon there will be lots of little bings.:::['7-23-127']
i can't believe i have to go back to work after this and get spit on again.:::['7-23-128']
you're lucky. at least the people who spit on you are famous.:::['7-23-129']
who spits on you? i don't wanna talk about work.:::['7-23-130']
mrs. bing? these are my parents, judy and jack geller.:::['7-23-131']
it's lovely to meet you. are you his mother or father?:::['7-23-132']
jack!:::['7-23-133', '2-16-228']
what? i've never seen one before.:::['7-23-134']
dad, there's ross. go talk to him.:::['7-23-135']
i didn't even have a chance to act as if i'm okay with it.:::['7-23-136']
hello, all.:::['7-23-137']
hi... dad.:::['7-23-138']
hi, mr. bing.:::['7-23-139']
nora. charles.:::['7-23-140']
it's so great to see you both here. yes.:::['7-23-141']
although we may be seeing too much of some people.:::['7-23-142']
aren't you too old to wear a dress like that?:::['7-23-143']
don't you have too much penis to wear a dress like that?:::['7-23-144']
of course you can kick his ass, son.:::['7-23-146']
you could kick anyone's ass you want to.:::['7-23-147']
thanks, you guys.:::['7-23-148', '5-6-238']
rach, rach? yeah?:::['7-23-149']
do me a favor. talk to chandler's dad and keep him away from chandler's mom.:::['7-23-150']
yeah, but i don't know what he looks like. he is the man in a black dress.:::['7-23-151']
hi. i'm rachel, a friend of monica and chandler's.:::['7-23-152']
i'm amanda. oh, i get it.:::['7-23-153']
"a man, duh!":::['7-23-154']
could i have your attention?:::['7-23-155']
i'm ross geller. dr. ross geller.:::['7-23-156']
dad, please. as i was saying......i'm dr. ross geller.:::['7-23-157']
uh, and i'm the best man.:::['7-23-158']
and this marriage is doubly special for me......um, because not only is the groom:::['7-23-159']
my best friend......but, uh, the bride is my little sister.:::['7-23-160']
she's the greatest sister a guy could ask for.:::['7-23-161']
please join me in raising a glass......to the couple we're:::['7-23-162']
here to celebrate.:::['7-23-163']
to the bings. all: to the bings!:::['7-23-164']
i'm gonna steam my dress.:::['7-23-165']
who will make sure nothing happens to it?:::['7-23-166']
i'll do it. who wants it? anybody?:::['7-23-167']
i said i'll do it. nobody?:::['7-23-168']
all right, i'll do it myself. i'm not gonna screw it up.:::['7-23-169']
you're right. i'm sorry. you were a big help tonight.:::['7-23-170']
and thanks for putting my grandmother in the cab to get to the hotel.:::['7-23-171']
of course! that's what i'm here for. okay. sorry.:::['7-23-172']
ugh! pssh.:::['7-23-173']
what grandmother?:::['7-23-174']
where have you been? taking my parents to the hotel.:::['7-23-175']
going back to work? yeah.:::['7-23-176']
nice shades. if i wear these in my scenes......i won't get spit in my eyes.:::['7-23-177']
and, if i remember correctly, ray-ban was the official sponsor of wwi.:::['7-23-178']
great! all right!:::['7-23-179']
i'll see you later. all right.:::['7-23-180']
where's chandler? i think he's in rachel's room. see you.:::['7-23-181']
is monica here? she's steaming her dress. why?:::['7-23-184']
i think chandler's gone. what?:::['7-23-185']
he left that. "tell monica i'm sorry.":::['7-23-186']
"tell monica i'm sorry.":::['7-23-189']
tell her yourself.:::['7-23-190']
oh, my god. chandler just left, though?:::['7-23-191']
maybe it's not what we think. maybe it's::::['7-23-192']
"tell monica i'm sorry i drank the last of the milk.":::['7-23-193']
or maybe he was writing to tell her that he's changed his name::::['7-23-194']
"tell monica, i'm sorry.":::['7-23-195']
it means he freaked out and left! don't be so negative!:::['7-23-196']
good god, isn't it possible that "sorry" is sitting in there right now?:::['7-23-197']
phoebe, i think ross is right. what are we gonna do?:::['7-23-198']
i'm gonna have to go find him and bring him back.:::['7-23-199']
you make sure monica does not find out, okay?:::['7-23-200']
but, if you don't find him and bring him back......i am gonna hunt you down:::['7-23-201']
and kick your ass!:::['7-23-202']
i will find him.:::['7-23-203']
joey? can you go through these lines with me?:::['7-23-204']
oh, man, they just re-did my makeup.:::['7-23-205']
just the last two pages. all right.:::['7-23-206']
i found the picture!:::['7-23-207', '7-23-240']
picture? what picture?:::['7-23-208', '7-23-221']
the picture of my wife! i found it in your pack!:::['7-23-209']
could you lower the script? i don't want to.:::['7-23-210']
i need to see your face so i can play off your reaction.:::['7-23-211']
i know you're great and play all those shakespeare guys......but you're spitting:::['7-23-213']
all over me, man.:::['7-23-214']
of course i am! you know you've been spitting?:::['7-23-215']
that's what real actors do.:::['7-23-216']
enunciation is the mark of a good actor.:::['7-23-217']
and when you enunciate, you spit!:::['7-23-218']
wow. didn't know that.:::['7-23-219']
thanks. okay, check it out.:::['7-23-220']
have you seen chandler? no, i haven't seen him.:::['7-23-222']
damn. he's getting married tomorrow, right?:::['7-23-223']
yes. don't worry. everything's fine.:::['7-23-224']
see you at the wedding. i wasn't invited.:::['7-23-225']
then we'll see you the day after tomorrow.:::['7-23-226']
mom? dad?:::['7-23-227']
you kids talk about this place so much, we thought we'd see what the fuss is all about.:::['7-23-229']
i see why the girls like coming here. why?:::['7-23-230']
the sexy blond behind the counter.:::['7-23-231']
gunther? she just added him to her list.:::['7-23-232']
your list? of people we're allowed to sleep...:::['7-23-233']
i know what the list is.:::['7-23-234']
sit down, have a cup of joe.:::['7-23-235']
i can't, i'm sorry.:::['7-23-236']
if you see chandler, tell him i'm looking for him.:::['7-23-237']
and if you see rita moreno, let her know i'm looking for her.:::['7-23-238']
director: action!:::['7-23-239']
what picture?:::['7-23-241', '5-20-231']
a picture of my wife, in your pack!:::['7-23-242']
you went through my personal property?:::['7-23-243']
why do you have a picture of paulette in your pack?:::['7-23-244']
because, vincent, we were lovers......for two years!:::['7-23-245']
director: cut! wonderful!:::['7-23-246']
great scene, huh?:::['7-23-247']
you were awesome. in that last speech, you soaked me.:::['7-23-248']
tomorrow's call sheet. i'm not working tomorrow.:::['7-23-249']
you are now. no, you gotta get me out of it.:::['7-23-250']
i have plans. important plans!:::['7-23-251']
still no word from chandler. oh, man.:::['7-23-252']
but they found the grandmother wandering down 5th.:::['7-23-253']
okay, well there's one down.:::['7-23-254']
i'm getting married today!:::['7-23-255', '4-24-177', '4-24-180']
i cracked a rib, but i don't care. today's my wedding!:::['7-23-256']
my day is finally here!:::['7-23-257']
she might not even notice he's gone.:::['7-23-258']
i'm gonna start getting ready!:::['7-23-259']
we can't let her start getting ready. this is too awful!:::['7-23-260']
she'll be in the gown, and he won't show up.:::['7-23-261']
then she'll have to take off the gown...:::['7-23-262']
stop it. you can't do this here.:::['7-23-263']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.:::['7-23-264', '3-3-284', '3-7-320']
it's just so sad.:::['7-23-265']
pull it together. she can't see you like this.:::['7-23-266']
she'll know something's wrong. i know. i know.:::['7-23-267']
there's no tissue.:::['7-23-268']
can you grab me some toilet paper?:::['7-23-269']
oh, that's gone too. this is monica's bathroom, right?:::['7-23-270']
i found one. okay.:::['7-23-271']
can i have another one?:::['7-23-274']
do you need some floss?:::['7-23-276']
i can't imagine what will happen if he doesn't show up.:::['7-23-277']
here's a whole bunch.:::['7-23-278']
she'll be at the wedding waiting......and people will be whispering,"that poor girl.":::['7-23-279']
then she'll have to come back here and live alone.:::['7-23-280']
there was a pregnancy test in the garbage, and it's positive.:::['7-23-282']
monica's pregnant.:::['7-23-283', '7-24-207']
so i guess she won't be totally alone.:::['7-23-284']
narrator: next time on friends::::['7-23-285']
we've gotta tell her that he's gone. no, we can't.:::['7-23-286']
she's gonna start getting ready soon.:::['7-23-287']
can't you stall her a little?:::['7-23-288']
i'm never gonna get married.:::['7-23-289', '7-24-34']
we've just got one short scene. it's just you and richard, and he's a pro.:::['7-23-290']
are you drunk? no!:::['7-23-291']
yes, you are! all right.:::['7-23-292']
how's chandler? great!:::['7-23-293']
where are you? on the set.:::['7-23-294']
this is turning into the worst wedding day ever.:::['7-23-295']
i saw the porsche parked out front.:::['7-22-1']
can i get the keys? i'll take that bad boy for a spin.:::['7-22-2']
ross drives it? when i ask, you say you're the only one allowed to.:::['7-22-3']
he's my brother, plus he drives so slow he couldn't hurt it.:::['7-22-4']
it's a car, monica, not a rocket ship.:::['7-22-5']
whatever, ross.:::['7-22-6']
just replace the bulbs in the brake lights after you're done.:::['7-22-7']
hey. ross: hi.:::['7-22-8']
saw the porsche. looking good. when can i take it out again?:::['7-22-9']
you let joey drive it? i've never driven it. not once.:::['7-22-10']
okay, once. okay, i drive it all the time.:::['7-22-11']
so much for the "you can drive it but don't tell rachel" plan.:::['7-22-12']
wow, i can't believe you lied to me.:::['7-22-13']
i can fix this. monica, rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding.:::['7-22-14']
i won't let you drive the porsche because you're a terrible driver.:::['7-22-15']
there. that wasn't about the wedding.:::['7-22-16']
if you want a ride in the porsche, i'll take you around the block.:::['7-22-17']
you got a couple hours?:::['7-22-18']
whew, that was a brisk ride.:::['7-22-19']
take the top down, did you? only way to fly.:::['7-22-20']
give me the keys. monica's wrong. i'm an excellent driver.:::['7-22-21']
you're fast and irresponsible. that adds up to a bad driver.:::['7-22-22']
in high school, that added up to head cheerleader.:::['7-22-23']
did you see the look that girl just gave me, huh?:::['7-22-24']
she must've seen me cruising in the bad boy.:::['7-22-25']
she's checking out your beehive. what?:::['7-22-26']
give me a brush. give me the keys.:::['7-22-27']
no way! well, no brush.:::['7-22-28']
fine. it doesn't matter.:::['7-22-29']
if i remember correctly, there's a comb on the floor of the bathroom.:::['7-22-30']
alimony.:::['7-22-31']
we still haven't gotten an rsvp from your dad.:::['7-22-32']
oh, right. um, maybe that's because i didn't send him an invitation.:::['7-22-33']
chandler, he's your father. he should be at your wedding.:::['7-22-34']
i don't even know him. i haven't seen him in years.:::['7-22-35']
and when he finds out he wasn't asked?:::['7-22-36']
we don't run in the same circles.:::['7-22-37']
i hang out with you guys and he......stars in a drag show in vegas.:::['7-22-38']
ooh, i think i want to trade circles.:::['7-22-39']
you don't want him there. nobody will stare at the bride......when the groom's father's:::['7-22-40']
wearing a backless dress.:::['7-22-41']
heh, so what?:::['7-22-42']
as long as he's not wearing a white dress and a veil, i don't care.:::['7-22-43']
i think i need to do some shopping.:::['7-22-44']
ooh, nice.:::['7-22-46']
what do you think you're doing? just washing the windshield.:::['7-22-48']
there's no way i'll let you drive this car.:::['7-22-49']
just hand over the keys. oh.:::['7-22-50']
oh, ah-ah-ah!:::['7-22-51']
do not start this car.:::['7-22-52']
okay, okay. i will give you 20 bucks......if you get out of this car right now. hey!:::['7-22-53']
look.:::['7-22-54', '2-20-133', '3-20-286']
if you're so freaked out, get in the car.:::['7-22-55']
with you? yeah, right.:::['7-22-56']
what are you doing? get in front. in the death seat?:::['7-22-59']
hey, guys. hi, sweetie.:::['7-22-60']
ready to go? my purse is at mon's. i'll be back.:::['7-22-61']
wait a minute. what?:::['7-22-62']
oops.:::['7-22-65', '5-20-35', '4-13-180']
whoa, oh, that one kept going.:::['7-22-66']
so, you and phoebe, huh?:::['7-22-67']
how long have you been going out? a month.:::['7-22-68']
wow. we ought to get to know each other better.:::['7-22-69']
sure. i'd like that. yeah. so, uh...:::['7-22-70']
what's your name?:::['7-22-71', '7-22-232', '5-13-127']
it's jake. joey.:::['7-22-72']
do you like the knicks? yeah, big fan.:::['7-22-73']
me too. there's a game tuesday. do you want to go?:::['7-22-74']
great! let me make sure i'm not doing anything tuesday.:::['7-22-75']
what's this? your suitcase. we're going to vegas.:::['7-22-77']
are you serious? eloping? no more stupid wedding stuff.:::['7-22-78']
no more these flowers, these flowers. think of the money we'll save.:::['7-22-79']
we're not eloping. i love the flowers. can our wedding be bigger, please?:::['7-22-80']
we're going to see your dad.:::['7-22-81']
i want to get to know my father-in-law.:::['7-22-82']
we already went over this and i won.:::['7-22-83']
no, you didn't. honey, just so you know...:::['7-22-84']
now that you're marrying me, you don't get to win anymore.:::['7-22-85']
forget it. i don't want to go. i don't want to see him.:::['7-22-86']
i know your dad embarrassed you.:::['7-22-87']
all kids are embarrassed by their parents.:::['7-22-88']
you need a new word for what i went through.:::['7-22-89']
in high school, he came to all my swim meets......dressed as a hollywood starlet.:::['7-22-90']
it's hard enough to be 14.:::['7-22-91']
you're skinny, wearing speedos your mom promised you'd grow into.:::['7-22-92']
you look up in the stands. there's your dad cheering you on.:::['7-22-93']
dressed as carmen miranda, wearing a headdress with real fruit......that he'll later give to your friends:::['7-22-94']
as a healthy snack.:::['7-22-95']
the point is that he was at every one of your swim meets cheering you on.:::['7-22-96']
that's a pretty great dad.:::['7-22-97']
he had sex with mr. garibaldi.:::['7-22-98']
who's mr. garibaldi? does it matter?:::['7-22-99']
chandler...:::['7-22-100']
you're not 14 anymore, okay? maybe it's time you let that stuff go.:::['7-22-101']
if he's not at your wedding, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.:::['7-22-102']
okay, but i'm just doing this for you.:::['7-22-103']
i never get to win anymore? how much did you ever win before?:::['7-22-105']
pheebs. hey.:::['7-22-106']
you know how, uh, when you're wearing pants and you lean forward......i check out your underwear?:::['7-22-107']
well, when jake did it... mm-hm.:::['7-22-109']
...i saw that he was wearing women's underwear.:::['7-22-110']
i know. they were mine.:::['7-22-111']
no, no, wait. that's weird.:::['7-22-113']
we were goofing around, and i dared him to try them on.:::['7-22-114']
that's weird!:::['7-22-115']
i'm wearing his briefs right now. that's kind of hot.:::['7-22-116']
i think so too. and that little flap? great for holding my lipstick.:::['7-22-117']
i wouldn't know about that.:::['7-22-118']
jake says that women's underwear is actually more comfortable.:::['7-22-119']
he loves how silk feels against his skin.:::['7-22-120']
next he'll say your high heels are good for his posture.:::['7-22-121']
there's nothing wrong with jake. he is all man.:::['7-22-122']
i think, more than you.:::['7-22-123']
he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink lacies.:::['7-22-124']
only a man completely secure with his masculinity......could walk around in women's underwear.:::['7-22-125']
i don't think you could.:::['7-22-126']
i am secure with my masculinity. okay, whatever.:::['7-22-127']

he even came to new york. i said i was too busy.:::['7-22-156']

how much of a man am i?:::['7-22-220']
wow, nice. manly, and also kind of a slut.:::['7-22-221']
you know, i'm beginning to see what jake was talking about.:::['7-22-222']
uh-huh. the silk feels really good.:::['7-22-223']
and things aren't as smashed down as i thought they would be.:::['7-22-224']
you have so many more choices than with men's underwear.:::['7-22-226']
bikini, french cut, thong. and the fabrics: cotton, silk, lace.:::['7-22-227']
you know what i've always wondered about? pantyhose!:::['7-22-228']
the way they start at your toe, then they go all the way up to...:::['7-22-229']
i should go take these off. i think it's important you do.:::['7-22-230']
what an unusual name.:::['7-22-235']
you must have had terribly fascinating parents.:::['7-22-236']
oh, they're a hoot.:::['7-22-237']
and who is your friend?:::['7-22-238']
i'm monica.:::['7-22-239', '5-9-334']
monica. where are you from? new york.:::['7-22-240']
i'm not very fond of new york.:::['7-22-241']
queens, i like.:::['7-22-242']
ooh, what is this......sparkling something, honey, huh?:::['7-22-243']
actually, monica and i are engaged.:::['7-22-244']
when's the big day?:::['7-22-247']
in two weeks.:::['7-22-248']
well, i wish you both a lifetime of happiness.:::['7-22-250']
so you're bald.:::['7-22-251']
wait, wait.:::['7-22-252', '7-9-49', '4-22-23']
we'd really love it if you could be there.:::['7-22-253']
i know it would make me happy......ma'am.:::['7-22-255']
then i wouldn't miss it for the world.:::['7-22-256']
oh, i'm getting all misty here. ha!:::['7-22-257']
you'd think i was having my legs waxed or something.:::['7-22-258']
thanks for making me do this.:::['7-22-260']
before we go on with the show, i want to say to the bride and groom......how lucky they are to have:::['7-22-261']
found each other.:::['7-22-262']
in every life a little rain must fall.:::['7-22-263']
fortunately......in my life...:::['7-22-264']
it's raining men:::['7-22-265']
chorus: hallelujah:::['7-22-266']
it's raining men, uh-huh amen:::['7-22-267']
when i was growing up, i played the one on the far left.:::['7-22-268']
chorus: and it's raining men, amen:::['7-22-269']
remind me to introduce you to someone.:::['7-22-270']
who? fourth gear.:::['7-22-271']
what does he want? i wasn't doing anything.:::['7-22-273']
maybe he saw your hands slip briefly from the 10 and 2:00 position.:::['7-22-274']
maybe it's, uh, sergeant sagittarius coming back to flirt some more.:::['7-22-275']
it's a different guy.:::['7-22-276']
good evening, officer. do you know how fast you were going?:::['7-22-277']
uh, no, i don't, but it could not have been more than 60.:::['7-22-278']
you're right. it was 37.:::['7-22-279']
you're not ticketing me for driving too slow, are you?:::['7-22-280']
you know, officer, i, uh...:::['7-22-282']
i had the weirdest dream last night.:::['7-22-283']
your license, please.:::['7-22-285']
you don't want to hear about my dream......officer......pretty?:::['7-22-286']
it's petty.:::['7-22-287']
i'll be right back with your ticket.:::['7-22-288']
you have a son. i know. i know.:::['7-22-289']
feel better? yeah. much. heh.:::['7-22-290']
not that i'm insecure about my manhood or anything, but, uh......i need to hook up with:::['7-22-292']
a woman right now.:::['7-22-293']
i understand. yeah, okay.:::['7-22-294']
hey. hi. hi.:::['7-22-295']
you look familiar. do i know you?:::['7-22-296']
maybe it's because i'm on television.:::['7-22-298']
i'm an actor on days ofour lives. wow. really?:::['7-22-299']
four-fifty, please. oh, let me get this.:::['7-22-300']
these are for you.:::['7-22-301']
oh, hey! how was your audition? hey.:::['7-19-0']
i'm sorry, do i know you?:::['7-19-1']
practicing blowing you off. i'm gonna be a big movie star!:::['7-19-3']
oh, you got it?:::['7-19-4']
not yet, but the audition went great! what's it for?:::['7-19-5']
a big-budget period movie about three italian brothers......who come to america at the turn:::['7-19-6']
of the century. it's classy.:::['7-19-7']
the director's supposed to be the next-next martin scorsese.:::['7-19-8']
the "next-next"?:::['7-19-9']
a guy from chicago's supposed to be the next martin scorsese.:::['7-19-10']
this guy's right after him.:::['7-19-11']
joey, it's estelle. i just talked to the casting people. they loved you!:::['7-19-13']
they loved me!:::['7-19-14']
they want to see you again tomorrow.:::['7-19-15']
do you have a problem with full-frontal nudity?:::['7-19-17']
are you kidding me? i never rent a movie without it!:::['7-19-18']
uh, okay, let me call you back.:::['7-19-20']
what's the matter? they want me naked in the movie.:::['7-19-21']
wow. joey: i know.:::['7-19-22']
my grandmother's gonna see this. grandma's gonna have to get in line.:::['7-19-23']
the wedding's so close. are you nervous?:::['7-19-24']
yeah, but i also can't wait till it's over.:::['7-19-25']
we have a pact not to have sex again until the wedding.:::['7-19-26']
a "no sex" pact, huh?:::['7-19-27']
i have one of those with every woman in america.:::['7-19-28']
will you give me a hand making up the guest bedroom?:::['7-19-29']
cousin cassie's staying with us for a few days.:::['7-19-30']
cassie? i haven't seen her in, like, forever.:::['7-19-31']
i wonder if she still carries a barbie everywhere?:::['7-19-32']
she's 25 years old. so? i still...:::['7-19-33']
you're probably right.:::['7-19-34', '10-14-236']
hi. monica & phoebe: hey.:::['7-19-35']
pheebs, can i talk to you over here for a second?:::['7-19-36']
phoebe: yeah. subtle, guys.:::['7-19-37']
i know you're planning my surprise bridal shower.:::['7-19-39']
ha, okay, well, don't ruin it.just play along, at least.:::['7-19-40']
okay. sorry. rachel: okay.:::['7-19-41']
oh, my god. we have to throw her a shower?:::['7-19-42']
what'd you decide to do about the movie?:::['7-19-43']
it's not like it's porn. this is a serious, legitimate movie.:::['7-19-45']
nudity's really important to the story.:::['7-19-46']
that's what you say about porn.:::['7-19-47']
maybe i shouldn't go on the callback.:::['7-19-48']
no, you should. a lot of major actors do nude scenes.:::['7-19-49']
the chance to star in a movie? come on!:::['7-19-50']
that's true. and i'm only naked in one scene. it sounds really great.:::['7-19-51']
my character's catholic. he falls in love with a jewish girl.:::['7-19-52']
we run away and get caught in a big rainstorm.:::['7-19-53']
we go into a barn, undress each other and hold each other.:::['7-19-54']
it's really sweet and tender.:::['7-19-55']
plus, everyone is gonna see your thing.:::['7-19-56']
when can we have this shower?:::['7-19-57']
she has so much going on, we have only two options.:::['7-19-58']
we have friday. that's just two days away.:::['7-19-59']
what is the other option? yesterday.:::['7-19-60']
well, if we make it yesterday, woo-hoo, we're done.:::['7-19-61']
it's impossible. we can't do this by friday.:::['7-19-62']
we have to find a place, invite people, get food.:::['7-19-63']
there's too much to do.:::['7-19-64']
we cannot do it! calm down!:::['7-19-65']
okay. i'm sorry, you're right. i'm sorry.:::['7-19-66']
just calm down, woman!:::['7-19-67']
phoebe, i already did.:::['7-19-68']
all right, then i need to calm down. okay.:::['7-19-69']
i think we can do this if we just get organized.:::['7-19-70']
uh-huh. we have two days to plan this party. we just need to make fast decisions. mm-hm.:::['7-19-71']
where will we have it?:::['7-19-72']
um, here. what time? four o'clock. food?:::['7-19-73']
finger sandwiches and tea. ooh, great. very monica.:::['7-19-74']
and chili. ah, you went one too far.:::['7-19-75']
uh, flowers or balloons? both.:::['7-19-76']
we're paying for this. okay. neither.:::['7-19-77']
um, what should we do for the theme? "lusts of the flesh.":::['7-19-78']
what? i don't know. cowboy theme?:::['7-19-79']
i'm glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding.:::['7-19-81']
oh, boy. me too.:::['7-19-82']
you know, i was thinking, if we had a big fight... mm-hm. ...and, uh, we broke up for a few hours.:::['7-19-83']
yeah. technically, we could have sex again.:::['7-19-84']
what do you think, bossy and domineering?:::['7-19-85']
the wedding's off, sloppy and immature.:::['7-19-86']
that's me. come on. okay.:::['7-19-87']
wait. cassie's in the guest room. we're going to lunch.:::['7-19-88']
get rid of her, obsessive and shrill!:::['7-19-89']
shrill? the wedding is back on.:::['7-19-90']
i thought i heard voices. you must be chandler.:::['7-19-91']
hi. nice to meet you. nice to meet you too.:::['7-19-92']
so, ready to go? yeah.:::['7-19-93']
chandler? i'll be right with you.:::['7-19-94']
cassie needs to stay at your place. why?:::['7-19-95']
because "pervie perverson" here can't stop staring at her.:::['7-19-96']
chandler, she's our cousin!:::['7-19-97']
i wasn't staring. i was listening intently.:::['7-19-98']
it's called being a good conversationalist. watch.:::['7-19-99']
say something.:::['7-19-100']
you were staring about eight inches south of there.:::['7-19-101']
fine. she can stay at my place.:::['7-19-102']
what does cassie look like now?:::['7-19-103']
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn. ross: huh.:::['7-19-104']
so this aunt marilyn, is she coming to the wedding?:::['7-19-105']
wafer-thin ice.:::['7-19-106']
hey, i'm back.:::['7-19-107']
uh, so, will i be reading the same scene again?:::['7-19-109']
i tried to call you. you didn't need to come today.:::['7-19-110']
i'd have been perfect for this part.:::['7-19-112']
you made a bad decision and ruined your movie. good day!:::['7-19-113']
you didn't need to come, because the director saw your tape and loved it.:::['7-19-114']
and scene.:::['7-19-115']
huh? wasn't that fun? we did a little improv there. yeah!:::['7-19-116']
so, you... you were saying?:::['7-19-117']
the director wants to meet you tomorrow.:::['7-19-118']
wow. sure. that's great.:::['7-19-119']
your agent said you're okay with nudity.:::['7-19-120']
yeah, sure. as long as it's handled tastefully.:::['7-19-121']
and that barn is not too cold.:::['7-19-122']
terrific. well, uh, there's one more thing.:::['7-19-123']
uh... uh, it's important to the director that everything in the movie is authentic.:::['7-19-124']
in your love scene with sarah......she talks about how she's never:::['7-19-125']
seen a naked man who wasn't jewish.:::['7-19-126']
so, what?:::['7-19-128']
so, uh, well, the director is insisting that whoever play that part......be authentically, uh, anatomically......not jewish.:::['7-19-129']
you know what i'm saying?:::['7-19-130']
no. what?:::['7-19-132']
an italian catholic immigrant at this time would not be...:::['7-19-133']
bar mitzvah-ed?:::['7-19-134']
to get this part, you can't be... no.:::['7-19-135']
but you are? yep.:::['7-19-136']
you told them you weren't? that's right.:::['7-19-137']
it's definitely all gone? there's nothing there to work with?:::['7-19-139']
what were you thinking? i don't know. i just want this part.:::['7-19-140']
they say no matter what you're asked during an audition, say yes.:::['7-19-141']
they want you to ride a horse, say you can.:::['7-19-142']
you figure out how to do it later.:::['7-19-143']
this is not like learning to ride a horse. this is like learning to......grow a turtleneck.:::['7-19-144']
i know, okay? tomorrow, when i go meet the director......i have to take my clothes off so:::['7-19-145']
they can see what my body looks like.:::['7-19-146']
oh, my god. what are you gonna do?:::['7-19-147']
i have to call my agent and tell her i can't do the part.:::['7-19-148']
this may sound crazy, but there may be something we could......fashion.:::['7-19-151']
like what? well, i'm not sure yet, but, um......off the top of my head,i'm thinking......double-sided tape:::['7-19-152']
and some sort of luncheon meat.:::['7-19-153']
i've got a great idea for party favors for the shower.:::['7-19-154']
we get mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them.:::['7-19-155']
then inside is each person's individual birthstone.:::['7-19-156']
all right, you take care of that. okay.:::['7-19-158']
meanwhile, the party's tomorrow and we don't have a guest list.:::['7-19-159']
okay. who do we know that's coming? me. are you?:::['7-19-160']
hey. hey, what's up?:::['7-19-161', '7-4-188']
i'm making something for joey. can i raid your fridge?:::['7-19-162']
have at it.:::['7-19-163']
all right. turkey? mm, that won't work.:::['7-19-164']
cheese? that won't work.:::['7-19-165']
olive loaf? i hope that won't work.:::['7-19-166']
are you making him a sandwich?:::['7-19-167']
no, it's, um, more like a wrap.:::['7-19-168']
okay, so, um, i'm gonna go, guys.:::['7-19-169']
so you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!:::['7-19-170']
we have to get her a present?:::['7-19-171']
okay, but look. look at what i got.:::['7-19-172']
it's her address book. we have a guest list.:::['7-19-173']
you're amazing. did you pull that out of her purse?:::['7-19-175']
uh-huh. and a little seed money for the party.:::['7-19-176']
oh, nice.:::['7-19-177']
cassie?:::['7-19-178']
hey, ross.:::['7-19-179', '5-16-244', '3-14-74']
it's been so long!:::['7-19-180']
last time i saw you......you were setting up your tent:::['7-19-181']
in line for return of the jedi.:::['7-19-182']
oh, uh, that's right.:::['7-19-183']
so you did see me that day. because it seemed like you didn't.:::['7-19-184']
yeah, sorry about that. it's okay. come on in.:::['7-19-185']
thanks for letting me stay here. monica's place was nice.:::['7-19-186']
but her fiancé sure stares a lot.:::['7-19-187']
oh, my god! you do a great chandler!:::['7-19-189']
yeah, i have a knack for impressions.:::['7-19-191']
well, maybe after we get re-acquainted, uh, you could do me.:::['7-19-192']
yeah. no!:::['7-19-193']
cassie, how you...? how you doing on that......hot dog?:::['7-19-194']
i'm all done. thank god.:::['7-19-195']
the last time we hung out was when our parents rented that beach house.:::['7-19-196']
oh, right, right. ooh, remember the time... ...l, uh, pinned you down and tickled you until you cried?:::['7-19-197']
we're probably too old to do that now.:::['7-19-198']
i'll always remember that summer. it's when i got all these freckles.:::['7-19-199']
and... and i'll always remember that summer......because that's when i realized:::['7-19-201']
that we are related.:::['7-19-202']
it took you that long to figure it out, huh?:::['7-19-203']
um, i'm a little slow.:::['7-19-204']
just as our children would be.:::['7-19-205']
hi. woman 1: hi.:::['7-19-206']
how are you? good. hi. thanks for coming.:::['7-19-207']
woman 2: oh, thank you. thank you. so nice to see you.:::['7-19-208']
woman 3: no, thanks. okay. hey, rach?:::['7-19-209']
yeah? who the hell are all these people?:::['7-19-210']
i don't know. i called everybody in her book.:::['7-19-211']
these are the ones that could show up on 24 hours' notice.:::['7-19-212']
there's a word for people like that: losers.:::['7-19-213']
hi, i'm rachel. this is phoebe. i'm the maid of honor.:::['7-19-214']
how do you know monica? i was her accountant four years ago. oh...:::['7-19-215']
i'm interested to find out who's been doing her taxes the last four years.:::['7-19-216']
when is monica supposed to get here? rachel & phoebe: i don't know.:::['7-19-218']
you didn't tell her? you were supposed to.:::['7-19-220']
you were supposed to tell her to come! i was bringing the cake!:::['7-19-221']
fine, i'll go call her. and please tell her to bring a cake!:::['7-19-222']
we have a lot of options. a number of prototypes for you to try on.:::['7-19-223']
wow, those look great.:::['7-19-224']
okay, this one's a mushroom cap. uh, this one is made of bologna.:::['7-19-225']
and... and the toothpicks? just until the glue dries.:::['7-19-226']
these are more realistic, but perishable.:::['7-19-228']
over here, we have pink suede, which is nice.:::['7-19-229']
but if it gets wet, it'll shrink.:::['7-19-230']
maybe we'll just take that one away.:::['7-19-231']
i also did a little something in fur, but, uh, that's really just for me.:::['7-19-232']
why don't you try these on? we'll get a better idea of what works.:::['7-19-233']
thanks, you are such a good friend. and this is so weird.:::['7-19-234']
joey: ow.:::['7-19-235']
toothpick? joey: yeah.:::['7-19-236']
what are you trying now? joey: the fruit roll-up.:::['7-19-237']
and? joey: delicious.:::['7-19-238']
joey: wait a minute. wait a minute. we have a winner!:::['7-19-240']
what? which one?:::['7-19-241']
the silly putty. not so silly anymore!:::['7-19-242']
ross: she's your cousin. she's your cousin.:::['7-19-243']
if she knew what was going on in your head, she'd think you were sick.:::['7-19-244']
or would she? let's back up for a second.:::['7-19-245']
she was the one who suggested opening a bottle of wine.:::['7-19-246']
she was the one who turned down the lights.:::['7-19-247']
she was the one that wanted to rent logan's run......the sexiest movie ever.:::['7-19-248']
i know that look.:::['7-19-249']
forget it. i want it. she wants it.:::['7-19-250']
i'm going in.:::['7-19-251']
ross: say something clever.:::['7-19-253']
okay, doesn't have to be clever.:::['7-19-254']
just has to be words. say some words.:::['7-19-255']
any words will do.:::['7-19-256']
oh, my god, this is the longest......that anyone has not talked ever!:::['7-19-257']
there is nothing you could say to make this worse......so just say something!:::['7-19-258']
i haven't had sex in a very long time.:::['7-19-259']
ross: yeah, you really shouldn't have said anything.:::['7-19-260']
phoebe? rachel? it's monica.:::['7-19-261']
i wonder what you could possibly need me for on such short notice?:::['7-19-262']
oh, monica. we are so sorry. for what?:::['7-19-264']
first, for forgetting to throw you a bridal shower.:::['7-19-265']
then, forgetting to invite you to it.:::['7-19-266']
you already had it?:::['7-19-267']
we called everyone in your phone book. a bunch of people came.:::['7-19-268']
it took us so long to get you here that they had to leave.:::['7-19-269']
we wanted to throw you a big surprise and a great shower.:::['7-19-270']
now you don't have either.:::['7-19-271']
we ruined everything. ugh.:::['7-19-272']
no, wait a minute, that's not true. what you did was really sweet.:::['7-19-273']
it kind of works out for the best, heh. what do you mean?:::['7-19-274']
now i get to spend my shower with the only people i really love.:::['7-19-275']
i get all those presents without talking to people i don't even like!:::['7-19-276']
surprise. surprise, monica.:::['7-19-277']
what's cool is, the character is from naples, right?:::['7-19-278']
director: yeah. my whole family's from naples.:::['7-19-279']
that's great. okay. i've heard everything i need to hear...:::['7-19-280']
we just need to, uh...:::['7-19-281']
leslie?:::['7-19-282']
uh, joey, this is the awkward part. oh, hey, right. not a problem.:::['7-19-283']
i totally understand you need to......make sure i don't have any:::['7-19-284']
horrible scars or tattoos.:::['7-19-285']
don't you worry.:::['7-19-286']
i have nothing to hide.:::['7-19-287']
so, there you go. that's me.:::['7-19-288']
one hundred-percent natural.:::['7-19-289']
i tell you, that has never happened before.:::['7-19-290']
cassie, are you finding everything okay?:::['7-19-291']
cassie: yeah. thank you so much for letting me stay here.:::['7-19-292']
oh, it's no problem. i've...:::['7-19-293']
phoebe: say something. say anything.:::['7-19-295']
ask her out! she's not your cousin!:::['7-19-296']
hey, hey! guys, you won't believe this!:::['7-18-0']
i just got off the phone with my agent... oh, my god!:::['7-18-1']
i'm sorry. too soon. you go. joey: okay.:::['7-18-2']
i got nominated for my part on days of our lives!:::['7-18-3']
phoebe: oh, joey, good for you! monica: congratulations!:::['7-18-4']
i can't believe you're nominated for an emmy! no, no.:::['7-18-5']
soap opera digest award? nope, i'm up for a "soapie.":::['7-18-6']
honey, is that something you're making up?:::['7-18-7']
no, no, no, it's real! and it has been since 1998.:::['7-18-8']
hey, rach, rach. i'm up for a soapie!:::['7-18-9']
oh, my god! that is the third most prestigious soap opera award there is!:::['7-18-11']
thank you! well, i guess now we know who i'm taking to the awards.:::['7-18-12']
oh, stop that! don't kid about that! will all the stars be there?:::['7-18-13']
many are scheduled to appear.:::['7-18-14']
oh, my god. i can't go. i'll be too nervous! okay, i'll go.:::['7-18-16']
no! you are getting married. this is all i have.:::['7-18-17']
and ernest muhlbrat first hypothesized that the velociraptor, when threatened......would expand its collar:::['7-18-18']
and emit a high-pitched noise......to frighten off its predator.:::['7-18-19']
yes, mr. lewis?:::['7-18-20']
what kind of noise?:::['7-18-21']
just a high-pitched, intimidating noise.:::['7-18-22']
but like how?:::['7-18-23']
well, we... we don't know for sure.:::['7-18-24']
but in my head, it sounded something like this, uh::::['7-18-25']
of course, this is just conjecture.:::['7-18-26']
ahem, okay. that's, uh... that's all for today.:::['7-18-27']
mr. morse, can i see you for a moment?:::['7-18-28']
yes, sir?:::['7-18-29']
mr. morse, i need to talk to you about your midterm exam.:::['7-18-30']
i'm afraid i had to fail you. why?:::['7-18-31']
well, you need 60 percent to pass.:::['7-18-32']
what'd i get? seven.:::['7-18-33']
that's not so good.:::['7-18-34']
no, no, it's not. what happened there, ned?:::['7-18-35']
well, maybe you can cut me some slack.i'm sort of in love.:::['7-18-36']
i'm sorry, but that's really not my problem.:::['7-18-37']
i'm in love with you.:::['7-18-38']
well, that brings me in the loop a little.:::['7-18-39']
see, that's why i did so bad on this test. i'm having a hard time concentrating.:::['7-18-40']
when you're up there and you're teaching......and your face gets all serious......you look so good. when you wear:::['7-18-41']
that tight little turtleneck sweater...:::['7-18-42']
okay. ned, um...:::['7-18-43']
i, uh... ha, ha. i'm your teacher. i'm sorry.:::['7-18-44']
you're... you're a student.:::['7-18-45']
and i... and i like women, ha, ha.:::['7-18-46']
in spite of what may be written on the backs of some of these chairs.:::['7-18-47']
oh, my god. that guy at the counter is totally checking you out.:::['7-18-48']
oh, my god, he's really cute. heh. go for it.:::['7-18-50']
phoebe, i'm engaged.:::['7-18-51']
i'm just saying, get his number, just in case.:::['7-18-52']
but if chandler is in an accident and can't perform sexually, you know......then he would want you to take a lover:::['7-18-53']
to satisfy the needs he can no longer fulfill.:::['7-18-54']
hi. i... oh.:::['7-18-55']
can i just tell you something? um...:::['7-18-56']
i'm very flattered, but, uh, i'm engaged. ha, ha.:::['7-18-57']
wow, uh... this is kind of embarrassing.:::['7-18-58']
i was actually coming over to talk to your friend.:::['7-18-59']
well, you should be embarrassed.:::['7-18-60']
i thought you knew i was looking at you. i did, but that was really fun.:::['7-18-61']
"the winner is joey tribbiani!":::['7-18-62']
"oh, wow.:::['7-18-63']
i honestly never expected this. i, uh...:::['7-18-64']
i didn't prepare a speech.:::['7-18-65']
but i'd like to thank my parents, who've always been there for me.:::['7-18-66']
also like to thank my friends, chandler, monica, phoebe, rachel...":::['7-18-67']
i'm fourth? jeez!:::['7-18-68']
look at you with your little maple syrup award!:::['7-18-69']
maybe you don't tell anyone about this.:::['7-18-70']
what? no.:::['7-18-71', '7-5-129', '5-14-326']
it's not a big deal. i do that too, with my shampoo bottle.:::['7-18-72']
what award are you practicing for? grammy.:::['7-18-74']
best new artist. ooh.:::['7-18-75']
oh, hey, listen. the soapies people called today. i also get to present an award.:::['7-18-76']
aw, that's great. yeah.:::['7-18-77']
so you'll get on stage even if you don't win.:::['7-18-78']
you... you don't think i'm gonna win? of course i do.:::['7-18-79']
but, you know, favorite returning character is a tough category, joey.:::['7-18-81']
i mean, you're up against the guy who survived his own cremation.:::['7-18-82']
yeah. no, i know i might not win. but it's just...:::['7-18-83']
i've never even been nominated before. i want it so much.:::['7-18-84']
well, and you'll probably get it.:::['7-18-85']
but you should probably start practicing your "gracious-loser" face.:::['7-18-86']
like, when the cameras are on you and you wanna look disappointed......but also that your colleague:::['7-18-87']
deserved to win. sort of like::::['7-18-88']
hey. you know?:::['7-18-89']
you practice losing at the grammys too? oh, no, at the grammys, i always win.:::['7-18-90']
oh, hey. hey. how'd your date go with jake?:::['7-18-92']
great. we couldn't keep our eyes off each other all night.:::['7-18-93']
then every once in a while, he'd lean over and stroke my hair, and then touch my neck.:::['7-18-94']
okay, stop it. you're getting me all tingly.:::['7-18-95']
all i could think of was, "is he gonna kiss me? is he?":::['7-18-96']
and did he? i'm a lady, monica. i don't kiss and tell.:::['7-18-97']
but this hickey speaks for itself.:::['7-18-98']
okay, okay, i got it. i got it.:::['7-18-99']
i just like him so much that i just feel like i've had 10 drinks today.:::['7-18-100']
and i've only had six.:::['7-18-101']
oh. you know, i haven't had that feeling since i first starting going out with chandler.:::['7-18-102']
wow, i'm never gonna have that feeling again. you sound like a guy.:::['7-18-103']
heh. no, a guy would say, "i'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else." heh.:::['7-18-104']
oh, my god. i'm never gonna sleep with anyone else!:::['7-18-105']
i've been so busy planning the wedding, i forgot about all the things i'd be giving up.:::['7-18-106']
i mean, i'm never gonna have a first kiss again.:::['7-18-107']
you'll have a last kiss.:::['7-18-108']
can i ask you something? you ever had a guy have a crush on you?:::['7-18-109']
is that why you wanted to tie my tie?:::['7-18-110']
there's this kid in my class who said he's in love with me.:::['7-18-111']
whoa! ross: yeah.:::['7-18-112']
whoa, what? ross has a boyfriend.:::['7-18-113']
i do... i do not have a boyfriend.:::['7-18-114']
there's a guy in one of my classes who has a crush on me.:::['7-18-115']
really? yeah. i don't know.:::['7-18-116']
i mean, last year, elizabeth, now this kid...:::['7-18-117']
what... what... what is it? am i giving out some kind of......a sexy-professor vibe?:::['7-18-118']
not right now.:::['7-18-119', '3-6-127']
the point is, my natural charisma has made him fail his midterm.:::['7-18-120']
aw, see now i feel bad for the kid.:::['7-18-121']
i had a crush on a teacher once, and it was so hard, you know.:::['7-18-122']
i couldn't concentrate and i blushed every time he looked at me.:::['7-18-123']
come on, you remember what it's like to be 19 and in love.:::['7-18-124']
yeah, guess i can cut him some slack. rachel: yeah.:::['7-18-125']
how'd you get over that teacher? i didn't. i got under him.:::['7-18-126']
problem solved.:::['7-18-127']
bye, phoebe. okay, bye.:::['7-18-128']
all right. bye. bye.:::['7-18-129']
we said goodbye at the door so as not to flaunt our new love.:::['7-18-130']
phoebe, it's okay. you don't have to tiptoe around me.:::['7-18-131']
i've been thinking about it, and um... you know what?:::['7-18-132']
i'm okay about not having that new-relationship feeling.:::['7-18-133']
i miss you already! i miss you too!:::['7-18-134']
see, that's what i mean. that's great, but i wouldn't trade in what i have for that.:::['7-18-135']
i mean, i'm gonna be with chandler for the rest of my life. that's what makes me happy. mm-hm.:::['7-18-136']
hey, sweetie, come here, sit down. we were talking about how our relationship is......deep and meaningful.:::['7-18-137']
it really is, don't you think?:::['7-18-138']
oh, totally.:::['7-18-139']
pull my finger.:::['7-18-140']

on her behalf.:::['7-18-166']
and i'm sure that jessica......would like to thank my parents......who always believed in me.:::['7-18-167']
and she'd also like to thank my friends::::['7-18-168']
chandler, monica, ross, phoebe and rachel......who's sitting right there.:::['7-18-169']
joey, why did we have to rush out of there so fast?:::['7-18-170']
we had to get out of there because... look what i won! ha-ha-ha.:::['7-18-171']
oh, my god. you stole her award.:::['7-18-172']
no, no, no. i'm accepting it on her behalf.:::['7-18-173']
i don't think you know what "behalf" means.:::['7-18-174']
sure i do. it's a verb. as in "i be half-in' it"!:::['7-18-175']
you have got to take this back. why? i should've won one. i really wanted it.:::['7-18-177']
she didn't even care enough to come to the thing. it could also be a grammy.:::['7-18-178']
no, joey.:::['7-18-179']
come on, rach. no one saw me take it. there was a whole table full of them.:::['7-18-180']
do you really want an award that you didn't win?:::['7-18-181']
no, i want an award i did win. but nobody's given me any of those!:::['7-18-182']
plus, look, hey, rach. if i put it up, when people come over, they'll see it......and they'll think i won it.:::['7-18-183']
joey, it says "best supporting actress.":::['7-18-184']
i can scratch that right off.:::['7-18-185']
joey, no, this is wrong. you have to take it back.:::['7-18-186']
okay? you don't wanna win an award this way. you're very talented.:::['7-18-187']
and someday you're gonna win one of these for real and that one is gonna mean something.:::['7-18-188']
oh, all right. all right? thank you.:::['7-18-189']
i'll take it back tomorrow. thank you.:::['7-18-190']
if i can't have it, you can't have it! aah!:::['7-18-191']
professor geller? yes, mr. lewis? how can i help you?:::['7-18-192']
i know i didn't do well on my midterms and stuff......but i was kind of hoping:::['7-18-193']
you could change my grade.:::['7-18-194']
and why exactly would i do that?:::['7-18-195']
because i'm in love with you.:::['7-18-196']
yeah. i'm all in love with you and stuff.:::['7-18-198']
so could you change my grade? no!:::['7-18-199']
well, why not? you changed ned's grade.:::['7-18-200']
well, that's different, okay? because he was actually in love with me.:::['7-18-201']
no, he's not! he's totally yanking your chain.:::['7-18-202']
he's done this with three other teachers.:::['7-18-203']
what? he's got a girlfriend.:::['7-18-204']
i can't believe someone would do that for a grade.:::['7-18-205']
it's awful.:::['7-18-207']
i just keep thinking about all these things i'm not gonna have......and it's freaking me out.:::['7-18-210']
i don't know what to do about it.:::['7-18-211']
okay. don't sweat it.:::['7-18-212']
chandler is nowhere around, so get it out of your system. that guy's cute.:::['7-18-213']
phoebe, come on, i'm serious.:::['7-18-214']
i've just gotta talk to him about all this. that is the last thing you wanna do.:::['7-18-215']
why? because you're marrying him!:::['7-18-216']
you gotta help me out here, pheebs.:::['7-18-217']
all right, i've never been engaged and i've never really been married.:::['7-18-218']
but i can only tell you what my mother told me.:::['7-18-219']
whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship......do not communicate them:::['7-18-220']
to your husband.:::['7-18-221']
so i'm not supposed to share my doubts and fears......with the guy i'm spending:::['7-18-222']
the rest of my life with?:::['7-18-223']
that is correct. yes.:::['7-18-224']
you're supposed to put all that stuff in a little box in your mind......and then lock it up tight.:::['7-18-225']
your mother told you this? yes.:::['7-18-226']
the woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13?:::['7-18-227']
oh, my god, you're right.:::['7-18-228']
all right, go. go tell chandler. hurry, before it's too late!:::['7-18-229']
wait, no! does this also mean that putting out doesn't get you love?:::['7-18-230']
i can't believe i'm gonna meet jessica ashley! wait, wait.:::['7-18-231']
please be cool, okay? i work with this woman.:::['7-18-232']
okay, i'm totally cool. okay.:::['7-18-233']
jessica: come in.:::['7-18-234']
hey, jessica. hey, jess.:::['7-18-235']
this is my friend rachel.:::['7-18-236']
hi. what's up?:::['7-18-237', '5-10-107']
uh, listen, here's your soapie. i accepted it for you.:::['7-18-238']
oh, my god. i won? do you have any idea what this means?:::['7-18-239']
that's it. you're not gonna put it on your shelf or anything?:::['7-18-240']
no, i try to save that for real awards. now if you'll excuse me?:::['7-18-241']
joey: hm!:::['7-18-242']
take it back? absolutely.:::['7-18-243']
yeah, you do.:::['7-18-245', '7-24-275', '4-19-84', '3-4-209']
honey? as we get closer to the wedding... hm?:::['7-18-246']
...is there anything you'd like to talk about or share?:::['7-18-247']
okay. well, i think the centerpieces are too big.:::['7-18-248']
you're wrong. the centerpieces are fine.:::['7-18-249']
do you ever get scared at all? kind of. they're really big.:::['7-18-250']
doesn't it ever freak you out that you're never gonna be with anybody new again?:::['7-18-251']
just... i love you so much. just...:::['7-18-253']
it's just sometimes it bothers me that i'm never gonna have that feeling.:::['7-18-254']
when you first meet someone for the first time......and it's new and exciting.:::['7-18-255']
you know that rush?:::['7-18-256']
no, see, when i first meet somebody......it's mostly panic, anxiety:::['7-18-258']
and a great deal of sweating.:::['7-18-259']
okay, but... all right, you're a guy.:::['7-18-260']
does it not freak you out that you're never gonna sleep with anybody else?:::['7-18-261']
sleeping with somebody, no.:::['7-18-262']
anxiety, panic and i'm afraid even more sweating.:::['7-18-263']
even with me?:::['7-18-264']
i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship.:::['7-18-265']
look, for me the rush is knowing that we are gonna be together for the rest of our lives.:::['7-18-266']
really? well, yeah.:::['7-18-267']
knowing you're having these thoughts, we're back to panic, anxiety and, uh......i'm definitely gonna need:::['7-18-268']
some kind of sports drink.:::['7-18-269']
come here. come here. oh, sweetie, you don't have to worry.:::['7-18-270']
no. besides, you know what? i'm gonna have a lot of new things with you.:::['7-18-271']
the first time we buy a house, our first kid, our first grandkid.:::['7-18-272']
water. water. water.:::['7-18-273']
uh, mr. morse? can i speak to you for a moment?:::['7-18-274']
that was a great lecture today. did you get a haircut? mm-hm.:::['7-18-275']
yeah, yeah. do you like it? do you love it?:::['7-18-276']
i want you to know that i'm changing your grade back.:::['7-18-277']
because i know what you're trying to pull here. it's not gonna work.:::['7-18-279']
i'm not trying to pull anything. look, i love you, dude.:::['7-18-280']
you know what, i'm not even gonna talk about this. this little "thing" is over.:::['7-18-281']
i know you have a girlfriend. yeah. and i know about the other professors.:::['7-18-282']
how do you think that makes me feel, ned? you used me!:::['7-18-283']
you don't love me and you never did!:::['7-18-284']
ah, professor winston. professor frederickson.:::['7-18-285']
i'll be right with you.:::['7-18-286']
don't make this worse and i'll give you a c. shall we?:::['7-18-287']
rach?:::['7-18-288']
rachel: i'll be out in a second. hm.:::['7-18-289']
"it's just so unexpected! i...:::['7-18-290']
i'll tell you, it's just such an honor to just be nominated......for a nobel prize.:::['7-18-292']
and, you know, to win one for a massage! oh...:::['7-18-293']
especially after having just won a tony award for best actress...":::['7-18-294']
we have to go. our reservations are at 8.:::['7-18-295']
"...in reservations at eight by neil simon.:::['7-18-296']
thank you, neil. thank you for the words.":::['7-18-297']
you can finish this later. we're gonna be late. we gotta go.:::['7-18-298']
please don't play the music. just one more thing.:::['7-18-299']
"live from new york, it's saturday night!":::['7-18-301']
i know. monica's gonna have a baby.:::['7-24-1']
can this count as her "something new"?:::['7-24-2']
do you think this is why chandler took off?:::['7-24-4']
she had to have just taken it. i took out the trash last night.:::['7-24-5']
it's turning into the worst wedding ever.:::['7-24-6']
the bride's pregnant, the groom's missing and i'm holding this.:::['7-24-7']
phoebe, we cannot tell anyone about this.:::['7-24-8']
right. yeah. okay?:::['7-24-9']
do you know what kind of birth control she uses?:::['7-24-10']
just for the future. this is hardly a commercial for it.:::['7-24-12']
anything?:::['7-24-13']
no. i talked to joey. he hasn't heard from him.:::['7-24-14']
i talked to chandler's parents again.:::['7-24-15']
you said he was missing? no.:::['7-24-16']
it seemed like i called to chat.:::['7-24-17']
pretty sure they both think i'm interested.:::['7-24-18']
we've got to tell her. no, we can't.:::['7-24-19']
she'll start getting ready soon.:::['7-24-20']
can't you stall her? i'll go to the places i went last night.:::['7-24-21']
how much time?:::['7-24-22']
how long before she has to get ready?:::['7-24-23']
one hour. give me two.:::['7-24-24']
then why do you ask?:::['7-24-25']
wish me luck. i'm going with you.:::['7-24-26']
you're tired. you looked all night. and clearly, you suck at this.:::['7-24-28']
see you later. wait, do you know how you're gonna stall her?:::['7-24-29']
i'll figure something out. okay, good luck.:::['7-24-30']
let's start with my makeup and then do my hair.:::['7-24-31']
okay. but before you do that, i need you to talk to me.:::['7-24-32']
you will. the right guy's around the corner.:::['7-24-35']
okay, are we done with that?:::['7-24-36']
no, i'm serious.:::['7-24-37']
maybe i should just forget about it. become a lesbian or something.:::['7-24-38']
any woman would be lucky to have you.:::['7-24-39']
maybe i'd feel better if i slept with joey.:::['7-24-40']
rachel? are you okay?:::['7-24-41']
excuse me, aaron? i have a little problem with the schedule.:::['7-24-42']
i wasn't supposed to work today. i have a wedding that i have to be at.:::['7-24-43']
it's my best friend's, and i'm officiating......so i really can't work past 4.:::['7-24-44']
you've gotta stay until the end. we can't stop filming just for you.:::['7-24-45']
it's not like it's your wedding.:::['7-24-46']
i'm having surgery.:::['7-24-47']
i made up the wedding, because i didn't want you to worry.:::['7-24-49']
but i'm having surgery today.:::['7-24-50']
what kind of surgery?:::['7-24-51']
transplant.:::['7-24-52']
you're supposed to work on monday.:::['7-24-53']
hair transplant.:::['7-24-54']
but you're not bald.:::['7-24-55']
it's not on my head.:::['7-24-56']
there's nothing i can do. you'll probably be out by 4 anyway.:::['7-24-57']
we've got one scene. it's just you and richard, and he's a pro.:::['7-24-58']
you'll be fine.:::['7-24-59']
morning, richard.:::['7-24-60']
hey, you're here. great. let's go, buddy.:::['7-24-61']
we got a scene to shoot.:::['7-24-62']
i'm wearing two belts.:::['7-24-63']
are you drunk? no.:::['7-24-64']
yes, you are.:::['7-24-65', '10-5-157']
so this is your office?:::['7-24-67']
how'd you guys find me? i knew i should've hid at the gym.:::['7-24-68']
what the hell are you doing? panicking.:::['7-24-69']
and using the internet to try to prove that i'm related to monica.:::['7-24-70']
how is she? ross: she doesn't know you're gone.:::['7-24-71']
and she doesn't have to know. come on, we're going home.:::['7-24-72']
i can't do that. why not?:::['7-24-73']
if i go home, we're gonna become the bings.:::['7-24-74']
i can't be the bings.:::['7-24-75']
what's wrong with it?:::['7-24-76']
the bings have bad marriages.:::['7-24-77']
they yell, fight, and use the pool boy......as a pawn in their sexual games.:::['7-24-78']
have you ever put on a black dress and asked me up to your hotel room?:::['7-24-79']
no. then you are neither of your parents.:::['7-24-80']
it's not just their marriage. look at yours. look at everybody's.:::['7-24-81']
only paul newman can make marriage work.:::['7-24-82']
and i am no paul newman.:::['7-24-83']
i don't race cars or make popcorn. none of my proceeds go to charity.:::['7-24-84']
but look, chandler......right now no one has:::['7-24-85']
a lower opinion of you than i do.:::['7-24-86']
but i totally believe you can do this.:::['7-24-87']
i want to. i love her so much, but i'm afraid...:::['7-24-88']
ahem. it's too huge.:::['7-24-89']
you're right. it is huge.:::['7-24-90']
so let's take it just a little bit at a time.:::['7-24-91']
forget getting married for a sec.:::['7-24-92']
can you just come home and take a shower?:::['7-24-93']
that's not scary, right?:::['7-24-94']
depends on what you mean by "we.":::['7-24-95']
the nights are the hardest.:::['7-24-96']
but then the day comes......and that's every bit as hard as the night.:::['7-24-97']
then the night comes... days and nights are hard, i get it.:::['7-24-98']
i have to start getting ready. i'm getting married today.:::['7-24-99']
i know. at dusk.:::['7-24-100']
that's such a hard time for me.:::['7-24-101']
i'm gonna put makeup on. we have to be there in an hour.:::['7-24-102']
wait. what?:::['7-24-103']
i can't go to lunch.:::['7-24-105']
oh, good god, i've fallen down.:::['7-24-107']
all right, honey, listen.:::['7-24-110']
when i tell you what i'm about to tell you, remember......that we're all here for you,and we love you.:::['7-24-111']
okay, you're really freaking me out.:::['7-24-112']
we can't find chandler...:::['7-24-113']
his vest.:::['7-24-114']
we can't find chandler's vest.:::['7-24-115']
how can that be? wait, are you serious?:::['7-24-116']
found the vest.:::['7-24-117']
we'll have to keep an eye on it, make sure we don't lose it again.:::['7-24-118']
oh, wow. okay, don't scare me like that, okay?:::['7-24-120']
for a minute, i was like, "oh, my god. the worst has happened.":::['7-24-121']
so you two were married, huh?:::['7-24-122']
what happened, you just drift apart?:::['7-24-123']
here comes the bride.:::['7-24-124']
oh, my god, monica.:::['7-24-125']
i want to wear this every day.:::['7-24-126']
you look so beautiful.:::['7-24-127']
i'm so happy for me.:::['7-24-128']
hello? did chandler show up yet?:::['7-24-129']
we got him back. everything's fine. damn it.:::['7-24-130']
where are you? i'm still on the set.:::['7-24-131']
the wedding is in less than an hour.:::['7-24-132']
i'm sorry. the guy's drunk. they won't let me go until we get it.:::['7-24-133']
oh, my god. i'm gonna have to find another minister.:::['7-24-134']
no, i'm the minister.:::['7-24-135']
put them both on the phone and i'll marry them right now.:::['7-24-136']
joey, i have to go.:::['7-24-137']
don't hang up on me. i'll marry you and me right now. i have the power.:::['7-24-138']
there you go. you put on a tuxedo.:::['7-24-139']
that wasn't scary, was it?:::['7-24-140']
i'm telling you, just a little bit at a time.:::['7-24-142']
okay. what's the next little bit?:::['7-24-143']
getting married. oh, ah.:::['7-24-144']
you can do that too. just like you've done everything else.:::['7-24-145']
yeah, you're right. i can do that. yeah.:::['7-24-146']
excuse me for a minute. where you going?:::['7-24-147']
i'm not gonna run away. i just want some fresh air.:::['7-24-148']
oh, fresh air.:::['7-24-150']
rachel: cover for me. phoebe: maybe you overreacted.:::['7-24-151']
rachel: we gotta do something.:::['7-24-152']
joey won't make it, so i'll look around for other weddings.:::['7-24-153']
don't tell them monica's pregnant, because they frown on that.:::['7-24-154']
"anastassakis papasifakis wedding." excellent.:::['7-24-156']
hi. oh, great hat.:::['7-24-159']
i need you to perform another wedding. can you do that?:::['7-24-160']
i don't know. are they greek orthodox?:::['7-24-161']
they're my friends, monica stephanopolis.:::['7-24-163']
and chandler acidophilus.:::['7-24-164']
has anyone seen chandler?:::['7-24-167']
i thought he was with you. he was with me.:::['7-24-168']
we're playing a game. hide-and-seek.:::['7-24-169']
you can't ask us, son. that's cheating.:::['7-24-170']
you're right. thanks for keeping me honest, dad.:::['7-24-171']
he can't come here and see the bride in her wedding dress.:::['7-24-172']
when we got married, i saw the groom in the wedding dress.:::['7-24-173']
that was after the wedding. it's not bad luck then.:::['7-24-174']
honey, it isn't good luck.:::['7-24-175']
oh, my god. monica.:::['7-24-176']
how's chandler doing? great.:::['7-24-178']
he's doing great. don't you worry about chandler.:::['7-24-179']
phoebe, can i see you for a second? yeah.:::['7-24-180']
what's going on? chandler's gone again.:::['7-24-181']
why would you play hide-and-seek with someone you know is a flight risk?:::['7-24-182']
aaron, you gotta let me go. the guy's hammered.:::['7-24-183']
i'm sorry. as long as he's here and conscious, we're still shooting.:::['7-24-184']
you wouldn't happen to have a very big fork?:::['7-24-185']
so i just talked to the director.:::['7-24-186']
that's it. we're done for the day.:::['7-24-187']
we finished the scene?:::['7-24-188']
yeah. you were wonderful. as were you.:::['7-24-189']
so i got your car. it's right outside.:::['7-24-190']
no, we gotta go. come on. here we go.:::['7-24-192']
is that my ass?:::['7-24-193']
there he is! what?:::['7-24-194']
hey! whoa!:::['7-24-195']
you won't get away this time!:::['7-24-196']
unless you want that ass-kicking we talked about.:::['7-24-197']
ross. hi-yah!:::['7-24-198']
i'm serious. you're not walking out on my sister.:::['7-24-199']
that's right. i'm not.:::['7-24-200']
then where have you been? i know about monica.:::['7-24-201']
you know? what?:::['7-24-202']
i heard you and rachel talking. about what?:::['7-24-203']
you don't know?:::['7-24-204']
if somebody doesn't tell me right now...:::['7-24-205']
what, you'll "hi-yah"?:::['7-24-206']
oh, my god. and you're not freaking out?:::['7-24-209']
i was. then i went to the gift shop for cigarettes.:::['7-24-210']
cigarettes? big picture, please.:::['7-24-211']
so i was in the gift shop, that's when i saw this...:::['7-24-212']
and i thought anything that can fit into this can't be scary.:::['7-24-213']
you obviously didn't see chuckie iii.:::['7-24-214']
but come on, look at how cute and small this is.:::['7-24-215']
so i got it to give monica, so she'd know i was okay.:::['7-24-216']
way to go, son. i knew you'd find him.:::['7-24-218']
our little boy is getting married.:::['7-24-219']
look at you, so handsome.:::['7-24-220']
you look beautiful, mom.:::['7-24-221']
you look beautiful too, dad.:::['7-24-222']
i love you both.:::['7-24-223', '3-21-279']
i'm so glad you're here.:::['7-24-224']
are you chandler?:::['7-24-225']
are you joey?:::['7-24-226']
huh. this is nice. what?:::['7-24-227']
i've never walked down the aisle knowing it can't end in divorce.:::['7-24-228']
i wish your grandmother had lived to see this.:::['7-24-229']
she's right there. not that old crone. my mother.:::['7-24-230']
congratulations, darling.:::['7-24-231']
we love you, sweetheart.:::['7-24-232']
you look beautiful.:::['7-24-233', '2-23-290']
is this new? not now.:::['7-24-234']
who's this? i'm father karabasos.:::['7-24-235']
he's greek orthodox.:::['7-24-236']
as are you.:::['7-24-237']
priest: let us begin.:::['7-24-238']
dearly beloved...:::['7-24-239']
that's my line.:::['7-24-240']
i can take it from here. thanks.:::['7-24-241']
dearly beloved, i'm sorry i'm a little late.:::['7-24-242']
you may be confused by this now......but you won't be:::['7-24-243']
memorial day weekend, 2002.:::['7-24-244']
let's get started before the groom takes off again.:::['7-24-245']
we are gathered here today......to join this man......and this woman:::['7-24-246']
in the bonds of holy matrimony.:::['7-24-247']
i've known monica and chandler for a long time, and i can't......imagine two people more perfect:::['7-24-248']
for each other.:::['7-24-249']
and now, as i've left my notes in my dressing room......we shall proceed to the vows. monica?:::['7-24-250']
he took off? go on. go on.:::['7-24-251']
chandler, for so long......i wondered if i would ever find my prince.:::['7-24-252']
my soul mate.:::['7-24-253']
then three years ago, at another wedding......i turned to a friend for comfort.:::['7-24-254']
and instead, i found everything that i'd been looking for my whole life.:::['7-24-255']
and now......here we are......with our future before us.:::['7-24-256']
and i only want to spend it with you.:::['7-24-257']
my prince. my soul mate.:::['7-24-258']
my friend.:::['7-24-259']
unless you don't want to.:::['7-24-260']
you go.:::['7-24-261', '5-12-78', '4-23-311']
i thought this would be the most difficult thing i ever had to do.:::['7-24-264']
but when i saw you walking down that aisle, i realized it's simple.:::['7-24-265']
any surprises that come our way, it's okay, because i will always love you.:::['7-24-267']
you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with.:::['7-24-268']
you want to know if i'm sure?:::['7-24-269']
you may now kiss the bride.:::['7-24-270']
i guess by the powers vested in me by the state of new york......and the internet guys......i now pronounce you husband and wife.:::['7-24-272']
oh, wait. do you take each other?:::['7-24-273']
i do. i do.:::['7-24-274']
rings?:::['7-24-276']
oh, crap.:::['7-24-277', '7-17-229', '10-14-315']
let's do the rings.:::['7-24-278']
we good? yeah? good?:::['7-24-279']
once again......i pronounce you husband and wife.:::['7-24-280']
now kiss her again.:::['7-24-281']
and i know about the baby.:::['7-24-283']
what baby? our baby.:::['7-24-284']
we have a baby?:::['7-24-285']
phoebe found your pregnancy test.:::['7-24-286']
i didn't take a pregnancy test.:::['7-24-287']
then who did?:::['7-24-288', '4-22-229']
look at them.:::['7-24-289']
and they're gonna have a baby.:::['7-24-290']
ben: i'm ready.:::['7-9-0']
you sure? uh-huh.:::['7-9-1']
okay, let me just straighten out your helmet there.:::['7-9-2']
thanks, daddy. no, no. one daddy, two mommies.:::['7-9-3']
all right, it's all yours. okay, okay.:::['7-9-4']
there you go, there you go.:::['7-9-5']
wow, ben's first big kid's bike. this is so exciting.:::['7-9-6']
oh, yeah, i remember mine.:::['7-9-7']
it was my sixth birthday. my dad took me to the park......and i got on it and... it bent.:::['7-9-8']
i never had a bike of my own. what?:::['7-9-10']
well, we didn't have a lot of money.:::['7-9-11']
but the girl across the street had the best bike.:::['7-9-12']
it was pink and it had rainbow-colored tassels hanging off the handle grips......and a bell,and this big, white wicker basket......with those:::['7-9-13']
plastic daisies stuck on.:::['7-9-14']
that sounds like my first bike.:::['7-9-15']
my dad gave me his old one.:::['7-9-16']
did the girl ever let you ride it? no.:::['7-9-17']
but she gave me the box that it came in.:::['7-9-18']
it had a picture of the bike on the front.:::['7-9-19']
so i would sit on it and my stepdad would drag me around the backyard.:::['7-9-20']
that is so unfair.:::['7-9-21']
not really, i got to drag him around too.:::['7-9-22']
hey, what are you guys doing?:::['7-9-23', '10-1-64', '2-2-10']
making holiday candy for the neighbors.:::['7-9-24']
i'm sorry, who?:::['7-9-25']
i'm gonna hang this basket on the door.:::['7-9-26']
when the neighbors walk by, they can all take a piece.:::['7-9-27']
but we don't know the neighbors. i do.:::['7-9-28']
there's, uh, let's see, the guy with the mustache......smokes-a-lot lady,some kids i've seen......and the red-haired guy:::['7-9-29']
who does not like to be called rusty.:::['7-9-30']
see, this is exactly why i'm making this candy.:::['7-9-31']
we can learn their names and get to know our neighbors.:::['7-9-32']
wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?:::['7-9-33']
good morning.:::['7-9-34', '7-4-306', '2-13-2', '2-4-312', '4-9-318', '3-1-27']
ah, somebody's in a good mood. well, why shouldn't i be?:::['7-9-35']
i have great friends. i have a wonderful job...:::['7-9-36']
where you can make out with your assistant.:::['7-9-37']
come on, it's not a big deal.:::['7-9-38']
we stayed up all night coming up with a plan......so that us dating will not be a problem.:::['7-9-39']
oh, yeah? what's the plan?:::['7-9-40']
we... we are not......going to let it......be a problem.:::['7-9-41']
wow. it took you all night to come up with that plan?:::['7-9-42']
oh, well, you know, we did other stuff too.:::['7-9-43']
did you two?:::['7-9-44']
oh, monica, you know i don't sleep with guys on the first date.:::['7-9-45']
matt wire, mark lynn, ben wise... anymore.:::['7-9-46']
hi, tag, um, i have a conference call today, is that correct?:::['7-9-47']
yes, at 4. okay, thank you, that'll be all.:::['7-9-48']
did you see that?:::['7-9-50']
that mail guy had no idea there was something going on between us.:::['7-9-51']
i'd better get back to my desk. okay, hard worker.:::['7-9-52']
i'll remember to put that in your evaluation.:::['7-9-53']
my what? you've been here for two months now......and your boss is required:::['7-9-54']
to hand in a performance evaluation.:::['7-9-55']
but you know, there is one thing that i have yet to evaluate.:::['7-9-56']
are you serious? no, i've just always wanted to do that.:::['7-9-57']
can you help me clean this up?:::['7-9-58']
the basket is totally empty. my god, the neighbors ate all the candy.:::['7-9-59']
well, either that or, uh...:::['7-9-60']
did you eat all the neighbor candy? uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.:::['7-9-63']
but by the time i got to it there was only a couple pieces left.:::['7-9-64']
yeah. they've been coming by all day. they love it.:::['7-9-65']
they love my candy?:::['7-9-66']
oh, man, i gotta go make more. joey: hey, mon.:::['7-9-67']
make some more lasagna too. something might have happened to a huge chunk of it.:::['7-9-68']
ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.:::['7-9-69']
mine stole my newspaper.:::['7-9-70']
it's like a crime wave.:::['7-9-71']
pheebs, you, uh, got a second?:::['7-9-72']
ever since you, uh, told me that story about that bike......i couldn't stop thinking about it.:::['7-9-74']
i mean, everyone should have a first bike, you know? so...:::['7-9-75']
you like it? i love it.:::['7-9-77']
yeah? oh. oh, god...:::['7-9-78']
and i love you. ah.:::['7-9-79']
not that way.:::['7-9-80']
but the bike got you a lot closer. oh.:::['7-9-81']
well, uh, take it downstairs.:::['7-9-82']
you know, give it a test drive.:::['7-9-83']
okay. oh, my god.:::['7-9-84']
my first bike.:::['7-9-85']
thank you for the best present i've ever gotten.:::['7-9-86']
oh, and chandler's about to cry.:::['7-9-88']
am not.:::['7-9-89']
monica: who is that?:::['7-9-90']
don't worry, i'm brave. i am brave. i... i am brave.:::['7-9-91']
can you tell me who is there, please?:::['7-9-93']
gary: my name's gary. i live upstairs.:::['7-9-94']
do you know what time it is? it's candy time.:::['7-9-96']
my roommate says that they taste like little drops of heaven.:::['7-9-97']
oh, please. heh.:::['7-9-98', '4-5-65']
did you hear that? "little drops of heaven.":::['7-9-99']
four a.m.:::['7-9-100']
so can i get some candy?:::['7-9-101']
i am sorry, but some of us have to get up early and go to work.:::['7-9-102']
he does not know that i am not "some of us.":::['7-9-103']
um, listen, i'm sorry, but i'll put some out first thing in the morning.:::['7-9-104']
well, okay, i'll swing by later.:::['7-9-105']
you live in this building? mm-hm.:::['7-9-106']
mm. seems like i would have remembered you.:::['7-9-107']
mm. night, gar.:::['7-9-108']
so did you read your evaluation yet?:::['7-9-109']
no, it was marked "confidential.":::['7-9-110']
i just sent it down to human resources.:::['7-9-111']
okay, please, you're kidding, right? i wrote that one as a joke for you.:::['7-9-112']
a joke they would appreciate?:::['7-9-113']
i'm thinking no.:::['7-9-114']
what did you say? um, i said that you were a good kisser......and, uh, that i liked:::['7-9-115']
your teeny, tiny tushy.:::['7-9-116']
no, not my tushy.:::['7-9-117']
well, it gets worse.:::['7-9-118']
when asked if you take initiative, i wrote::::['7-9-119']
"yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision.":::['7-9-120']
and under problems with performance, i wrote, "dear god, i hope not.":::['7-9-121']
and then, uh... and then i drew a little smiley face.:::['7-9-122']
and then a small pornographic sketch.:::['7-9-123']
ross, that is so sweet of you to get phoebe that bike.:::['7-9-124']
when i heard the story, i almost cried.:::['7-9-125']
almost cried, huh?:::['7-9-126']
hear that, chandler? "almost" cried.:::['7-9-127']
hey, you cry every time somebody talks about titanic.:::['7-9-128']
those two had only each other.:::['7-9-129']
phoebe really likes the bike, huh?:::['7-9-130']
oh, yeah. i saw her walking it down the street the other day.:::['7-9-131']
she had these flowers in the basket. it was so cute.:::['7-9-132']
yeah, i saw her this morning walking it by the park.:::['7-9-133']
wait a minute, she was walking the bike? both times?:::['7-9-134']
hey, pheebs. oh, hi.:::['7-9-135']
hey, so you enjoying the bike? oh, uh-huh, so much. heh.:::['7-9-136']
pheebs, you, uh... you do know how to ride a bike, don't you? heh.:::['7-9-137']
can we see you ride it?:::['7-9-139']
this is why i told you never get involved with your assistant.:::['7-9-142']
and there's no such thing as keeping secrets when it comes to having affairs.:::['7-9-143']
did you hear that, chandler?:::['7-9-144']
no such thing.:::['7-9-145']
what happened? i'm just eating candy.:::['7-9-146']
maybe it's not as bad as i think. maybe they didn't take it the way i meant it.:::['7-9-147']
absolutely, you know? because "tushy" can mean both ass......and good worker.:::['7-9-148']
ugh, i just gotta get the thing back.:::['7-9-149']
rach? that sketch you mentioned?:::['7-9-150']
might it have looked a little something like this?:::['7-9-151']
oh, my god, joey.:::['7-9-152']
what is the matter with you? god.:::['7-9-153']
i tell you, this little talent came in handy before i could afford porn.:::['7-9-154']
hi, i'm sorry. i know it's after hours, but i really need candy.:::['7-9-155']
i'm sorry, i can't help you. see? rules are rules.:::['7-9-156']
please, i have people coming from out of town today.:::['7-9-157']
i told them all about your candy. you're kidding.:::['7-9-158']
out-of-towners, huh? heh. what did you tell them?:::['7-9-159']
i told them your candy was absolutely indescribable.:::['7-9-160']
well, some people have been saying it's "little drops of heaven," but whatever.:::['7-9-161']
please, can't you help me out? hey, chandler, do we know that lady?:::['7-9-162']
maybe. isn't she the woman who lives below you and has sex really loud?:::['7-9-163']
all right, i'll do it just this once.:::['7-9-164']
but you can't tell anybody. yes, yes, please, just give it to me.:::['7-9-165']
both: yeah, that's her.:::['7-9-166']
thank you. unbelievable.:::['7-9-167']
i can't believe that sign didn't work.:::['7-9-168']
you know what would work? stop making candy.:::['7-9-169']
but they like it.:::['7-9-170']
you mean they like you.:::['7-9-171']
is that why you became a chef, so that people would like you?:::['7-9-173']
heh. you want to talk about getting people to like you, huh, funny man?:::['7-9-174']
okay, now, just remember everything i taught you and you'll be fine.:::['7-9-175']
okay? here we go.:::['7-9-176']
ready, set...:::['7-9-177']
wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.:::['7-9-178']
maybe before we start we should just get another one.:::['7-9-179']
perhaps like an airplane seat, or a beanbag chair.:::['7-9-180']
phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay? you have to learn how to ride a bike.:::['7-9-181']
why? why do i have to learn?:::['7-9-182']
well, in case of an emergency. what kind of emergency?:::['7-9-183']
well, what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says::::['7-9-184']
"you ride this bike or i'll...:::['7-9-185']
i'll shoot you.":::['7-9-186']
okay. i would ring the bell to distract him......and then i would knock the gun out:::['7-9-187']
of his hand with a chinese throwing star.:::['7-9-188']
okay, phoebe, just get on the bike......and, hey, i'll hold you up:::['7-9-189']
and push you. okay?:::['7-9-190']
you won't let go?:::['7-9-191']
no. you swear?:::['7-9-192']
i swear.:::['7-9-193']
okay. come on.:::['7-9-194']
here we go. all right? all right? all right.:::['7-9-195']
feel good? all right, try pedaling.:::['7-9-196']
that's it, you're doing great. yes, take control.:::['7-9-197']
yes, yes, yes. whee! hey!:::['7-9-198']
you swore.:::['7-9-201']
i just thought you were doing so well. i am shocked. shocked.:::['7-9-202']
it's a legitimate learning technique.:::['7-9-203']
there's, uh, some people outside asking about candy.:::['7-9-206']
they're just gonna have to wait, aren't they? i only got two hands.:::['7-9-207']
need some help? no, you don't know the system.:::['7-9-208']
i don't need nobody messing with the system.:::['7-9-209']
by the way, the week before your wedding, you may not see a lot of me.:::['7-9-210']
oh, hello, liar.:::['7-9-211']
look, i'm really sorry i let go of the bike.:::['7-9-212']
i could've been killed, i hope you know.:::['7-9-213']
but can we please try it again?:::['7-9-215']
i mean, you were so close, phoebe.:::['7-9-216']
well, i would love to......but the bike got stolen:::['7-9-217']
and the police have no suspects.:::['7-9-218']
phoebe. what?:::['7-9-219']
what the hell?:::['7-9-220', '5-4-248']
all right, you know what?:::['7-9-221', '7-9-304', '5-24-153']
if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike, then i'm sorry......i'm just gonna have to take it back.:::['7-9-222']
because. because it's...:::['7-9-224']
it'd be like you having this guitar......and never playing it.:::['7-9-225']
okay, this guitar wants to be played.:::['7-9-226']
and this bike wants to be ridden.:::['7-9-227']
and if you don't ride it......you're killing its spirit.:::['7-9-228']
the bike......is dying.:::['7-9-229']
all right. if you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.:::['7-9-230']
you're making the bike very happy.:::['7-9-232']
okay, ross.:::['7-9-233']
please don't die.:::['7-9-234']
okay, i think we can get the evaluation back before they see it.:::['7-9-235']
we have to get into mr. zelner's office. he doesn't get in until 10, so no problem.:::['7-9-236']
but his assistant, betty, comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.:::['7-9-237']
that's kind of sad. yeah, well, betty's kind of sad.:::['7-9-238']
which is why i believe i can lure her away with these chocolates.:::['7-9-239']
now, while i distract her, you go in the office.:::['7-9-240']
got it. let's roll.:::['7-9-241']
hello, rachel. you, uh, got a minute?:::['7-9-242']
yeah, sure, mr. zelner. for you? anything. minute.:::['7-9-243']
abort the plan. abort the plan.:::['7-9-245']
uh, actually, i'd like to speak to both of you.:::['7-9-246']
uh, well, can we get you anything, mr. zelner? maybe some chocolates?:::['7-9-248']
um, no, thanks, but i'll give these to betty.:::['7-9-249']
so i read your evaluation of tag.:::['7-9-250']
or, uh, to use his full name, tag "sweet cheeks" jones?:::['7-9-251']
is something going on with you two?:::['7-9-252']
oh, my god, can you imagine if there was?:::['7-9-253']
i mean, what would happen exactly?:::['7-9-254']
well, i'd be forced to file a report.:::['7-9-255']
i'd have to consult with the legal department.:::['7-9-256']
and your future at the company would be in jeopardy.:::['7-9-257']
well... uh, mr. zelner......i'm the one:::['7-9-258']
who filled in that evaluation.:::['7-9-259']
oh, no... yeah, yeah, yeah.:::['7-9-260']
i thought it would be funny.:::['7-9-261']
you wrote that you have a cute tushy?:::['7-9-262']
i have a weird sense of humor.:::['7-9-264']
and i'm kind of strangely proud of my butt.:::['7-9-265']
it's kind of a risky joke, tag.:::['7-9-266']
and what is this drawing? i can't figure out what this is.:::['7-9-267']
you're looking at it upside down... you know what? it doesn't matter.:::['7-9-268']
hey, it's not like i don't have a sense of humor, huh?:::['7-9-269']
hell, i even enjoy a naughty limerick every now and then.:::['7-9-270']
but there's a time and a place, huh?:::['7-9-271']
unless you, uh, have a limerick right now.:::['7-9-272']
no? okay. well, uh, you've got my fax number.:::['7-9-273']
i can't believe you did that. that was really sweet.:::['7-9-274']
ah, don't worry about it. no, you could've lost your job.:::['7-9-275']
are you kidding me? with a cute butt like this, i'd find work.:::['7-9-276']
thank you, you're great.:::['7-9-277']
in fact...:::['7-9-280']
it's just... it took me so long to get that desk organized.:::['7-9-282']
we're waiting for the candy. bring out the candy.:::['7-9-286']
yeah, lady, give us candy.:::['7-9-287']
what's up, buddy? what are you doing?:::['7-9-289']
waiting to get candy.:::['7-9-290']
get in here.:::['7-9-291']
hey, and you cannot smoke in here.:::['7-9-292']
merry christmas.:::['7-9-293']
okay, guys, the candy is coming. i just need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.:::['7-9-294']
all right, everybody, just be quiet. be quiet. be quiet. pipe down.:::['7-9-295']
what is the matter with you people?:::['7-9-296']
this woman was trying to do a nice thing for you.:::['7-9-297']
she was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you......and i'll bet that not one of you:::['7-9-298']
can tell me her name.:::['7-9-299']
am i right?:::['7-9-300']
candy lady?:::['7-9-301']
no, not "candy lady.":::['7-9-302']
if we know it, can we have candy?:::['7-9-303']
forget it. all of you, forget it. you've ruined it.:::['7-9-305']
go home. you've ruined it. you've ruined it.:::['7-9-306']
that's all wrong. you guys ruined everything. you ruined it.:::['7-9-307']
no, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke directly into my mouth.:::['7-9-310']
uh, are you okay?:::['7-9-311', '3-20-191']
i'm fine now, but it was really scary there for a while.:::['7-9-312']
someone slipped a threatening note under the door.:::['7-9-313']
oh, yeah. sorry about that. mob mentality or whatever. i don't know.:::['7-9-314']
i can't believe it. i did it. i rode a bike.:::['7-9-315']
i never thought i'd be able to do that. thank you, ross.:::['7-9-316']
oh, hey, don't thank me. thank yourself.:::['7-9-317']
you're the one who faced your fears and ultimately overcame them.:::['7-9-318']
don't be so corny, ross. it's not an after school special.:::['7-9-319']
hey, everybody. happy thanksgiving. all: shh.:::['7-8-0']
what, are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year?:::['7-8-1']
no, we're playing this game i learned at work.:::['7-8-2']
you have to name all the states in six minutes.:::['7-8-3']
what? that's, like, insanely easy.:::['7-8-4']
no, it's harder than it sounds. you always forget at least one.:::['7-8-5']
or in some cases, 14.:::['7-8-6']
it's a stupid game and i wasn't playing against other people......so technically, i didn't lose.:::['7-8-7']
you forgot 14 states?:::['7-8-8']
nobody cares about the dakotas.:::['7-8-9']
oh, okay, time's up.:::['7-8-10']
all right, i got 48.:::['7-8-11']
oh, that's not bad. pheebs?:::['7-8-12']
oh, i got tired of naming states, so i decided to list the types of celery.:::['7-8-13']
and i have one, regular celery.:::['7-8-14']
okay, so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in......vegetables. joey?:::['7-8-15']
say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game.:::['7-8-16']
wow, how many you got? fifty-six.:::['7-8-17']
hey, how is new england not a state?:::['7-8-18']
huh? they have a sports team.:::['7-8-19']
does south oregon have a sports team?:::['7-8-20']
how come we have one extra place setting?:::['7-8-22']
because you invited your assistant. oh, right, sorry. tag's not coming.:::['7-8-23']
his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending thanksgiving with her.:::['7-8-24']
oh, why didn't you tell me?:::['7-8-25']
i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.:::['7-8-26']
oh, well, i was going to, but then i figured, you know......your food is so delicious:::['7-8-27']
and perfect......you can never have too many:::['7-8-28']
of those pumpkin things.:::['7-8-29']
you'd think i wouldn't enjoy that because it is so fake, ha, ha, but i still do.:::['7-8-30']
regular celery. oh, i already have that.:::['7-8-31']
done, with time to spare.:::['7-8-32']
ooh, this may be a new world's record. you know, i hate to lecture you guys......but it's kind of disgraceful that:::['7-8-33']
a group of well-educated adults......and joey, can't name all the states.:::['7-8-34']
you ever see a map or one of those round colorful things called a globe?:::['7-8-35']
uh, magellan? you got 46 states.:::['7-8-36']
what? that's impossible. joey: forty-six.:::['7-8-37']
well, who's well-educated now, mr. i-forgot-ten-states?:::['7-8-38']
i'm out of oven space. i'm gonna go turn on joey's.:::['7-8-39']
please, watch him. do not let joey eat any of the food.:::['7-8-40']
i am only one man.:::['7-8-41']
okay, time is up. give me another minute.:::['7-8-42']
ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay?:::['7-8-43']
that is the beauty of this game. it makes you want to kill yourself.:::['7-8-44']
this is crazy. i can do this.:::['7-8-45']
all right, uh, i bet i can get all 50, uh, before dinner.:::['7-8-46']
okay, but if you can't, no dinner.:::['7-8-47']
you're on.:::['7-8-48']
all right, don't look at my list, because there's a lot on there that you don't have.:::['7-8-49']
hey, did you guys know your oven doesn't work?:::['7-8-50']
but the drawer full of takeout menus is okay, right?:::['7-8-51']
ross, i'm gonna use yours, okay? shh.:::['7-8-52']
chandler, give me a hand.:::['7-8-53']
sure. joey, do not let ross look at any maps or the globe in your apartment.:::['7-8-54']
don't worry, chandler. it's not a globe of the united states.:::['7-8-55']
hey, you guys, i'm gonna go out and take a walk.:::['7-8-56']
phoebe, why is your bag moving?:::['7-8-57']
oh, it's not. seriously, it's moving.:::['7-8-58']
what the hell's in there? it's just my knitting. that's all.:::['7-8-59']
yes, i knit this.:::['7-8-60']
i'm very good.:::['7-8-61']
ross' apartment is nice. why don't we hang out here more often?:::['7-8-62']
i don't know. maybe because it smells weird.:::['7-8-63']
it's like old pumpkins or something.:::['7-8-64']
that's my pie. which smells delicious.:::['7-8-65']
uh-oh. uh-oh. what? we left joey alone with the food.:::['7-8-66']
yep, yep, i knew it.:::['7-8-67']
there he is......feeding stuffing to a dog.:::['7-8-68']
hi, geller-bing residence. how can i help?:::['7-8-69']
phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?:::['7-8-70']
i'm sorry, who's this?:::['7-8-71']
phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch.:::['7-8-72']
tell her i'm allergic, and i will sue.:::['7-8-73']
no, there's no dog here. there is.:::['7-8-74']
he's black and white and shaggy.:::['7-8-75']
he's sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand.:::['7-8-76']
oh, my god. where are you?:::['7-8-77']
they're here already? how are they doing this?:::['7-8-79']
hi, tag. what are you doing here?:::['7-8-80', '7-4-164']
i, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend thanksgiving with you was still good.:::['7-8-81']
well, sure. come in.:::['7-8-82']
well, what happened to your girlfriend?:::['7-8-83']
we, uh, kind of broke up this morning.:::['7-8-84']
oh, i'm sorry. yeah, so she went back to ohio.:::['7-8-85']
ohio, thank you.:::['7-8-86']
huh. where's the dog?:::['7-8-87']
what dog? there's no dog here.:::['7-8-88']
yeah, that dog left.:::['7-8-89']
phoebe, open up.:::['7-8-91']
phoebe: there's no dog in here.:::['7-8-92']
phoebe, we can hear the dog barking.:::['7-8-93']
phoebe: no, that's just me coughing.:::['7-8-94']
oh, good. there you are.:::['7-8-95']
listen, um, i have a dog in my room.:::['7-8-96']
what is it doing here?:::['7-8-97']
i'm watching it for friends who went out of town.:::['7-8-98']
hello, my name is klunkers.:::['7-8-100']
may i please stay with you nice people?:::['7-8-101']
oh, i wish he could stay here, but chandler's allergic.:::['7-8-102']
extremely allergic, okay?:::['7-8-103']
if i am anywhere near a dog for more than five minutes......my throat will just close up.:::['7-8-104']
that's odd, because this dog's been living here for the past three days.:::['7-8-105']
if the dog has been here that long......and you haven't had a reaction,maybe you're not allergic to this dog.:::['7-8-107']
well, it still has to go, right?:::['7-8-108']
monica & phoebe: why?:::['7-8-109']
okay, it's, um... don't do it.:::['7-8-110']
don't do what? i have to.:::['7-8-111']
okay? it's time.:::['7-8-112']
okay, i hate dogs.:::['7-8-113']
ross & rachel: what? phoebe: that's crazy. why?:::['7-8-114']
told you.:::['7-8-115']
they are needy......they are jumpy, and you can't tell:::['7-8-116']
what they are thinking......and that scares me a little bit.:::['7-8-117']
you're right. they are scary. aah!:::['7-8-118']
she just ate a treat out of my hand!:::['7-8-119']
wait a minute. do you not like all dogs? i mean, not even puppies?:::['7-8-120']
is there a puppy here?:::['7-8-121']
you don't like puppies? okay, you are new.:::['7-8-122']
look, chandler, i told you. never tell anyone about this dog thing.:::['7-8-123']
it's like ross not liking ice cream.:::['7-8-124']
you don't like ice cream? it's too cold.:::['7-8-125']
okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.:::['7-8-126']
hurts my teeth.:::['7-8-127']
i don't wanna say this. i don't want you guys to hate me......but, uh, i don't think i can be:::['7-8-128']
around that dog anymore, okay?:::['7-8-129']
so either the dog goes or i go. huh.:::['7-8-130']
how can i not get this?:::['7-8-132']
i'm a college professor. i got 1450 on my sats.:::['7-8-133']
twelve fifty.:::['7-8-134']
damn, i forgot you were here.:::['7-8-135']
all right. we're gonna take klunkers to ross'.:::['7-8-136']
we'll be back in a minute.:::['7-8-137']
oh, wait, before you go, can i ask a question?:::['7-8-138']
um, when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend......what is an appropriate amount of time:::['7-8-139']
to wait before you make a move?:::['7-8-140']
oh, i'd say about a month.:::['7-8-141']
really? i'd say three to four. half-hour.:::['7-8-142']
interesting.:::['7-8-143', '10-17-138', '10-16-145', '10-8-301', '5-18-24', '4-14-212', '3-15-227']
when it's your assistant, i would say never.:::['7-8-144']
all right, rach, the big question is, does he like you?:::['7-8-145']
right? because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo point.:::['7-8-146']
huh. a "moo" point?:::['7-8-147']
yeah. it's like a cow's opinion.:::['7-8-148']
it just doesn't matter.:::['7-8-149']
it's "moo.":::['7-8-150']
have i been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?:::['7-8-151']
please don't listen to joey. okay? would you look at him?:::['7-8-152']
he's obviously depressed. he's away from his family.:::['7-8-153']
he's spending thanksgiving with strangers.:::['7-8-154']
what he needs right now is for you to be his friend.:::['7-8-155']
oh, you're right. i'm sorry. thank you.:::['7-8-156']
okay, that's what i'm going to do. fine, take their advice.:::['7-8-157']
no one ever listens to me.:::['7-8-158']
when the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.:::['7-8-159']
how you holding up?:::['7-8-161']
not bad. yeah?:::['7-8-162']
i'm sorry about your girlfriend. thanks.:::['7-8-163']
were you guys together a long time? a year, on and off.:::['7-8-164']
i thought we'd end up together. i don't anymore.:::['7-8-165']
now that she broke up with you. yeah.:::['7-8-166']
hmm. it's weird.:::['7-8-167']
i always used to assume that i would meet someone and fall in love and be happy.:::['7-8-168']
that all that was just a given. well, lately, it's like, what if it's not?:::['7-8-169']
do you ever have that feeling?:::['7-8-170']
all the time. constantly. it's terrifying.:::['7-8-173']
but, you know, then i figure it has to work out.:::['7-8-174']
because it has to.:::['7-8-176']
you have all the answers, don't you? yeah, i know, i do. i really do.:::['7-8-177']
hey, thanks for talking to me. come on, what are bosses for?:::['7-8-178']
hug it out.:::['7-8-179']
all right, he likes you back.:::['7-8-180']
huh? told you you should go for it.:::['7-8-181']
street noise drown any of that out?:::['7-8-183']
no? all right, i'll see you later. ha, ha. okay.:::['7-8-184']
what did joey say? i like you back?:::['7-8-185']
uh, yeah... you know, well, see, he...:::['7-8-186']
joey knows that i'm very insecure about my back.:::['7-8-187']
and... and you were hugging me......so obviously you are not:::['7-8-188']
repulsed by it. yeah. heh.:::['7-8-189']
wait a minute, that doesn't make any sense.:::['7-8-190']
all right, here's the truth. ahem.:::['7-8-192']
joey said what he said because, um......i'm attracted to you.:::['7-8-193']
wow. yeah, i admit it.:::['7-8-194']
i have a crush on you. and, uh, i know that's crazy because we work together......and nothing could ever happen.:::['7-8-195']
and the last thing i wanted to do was freak you out......or make you feel uncomfortable.:::['7-8-196']
which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.:::['7-8-197']
oh, my god. those guys are stealing my car.:::['7-8-198']
what? right there. that's my car.:::['7-8-199']
hey! okay, that's gonna take a minute.:::['7-8-200']
do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?:::['7-8-201']
wait, we still have time to talk, and they're not even in the car yet.:::['7-8-203']
oh, look, there they go. okay.:::['7-8-204']
okay, phoebe. we should probably go back now.:::['7-8-205']
please, don't leave me. i'll be lonely.:::['7-8-206']
stop it. stop.:::['7-8-207']
okay, let's go. we can be strong. yeah, okay.:::['7-8-208']
oh, my god, did you hear that? she said "monica.":::['7-8-209']
oh, i can't leave her.:::['7-8-210']
if you want, we could sneak the dog back in and chandler wouldn't even know.:::['7-8-211']
that's not gonna work.:::['7-8-212']
i had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea.:::['7-8-213']
he's not so smart.:::['7-8-214']
hey. i didn't know either.:::['7-8-215']
yeah, but you kind of knew that something was going on, didn't you?:::['7-8-216']
yeah, i knew. heh.:::['7-8-217']
where's chandler?:::['7-8-218']
here i am. wash your hands.:::['7-8-219']
hey, what's she doing back here?:::['7-8-221']
relax, ross. she's not made of ice cream.:::['7-8-222']
hey, look, phoebe. i, uh, laid out the states geographically.:::['7-8-223']
no, no, we don't have time for this.:::['7-8-224']
we have to keep chandler away from my room.:::['7-8-225']
yeah, but, look what i...:::['7-8-226']
see, this is exactly what we do not have time for.:::['7-8-227']
where's monica? uh, in phoebe's room. you can't go in.:::['7-8-228']
monica's crying.:::['7-8-230']
she's very upset about this whole klunkers thing.:::['7-8-231']
well, i should go in there. no, no.:::['7-8-232']
no, she doesn't want to see you right now.:::['7-8-233']
why not? because you sent away the dog.:::['7-8-234']
that's ridiculous. oh, is it? is it?:::['7-8-235']
look, when monica and i were kids, we had a dog named rover.:::['7-8-236']
and, um, one day, my dad decides he doesn't like dogs.:::['7-8-237']
so monica and her friend... phyllis......take away the dog, and that was:::['7-8-238']
the last time we ever saw him.:::['7-8-239']
don't you see? this is just like that......only with a few details changed.:::['7-8-240']
okay, i'm in my sweatpants.:::['7-8-241']
bring on the food.:::['7-8-242']
what's the matter? monica's all upset......because i sent klunkers away.:::['7-8-243']
so? bring the dog back. you're a hero.:::['7-8-244']
yeah, i could be a hero. i could do that. i could... i could do...:::['7-8-245']
what if it...? what if it attacks me?:::['7-8-246']
chandler, it's like a big gerbil.:::['7-8-247']
and that doesn't scare you?:::['7-8-248']
ross, you need some help?:::['7-8-249']
from you?:::['7-8-250']
first of all, utah?:::['7-8-252']
dude, you can't just make stuff up.:::['7-8-253']
i hate america.:::['7-8-254']
when i finish this game, i swear i am moving.:::['7-8-255']
hey. tag still talking to the police? yeah.:::['7-8-256']
ugh, damn it. why did i open my mouth?:::['7-8-257']
"i have a crush on you. i'm attracted to you.":::['7-8-258']
i know that i freaked him out.:::['7-8-259']
if you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.:::['7-8-260']
hey, is chandler here?:::['7-8-261', '3-8-36']
uh, no, no, he went for a walk.:::['7-8-262']
okay, well, you cannot tell him, but look who's back.:::['7-8-263']
hi. oh, no, no, no, no, no.:::['7-8-264']
he went over to ross' to bring the dog back here.:::['7-8-265']
oh, no, the dog's not going to be there.:::['7-8-266']
please, please, please, don't be mad at me.:::['7-8-269']
what? why would...? shh. wait and see.:::['7-8-270']
maybe we will, maybe we won't.:::['7-8-271']
okay, i went over to ross' apartment to bring back klunkers, you know, for you......and, ahem, i left the door open,and she must've gotten out.:::['7-8-272']
and i looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof.:::['7-8-273']
which, fyi, ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed.:::['7-8-274']
i couldn't find him......and i am so, so, so sorry.:::['7-8-275']
but i do know where we can all go ease the pain.:::['7-8-276']
we have good news. look who's back.:::['7-8-277']
klunkers. oh, my god.:::['7-8-279']
that's right. she came back all by herself. it's a thanksgiving miracle.:::['7-8-280']
it is so good to see you.:::['7-8-281']
yeah, she came all the way back from ross' building.:::['7-8-282']
oh, the things she must've seen.:::['7-8-283']
then she climbed up the fire escape......and she tapped on the window:::['7-8-284']
with her teeny little paw......and we ran to let her in.:::['7-8-285']
i went too far, didn't i?:::['7-8-286']
when should i have stopped?:::['7-8-287']
okay, maybe this is so hard because there aren't 50 states.:::['7-8-288']
let me tell you something. i have 49 states.:::['7-8-289']
now, there are no more.:::['7-8-290']
now, i think i should be able to eat something.:::['7-8-291']
it's up to you.:::['7-8-292']
oh, hi. how are you doing? i'm okay.:::['7-8-293']
i gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.:::['7-8-294']
thanks for having me over, you guys. tag, you're going? uh...:::['7-8-295']
we didn't, uh, get a chance to talk.:::['7-8-296']
so where did you say you're from again?:::['7-8-297']
colorado. ah, what good are you?:::['7-8-298']
look, um, i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.:::['7-8-299']
i never should've said what i said.:::['7-8-301']
you know what? it just doesn't matter how i feel.:::['7-8-302']
we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us.:::['7-8-303']
what i would love is just to go to work on monday and never talk about this again.:::['7-8-304']
okay? big day, monday. lots to do.:::['7-8-305']
so we okay?:::['7-8-306']
um, i'm not.:::['7-8-307']
oh, god, i knew it. i freaked you out. no, you didn't.:::['7-8-308']
the only thing that freaked me out was you saying......that nothing could happen between us.:::['7-8-309']
so please don't fire me for doing this.:::['7-8-311']
okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on monday.:::['7-8-312']
delaware.:::['7-8-313', '7-8-314']
all right. i want my turkey now.:::['7-8-315']
you got nevada twice.:::['7-8-317']
the reason i asked you to brunch......is because i've been thinking:::['7-6-0']
about my maid of honor.:::['7-6-1']
oh, my god. this is it. oh.:::['7-6-2']
i hope it's you.:::['7-6-3']
i hope it's you. me too.:::['7-6-4']
first of all, i love you both so much.:::['7-6-5']
you're both so important to me. blah, blah, blah. who is it?:::['7-6-6']
i was thinking we could come up with a system......where we trade off being maid of honor.:::['7-6-7']
hypothetically, if phoebe were mine... yes! oh.:::['7-6-8']
hypothetically.:::['7-6-9']
still.:::['7-6-10']
if phoebe were mine, rachel would be phoebe's, i'd be rachel's.:::['7-6-11']
we all get to do it and no one gets upset.:::['7-6-12']
that's a pretty good idea. i'll do that. so who's yours?:::['7-6-13']
well, that's the best part. you guys get to decide.:::['7-6-14']
why is that the best part? i don't have to.:::['7-6-15']
of course we'll help you decide. we'll do anything we can to help you.:::['7-6-16']
i'd like to make a toast.:::['7-6-17']
to the future mrs. chandler bing......my best friend and truly one:::['7-6-18']
of the nicest people that...:::['7-6-19']
really not deciding. fine.:::['7-6-20']
excuse me, i couldn't help overhearing.:::['7-6-21']
you're marrying chandler bing? yeah.:::['7-6-22']
good luck!:::['7-6-24', '4-5-32']
oh, and good luck to you too!:::['7-6-25']
what a nice lady.:::['7-6-26']
die hard, still great. yep.:::['7-6-28']
let's make it a double feature?:::['7-6-29']
what else did you rent?:::['7-6-30']
die hard 2.:::['7-6-31']
joey, this is die hard 1 again.:::['7-6-32']
well, we'll watch it a second time and it's die hard 2.:::['7-6-33']
joey, we just saw it. and?:::['7-6-34']
it would be cool to see it again!:::['7-6-35']
yeah! die hard! die hard!:::['7-6-36']
dude, you didn't say die hard.:::['7-6-37']
is everything okay?:::['7-6-38', '2-11-83']
yeah, i just got plans.:::['7-6-39']
well, john mcclane had plans.:::['7-6-40']
i want to leave before joey gets all worked up......and starts calling everybody "bitch.":::['7-6-41']
what are you talking about, bitch?:::['7-6-42']
hey, rachel. yeah?:::['7-6-43']
when i get married, will you be my maid of honor?:::['7-6-44']
oh, my god, phoebe. i mean, i'm just...:::['7-6-46']
if i'm your maid of honor, that means that you are monica's.:::['7-6-48']
well, if that's what you want. oh!:::['7-6-50']
no way, phoebe. i want to be monica's.:::['7-6-51']
why does it even matter? why does it matter to you?:::['7-6-52']
because this one is now.:::['7-6-53']
and it's two of our best friends.:::['7-6-54']
and who knows what you're gonna marry.:::['7-6-55']
what if i marry ross? or joey?:::['7-6-56']
you wouldn't.:::['7-6-57']
okay, look, rachel. i know you really want to do this......but i've never been:::['7-6-58']
maid of honor to anyone before.:::['7-6-59']
i know you've done it at least twice.:::['7-6-60']
yeah, but, phoebe... please let me finish.:::['7-6-61']
i guess that was it.:::['7-6-62']
okay. since you've never done it before, you can be monica's maid of honor.:::['7-6-64']
oh, thank you so much!:::['7-6-65']
yay.:::['7-6-66']
i'm gonna marry someone good.:::['7-6-67']
better than chandler. pfft.:::['7-6-69']
what happened? i don't know.:::['7-6-70']
we fell asleep. that is all.:::['7-6-71']
yeah. yeah? yeah.:::['7-6-72']
all right, well, i'd better go.:::['7-6-73']
i think that would be best. yeah.:::['7-6-74']
i'll talk to you later. okay.:::['7-6-75']
but not about this. no, never. never!:::['7-6-76']
so, uh... uh...:::['7-6-77']
bye. no touch. no touch.:::['7-6-78']
hey, a weird thing happened at brunch.:::['7-6-79']
this woman overheard that i was marrying you......and she wished me good luck.:::['7-6-80']
no, it was more like a "good luck.":::['7-6-82']
so, what did this woman look like?:::['7-6-83']
she was like 30, dark hair, attractive.:::['7-6-84']
any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?:::['7-6-85']
was it someone you dated in college?:::['7-6-86']
no, i only dated two girls in college......both blond, both not attractive.:::['7-6-87']
let me check this out.:::['7-6-88']
what are you doing? well, let's see.:::['7-6-89']
okay, uh, is that her?:::['7-6-90']
oh, my god, yes!:::['7-6-91']
who is she? julie graff, my camp girlfriend.:::['7-6-92']
did you break up with her?:::['7-6-93']
no, we're still together.:::['7-6-94']
we went out for two summers and then i broke up with her.:::['7-6-95']
why? she came back the third summer......and she'd gotten really fa... ahh.:::['7-6-96']
fat? i did not say fat.:::['7-6-97']
i said fa... ahh.:::['7-6-98']
you broke up with a girl because she was fat?:::['7-6-99']
but it was a really long time ago. does she still feel bad?:::['7-6-101']
apparently she does.:::['7-6-102']
you know what they say, "elephants never forget.":::['7-6-103']
seriously, good luck marrying me.:::['7-6-104']
phoebe is gonna be monica's maid of honor.:::['7-6-106']
hey. hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs.:::['7-6-107']
you have been maid of honor before?:::['7-6-108']
you see? this is exactly why you shouldn't lie.:::['7-6-109']
that's it. i am maid of honor.:::['7-6-110']
no, i am. how come you are?:::['7-6-111']
because i cared enough to lie.:::['7-6-112']
hey, i could help you decide who should do it.:::['7-6-113']
we could have an audition.:::['7-6-114']
see how you'd handle maid-of-honor-type situations.:::['7-6-115']
what are you talking about? when i want a job......i audition and if i'm the best:::['7-6-116']
of the people they see......they give me the part.:::['7-6-117']
okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?:::['7-6-118']
oh, me and ross can be the judges.:::['7-6-119']
it's better than us deciding. oh, this is crazy.:::['7-6-120']
can't we just flip a coin? no, coins hate me.:::['7-6-121']
okay, fine. you know what? we will let ross and joey decide.:::['7-6-122']
ross, sweetie.:::['7-6-124']
hey there, handsome thing.:::['7-6-125']
wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as giorgio.:::['7-6-126']
just brought back your videos.:::['7-6-128']
hey, ross. look, i think we need to talk about before.:::['7-6-129']
no. no, we don't.:::['7-6-130']
now, look. that was the best nap i ever had.:::['7-6-132']
come on, admit it.:::['7-6-134']
that was the best nap you ever had.:::['7-6-135']
i've had better.:::['7-6-136']
okay. when?:::['7-6-137']
all right! all right! it was the best nap ever!:::['7-6-138']
ah! i said it, okay?:::['7-6-139']
but it's over, joey!:::['7-6-140']
i want to do it again.:::['7-6-141']
we can't do it again.:::['7-6-142']
why not? because it's weird!:::['7-6-143']
you want a drink?:::['7-6-145']
sure. what do you got? warm milk and excedrin pm.:::['7-6-146']
i just figured out who you are.:::['7-6-148']
chandler: can you figure out what i'm doing?:::['7-6-149']
you're louis posen. who?:::['7-6-150']
he was my best friend in fifth grade.:::['7-6-151']
one day, i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no.:::['7-6-152']
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?:::['7-6-154']
no, but because he thought i was too fa... ahh.:::['7-6-155']
every time i think about it, i feel as bad as i did then.:::['7-6-156']
i really think you should apologize to julie.:::['7-6-157']
honey, are you kidding? that was like 16 years ago.:::['7-6-158']
it would make me feel better if louis apologized to me.:::['7-6-159']
i'll do it. but i warn you, this may make me a better person.:::['7-6-160']
and that is not the man you fell in love with.:::['7-6-161']
this is how it's gonna work. we'll give you hypothetical maid-of-honor situations.:::['7-6-162']
you'll be scored on a scale of one to 10.:::['7-6-163']
one being the highest. ten is the highest.:::['7-6-164']
why is 10 the highest? because it's the highest.:::['7-6-165']
okay, rachel, you're up first.:::['7-6-166']
situation number one: you're with monica.:::['7-6-167']
the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet. go!:::['7-6-168']
i don't want to marry chandler.:::['7-6-169']
i've got cold feet. it's gonna be okay.:::['7-6-170']
one man the rest of my life? i don't know.:::['7-6-171']
this means i'll never get to sleep with joey.:::['7-6-172']
look, monica......getting cold feet is very common.:::['7-6-173']
it's just because of all the anticipation.:::['7-6-174']
and you just have to remember that you love chandler.:::['7-6-175']
and also, i ran out on a wedding.:::['7-6-176']
you don't get to keep the gifts.:::['7-6-177']
very good, drawing on your own experience.:::['7-6-178']
yes, very nice, rachel.:::['7-6-180']
thank you, judges.:::['7-6-181']
kiss-ass. oh.:::['7-6-182']
okay, phoebe. yes, your honor.:::['7-6-183']
joey: we're now in the ceremony.:::['7-6-184']
monica is about to say, "i do"......when her drunk uncle starts yelling.:::['7-6-185']
what do you do? go!:::['7-6-186']
when monica was a little girl......i remember that...:::['7-6-187']
very good! oh.:::['7-6-189']
yes, excellent. perfect score.:::['7-6-190']
she just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!:::['7-6-191']
hey, you want a little taste of pheebs?:::['7-6-192']
it is time for you to give your maid-of-honor speech.:::['7-6-193']
we haven't even prepared...:::['7-6-194']
go! okay, okay, okay. um...:::['7-6-195']
webster's dictionary defines marriage as...:::['7-6-196']
okay, no! forget that! that sucks! okay, never mind. forget it. um, um...:::['7-6-197']
i met... i met monica when we were just a couple of 6-year-olds......and became friends with chandler:::['7-6-198']
when he was 25......although he seemed like a 6-year-old.:::['7-6-199']
thank you. thank you very much. um...:::['7-6-201']
i've known them separately and together.:::['7-6-202']
to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love.:::['7-6-203']
so i would like to raise my glass......to monica and chandler......and the beautiful adventure they:::['7-6-204']
are about to embark upon together.:::['7-6-205']
i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.:::['7-6-206']
great speech. yeah, it really was.:::['7-6-208']
rachel: oh, thanks.:::['7-6-209']
okay, phoebe, i guess you're next. although i really don't see the point.:::['7-6-210']
i can't believe that monica and chandler are getting married.:::['7-6-212']
i remember talking about this day with rachel......while we were showering together, naked.:::['7-6-213']
and she's back in the game!:::['7-6-214']
chandler: julie. hi.:::['7-6-215']
chandler bing. i guess you remember me.:::['7-6-216']
hello, skidmark.:::['7-6-217']
it's a nickname. i'll explain later.:::['7-6-218']
it's pretty clear.:::['7-6-219']
i owe you a long-overdue apology.:::['7-6-220']
i shouldn't have broken up with you because you were overweight.:::['7-6-221']
that's why you broke up with me?:::['7-6-222']
you didn't know that?:::['7-6-223']
well, i guess my work here is done.:::['7-6-224']
first of all, i would like to say you both performed very well, okay?:::['7-6-225']
you should be proud.:::['7-6-226']
and i'd also like to say, in this competition, there are no losers.:::['7-6-227']
well, except rachel. damn it!:::['7-6-228']
really? i won?:::['7-6-229']
what? i'm sorry, rach, it was really close.:::['7-6-230']
well, then i demand a recount! actually, it wasn't that close.:::['7-6-231']
you know what? your thing was so stupid anyway.:::['7-6-232']
we're gonna flip a coin, all right?:::['7-6-233']
heads. oh!:::['7-6-234']
what? the coins have finally forgiven me!:::['7-6-235']
you know what? i hope monica forgives you after you throw her......her vegetarian-voodoo-goddess-circle-y:::['7-6-236']
shower.:::['7-6-237']
rach, it's gonna be okay. you guys are the best!:::['7-6-238']
boy, i tell you. that judging stuff took a lot out of me.:::['7-6-239']
thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch.:::['7-6-241']
why would i care about that?:::['7-6-242']
no reason. i'm just saying that......that's where i'll be.:::['7-6-243']
as bad as that went, i actually enjoyed myself.:::['7-6-244']
i think that i'm going to apologize for all the stupid things that i do.:::['7-6-245']
why don't you just stop doing stupid things?:::['7-6-246']
then you wouldn't have to apologize. i'd love it if i could do both.:::['7-6-247']
all right, i have to ask.:::['7-6-248']
will you break up with me if i get fat again?:::['7-6-250']
you broke up with julie. how much weight did she gain?:::['7-6-252']
a hundred and forty-five pounds.:::['7-6-253']
in one year?:::['7-6-254']
my god, what did she eat? her family?:::['7-6-255']
i know it was a stupid reason to break up with someone, but i was 15.:::['7-6-257']
yeah, well, that's not the only time this was an issue.:::['7-6-258']
you remember when you spent thanksgiving with us?:::['7-6-259']
you called me fat.:::['7-6-260']
that was totally different. how?:::['7-6-262']
you were not supposed to hear that. i said that behind your back.:::['7-6-263']
what if i have babies, okay? i'm gonna look different.:::['7-6-264']
i'm okay with that, but i'm not sure you are.:::['7-6-265']
you have to realize i don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman.:::['7-6-266']
this is one of the things that i can apologize for later.:::['7-6-267']
what i mean is, you're monica.:::['7-6-268']
okay? and i am in love with monica.:::['7-6-269']
keep going.:::['7-6-270']
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down......and i will still love you.:::['7-6-271']
even if i shrink down to 2 inches tall?:::['7-6-272']
i'd carry you around in my pocket.:::['7-6-273']
skidmark still got a way with the ladies.:::['7-6-275']
hi, pheebs.:::['7-6-276', '5-2-60']
i just want to apologize.:::['7-6-278']
i'm really sorry i was a baby.:::['7-6-279']
that's ridiculous. rachel, we were all babies once.:::['7-6-280']
oh, you mean today. yeah.:::['7-6-281']
yeah, and you know, you deserve to win.:::['7-6-282']
and i was thinking about it.:::['7-6-283']
if you're monica's maid of honor, i get to be yours.:::['7-6-284']
oh, yeah. yeah.:::['7-6-285']
when monica and chandler got engaged, i put some stuff together.:::['7-6-286']
just in case. oh, that's so sweet. thanks.:::['7-6-287']
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves.:::['7-6-288']
oh, god, this is funny. look.:::['7-6-289']
here's a picture from one halloween when she dressed up as a bride.:::['7-6-290']
she made me carry her train......which was weird:::['7-6-291']
because i was wonder woman.:::['7-6-292']
oh, and here's a little purse that i found.:::['7-6-293']
i just thought they could hold the rings in there.:::['7-6-294']
oh. something. and......vintage handkerchiefs, you know,because people cry at weddings.:::['7-6-295']
i'm just gonna grab a couple of these.:::['7-6-296']
this stuff is great.:::['7-6-297']
i forgot this was in here.:::['7-6-298']
this was the garter that i was saving for my wedding.:::['7-6-299']
and i wanted it to be monica's "something borrowed.":::['7-6-300']
and it's blue.:::['7-6-301']
rach, i think that you should be monica's maid of honor.:::['7-6-303']
you do?:::['7-6-304', '2-11-263', '4-1-262']
why? because i think it means more to you.:::['7-6-305']
but, pheebs, honey, you earned it.:::['7-6-306']
it's fine. i mean, this is something......that you've been thinking about:::['7-6-307']
since you were, what, 14?:::['7-6-308']
no, i was 10. i just developed early.:::['7-6-309']
man alive!:::['7-6-310']
hey, what's going on? hey!:::['7-6-311']
we decided rachel is going to be your maid of honor.:::['7-6-312']
oh, wow. okay, we really have to start planning.:::['7-6-314']
i have really specific ideas.:::['7-6-315']
we should meet four times a week.:::['7-6-316']
come to my place, we'll get together before work.:::['7-6-317']
what do you say, 6:30, my place? so excited!:::['7-6-318']
yeah, okay. you laugh now.:::['7-6-319']
she's gonna be yours.:::['7-6-320']
great nap.:::['7-6-321']
dude, what the hell are you doing?:::['7-6-323']
morning. hi.:::['7-7-0']
how was your date?:::['7-7-1', '3-11-355']
pretty good. oh, good.:::['7-7-2']
aah! my god. sorry about that.:::['7-7-3']
okay, really good.:::['7-7-4']
i gotta go. i'm late.:::['7-7-5']
you're going to leave her with me?:::['7-7-6']
don't worry, she's a terrific girl.:::['7-7-7']
can you do me a favor?:::['7-7-8', '5-23-2']
could you mention i'm not looking for a relationship? that'd be great.:::['7-7-9']
what, are you kidding?:::['7-7-10']
just casually slip it in, you know. lay the groundwork.:::['7-7-11']
tell her i'm a loner. no, an outlaw.:::['7-7-12']
she doesn't want to get mixed up with the likes of me.:::['7-7-13']
that's a lot to remember.:::['7-7-14']
can't i tell her that you're a pig?:::['7-7-15']
i'm gonna call her later myself.:::['7-7-16']
honest.:::['7-7-17']
chandler used to do it. he'd make her pancakes.:::['7-7-18']
he'd make extras and leave them for me.:::['7-7-19']
i'm not telling her anything. it's not my responsibility.:::['7-7-20']
now, where did we land on those pancakes?:::['7-7-22']
sorry, but i couldn't get that lock to work.:::['7-7-24']
yeah, joey kind of disabled it when i moved in.:::['7-7-25']
you must be rachel. i'm erin. hi.:::['7-7-26']
i don't mean this to sound like high school, but did he talk about me?:::['7-7-27']
would you like some pancakes?:::['7-7-28']
chandler: come on. why are we here? ross: okay, okay, take a guess.:::['7-7-29']
the hot chicks?:::['7-7-30']
okay, okay, i was typing names into the library computer earlier......you know, for fun.:::['7-7-31']
and i typed mine in, and guess what came up?:::['7-7-32']
my doctoral dissertation.:::['7-7-33']
it's right down here in the biggest library in the university.:::['7-7-34']
wow, that's actually pretty cool.:::['7-7-35']
there's also a book here by a woman named wendy bagina.:::['7-7-36']
what is that?:::['7-7-37', '7-15-102', '5-3-238', '3-12-127']
sounds like two people are really enjoying the dewey decimal system.:::['7-7-38']
woman: we're so sorry.:::['7-7-39']
you didn't bring me here to do that, did you?:::['7-7-40']
she sent the chicken back again?:::['7-7-41']
she said it's too dry and wants to explain to you how she wants it.:::['7-7-42']
i'd like to meet this chicken expert.:::['7-7-43']
send the colonel in.:::['7-7-44']
lucky bastard.:::['7-7-46', '10-16-233']
janice. how are you......ms. hotshot-chef-at-the-big-fancy-:::['7-7-47']
restaurant-with-the-best-chicken-ever?:::['7-7-48']
oh, what is that on your finger? i'm blind.:::['7-7-50']
oh, uh...:::['7-7-51', '10-13-173', '2-13-92', '5-10-48', '5-15-69', '4-5-161']
so who's the lucky guy?:::['7-7-52']
i am so sorry, sweetie.:::['7-7-54']
you didn't tell her we're engaged?:::['7-7-56']
she saw the ring. did she freak out?:::['7-7-57']
she was shocked, but then again, so were most people.:::['7-7-58']
she actually has a boyfriend herself.:::['7-7-60']
name's clark.:::['7-7-61']
she also invited herself to our wedding.:::['7-7-62']
clark too.:::['7-7-63']
you said no, right?:::['7-7-64', '7-7-66']
she cornered me. she asked me if the wedding was in town.:::['7-7-67']
what was i supposed to do? lie.:::['7-7-68']
how hard is that? "your check's in the mail.":::['7-7-69']
"oh, your baby's so cute.":::['7-7-70']
"i can't wait to read your book, ross.":::['7-7-71']
so she comes to the wedding. maybe it won't be so bad.:::['7-7-72']
think she'll sit quietly? think she'll want to make a toast?:::['7-7-73']
you don't think she'll want to sing "part-time lover"?:::['7-7-74']
oh, my god. she's not gonna like the chicken either, is she?:::['7-7-75']
you know what? it'll be okay.:::['7-7-76']
she's probably not gonna even want to come.:::['7-7-77']
really? no, that was a lie.:::['7-7-78']
see how easy that was?:::['7-7-79']
so you would have just lied?:::['7-7-80']
it would have really been that easy? yes.:::['7-7-82']
do it saturday. we're having dinner with her and clark.:::['7-7-83']
hey, what's up?:::['7-7-84', '5-22-95', '5-1-92']
hey, who's your friend?:::['7-7-86']
hey, joey. joey: erin.:::['7-7-88']
you're still here.:::['7-7-89']
we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time.:::['7-7-90']
why wouldn't you? erin is great.:::['7-7-91']
and then there's you guys.:::['7-7-92']
well, listen, i better get going.:::['7-7-93']
today was great. thanks. rachel: i know.:::['7-7-94']
and joey, last night was fun.:::['7-7-96']
yeah. i'll call you.:::['7-7-97']
i'll call you too. or i'll call you.:::['7-7-98']
and call me. erin: okay.:::['7-7-99']
good to see you again. bye.:::['7-7-100']
joey: bye-bye. rachel: bye.:::['7-7-101']
the system kind of broke down, huh?:::['7-7-102']
joey, i'm sorry. i just couldn't tell her all those things.:::['7-7-103']
and we got to talking, and i...:::['7-7-104']
we want you to marry her.:::['7-7-105']
she is so amazing. you have no idea.:::['7-7-107']
who do you think brought her here?:::['7-7-108']
cupid.:::['7-7-109']
she's so cool. she speaks four languages.:::['7-7-110']
man, do you know what guys want.:::['7-7-111']
come on, she's so perfect for you. she's sweet.:::['7-7-112']
she likes baseball. she had two beers at lunch.:::['7-7-113']
my beers?!:::['7-7-114']
look, she's a very nice girl.:::['7-7-115']
we had a very good time, but i don't see it going anywhere.:::['7-7-116']
you always say that.:::['7-7-117']
maybe if you gave her a chance, it would go somewhere.:::['7-7-118']
i'm sorry, you guys. i just don't think so.:::['7-7-119']
whatever. fine.:::['7-7-120']
hey, don't start judging me.:::['7-7-121']
you're in love with your assistant.:::['7-7-122']
you're sleeping with the guy who keeps pigeons on the roof.:::['7-7-123']
secret affair.:::['7-7-125']
people are doing it in front of my book.:::['7-7-126']
i'm sorry?:::['7-7-127', '7-2-210', '7-13-145', '5-7-304', '4-1-98']
my doctoral dissertation is in the library at school. i went to see it.:::['7-7-128']
and there were students making babies right in the paleontology section.:::['7-7-129']
oh, my god. did you get to see anything good?:::['7-7-130']
at your school......was there a place on campus:::['7-7-131']
where students went to fool around?:::['7-7-132']
yeah, there was.:::['7-7-133']
in the corner of the library where all the books were that nobody ever read.:::['7-7-134']
yes, there was.:::['7-7-135']
great, because people kept showing up. i think it's like a thing.:::['7-7-136']
hold on a second.:::['7-7-137', '2-14-1']
fifth floor, against that back wall?:::['7-7-138']
oh, for crying out loud!:::['7-7-139']
so we should go catch our movie. what's the rush?:::['7-7-140']
i'd like to see the previews.:::['7-7-141']
the candy.:::['7-7-142']
oh, hey. rachel: well, look who's here.:::['7-7-143']
hey, joey. hey, erin.:::['7-7-144']
hey, rachel. hi.:::['7-7-145']
we were about to take off and see a movie.:::['7-7-146']
oh, no! what's wrong?:::['7-7-147']
phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.:::['7-7-148']
what party?:::['7-7-150']
a birthday party.:::['7-7-151']
whose birthday party?:::['7-7-152']
alison's birthday party.:::['7-7-153']
oh. and how old is alison?:::['7-7-154']
thirty-two.:::['7-7-155']
wait a minute. why don't you guys do something?:::['7-7-156']
look how that worked out.:::['7-7-157']
excuse me. hi, i'm a professor here.:::['7-7-158']
do you know the paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?:::['7-7-159']
well, yes. just give me five minutes.:::['7-7-160']
i just have to find someone to cover my shift.:::['7-7-161']
can i speak to someone in charge?:::['7-7-163']
how can i help?:::['7-7-164']
hi, i was wondering, is it possible to increase security......in the paleontology section?:::['7-7-165']
i wrote a book that's up there.:::['7-7-166']
and instead of reading it, people are...:::['7-7-167']
well, they're rolling around in front of it.:::['7-7-168']
we are aware of the problem you're referring to.:::['7-7-169']
as far as increasing security, i'm afraid the library's understaffed.:::['7-7-170']
i can't help you.:::['7-7-171']
well, fine.:::['7-7-172', '5-24-59']
if i'm the only person with any appreciation......of the sanctity of the written word,then i'll go defend it myself.:::['7-7-173']
don't you follow me.:::['7-7-174']
hey. phoebe & rachel: hey.:::['7-7-175']
how did it go with erin? unbelievable.:::['7-7-176']
we had the best time.:::['7-7-177']
so you're not mad anymore? no, no. you guys were totally right.:::['7-7-179']
this was much better than the first date.:::['7-7-180']
it was awkward. we were both nervous.:::['7-7-181']
didn't you sleep together? yeah, that calms me down.:::['7-7-182']
and we have so much in common.:::['7-7-183']
she loves sandwiches, sports. although she is a met fan.:::['7-7-184']
not an issue now, but if we had kids...:::['7-7-185']
oh, my god! listen to you talking about having kids.:::['7-7-186']
oh, my joey.:::['7-7-187']
please don't get married before i do. oh.:::['7-7-188']
i just cannot believe that clark stood me up.:::['7-7-190']
he may still show up.:::['7-7-191']
what are you, stupid?:::['7-7-192']
it's been three hours. is that all?:::['7-7-193']
let's go on to happier things.:::['7-7-194']
why don't you tell me about your lovely wedding?:::['7-7-195']
there was something that we wanted to tell you about the wedding.:::['7-7-196']
it's going to be a small ceremony.:::['7-7-197']
tiny.:::['7-7-198']
we're not even sure why we're having it.:::['7-7-199']
it's actually going to be just family.:::['7-7-200']
oh, wait.:::['7-7-201', '2-12-36', '2-6-254', '3-5-234']
you two think of me as family?:::['7-7-202']
i have to ask you something now, and be honest.:::['7-7-203']
do you want me to sing "careless whisper" or "lady in red"?:::['7-7-204']
how can you say that? the mets have no closer.:::['7-7-205']
what about benitez? what about game one of the series?:::['7-7-206']
what about shut up? you shut up.:::['7-7-207']
i love arguing with her.:::['7-7-208']
be right back. okay.:::['7-7-209']
how's it going with joey?:::['7-7-210']
tell me that you like him, please. i mean, tell me that you like him.:::['7-7-213']
he's a really great guy, and i know you really want this to work out......but i just don't see this having a future.:::['7-7-214']
but you said that you liked him. what happened?:::['7-7-216']
did you just change your mind?:::['7-7-217']
kind of. then change it back!:::['7-7-218']
i'm sorry. it's just there's no real spark.:::['7-7-219']
didn't you sleep together?:::['7-7-220']
tramp.:::['7-7-222']
does joey have any idea?:::['7-7-223']
i don't think he does. you know what?:::['7-7-224']
maybe you could tell him i'm not interested......in a serious relationship.:::['7-7-225']
you mean, like, that you're kind of a loner?:::['7-7-226']
yeah, that'd be great.:::['7-7-227']
and maybe that you're a real stronzo. i'm sorry?:::['7-7-228']
i guess italian isn't one of the four languages you speak.:::['7-7-229']
hey. want to go? yeah, let's go.:::['7-7-230']
okay. see you guys later. bye, guys.:::['7-7-231']
hey, thank you so much.:::['7-7-232']
i guess it wasn't cupid that brought her here.:::['7-7-234']
no, just a regular old flying dwarf.:::['7-7-235']
yes, yes. how can i help you?:::['7-7-236']
we were just looking around.:::['7-7-237']
oh, you're fellow scholars.:::['7-7-238']
what exactly were you looking for?:::['7-7-239']
perhaps... perhaps dr. chester stock's musings......on the smilodon californicus?:::['7-7-240']
uh... uh! uh!:::['7-7-241']
get out of here!:::['7-7-242']
meeting someone?:::['7-7-243']
or are you just here to brush up......on merriam's views on evolution?:::['7-7-244']
actually, i find merriam's views far too progressionist.:::['7-7-245']
i find merriam's views far too progressionist.:::['7-7-246']
i'm sorry. who are you?:::['7-7-247']
i'm a professor here. ross geller.:::['7-7-248']
ross geller? why do i know that name? it's a...:::['7-7-249']
did you write this?:::['7-7-251']
you're the person who checked out my book?:::['7-7-253']
you know, you look nothing like i would have thought.:::['7-7-254']
you're so young.:::['7-7-255']
well, i skipped fourth grade.:::['7-7-256']
i am very, very sorry.:::['7-7-257']
so how was your date? great. we walked around the village.:::['7-7-260']
we went to this ice cream place. split a milk shake.:::['7-7-261']
seventy-thirty, but still.:::['7-7-262']
i'm thinking of taking her upstate to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.:::['7-7-263']
really? she said she wants to go?:::['7-7-264']
no, it's a surprise. it's gonna be tricky, because she's busy at work.:::['7-7-265']
joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?:::['7-7-267']
i got the feeling from her......that she's not looking:::['7-7-269']
for a serious relationship.:::['7-7-270']
where are you getting this? she told me.:::['7-7-271']
she said she's kind of a loner.:::['7-7-272']
joey... hey, rach, it's cool, you know.:::['7-7-274']
i'm a loner too, right?:::['7-7-275']
hey, joey. you know what? you are way too good for her.:::['7-7-276']
i promise, next time i will tell them you're not looking for a relationship.:::['7-7-277']
no, don't do that. just...:::['7-7-279']
next time, make sure she likes me. well, that too.:::['7-7-280']
joey: yeah?:::['7-7-282']
do you want some pancakes? finally.:::['7-7-283']
i say we go with "careless whisper.":::['7-7-285']
did she see us yet? did she see us?:::['7-7-287']
janice, what are you doing here?:::['7-7-288']
i thought i was gonna go back to my apartment......but i just felt like i really:::['7-7-289']
couldn't be alone tonight.:::['7-7-290']
i was just wondering if i could maybe stay here with you.:::['7-7-291']
just i really feel like i need to be with family.:::['7-7-292']
our kids are gonna call her aunt janice, aren't they?:::['7-7-293']
please. because otherwise, i really don't know what i might do.:::['7-7-294']
aren't you just a teensy bit curious?:::['7-7-295']
you have any tissues? yeah, in the bathroom.:::['7-7-296']
we'll just let her stay.:::['7-7-297']
no. if we let her stay, she will stay forever.:::['7-7-298']
kind of like your barcalounger. is that what you're thinking about?:::['7-7-299']
i never stop thinking about it.:::['7-7-300']
do either one of you want to get in there before i take my bath?:::['7-7-302']
janice, i'm sorry......but you can't stay here tonight.:::['7-7-303']
honestly?:::['7-7-305']
our apartment is a hotbed......for electromagnetic activity.:::['7-7-306']
monica and i have been immunized, but sadly......you have not.:::['7-7-307']
i'm gonna need a comforter.:::['7-7-308']
do you have a hypoallergenic one? because otherwise i get very nasal.:::['7-7-309']
do you have a cat? because it's already happening.:::['7-7-310']
eh. do you hear that? listen.:::['7-7-311']
oh, my god! oh, my god! you have to go.:::['7-7-312']
because chandler still has feelings for you.:::['7-7-314']
he does?:::['7-7-315']
say again?:::['7-7-316']
that's right. that's right.:::['7-7-317']
and that is why you can't stay here tonight.:::['7-7-318']
and probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.:::['7-7-319']
feelings. such strong feelings.:::['7-7-320']
i mean, i realize that his feelings may never completely go away......but you can.:::['7-7-321']
i understand. i am so sorry.:::['7-7-323']
goodbye, monica.:::['7-7-325']
i wish you a lifetime of happiness with him.:::['7-7-326']
you call me when this goes in the pooper.:::['7-7-328']
i've got this section covered.:::['7-7-329']
yeah, in fact, i've got this baby to shine in people's eyes.:::['7-7-330']
i just wanted to show monica your book.:::['7-7-332']
what's the matter? someone on the subway licked my neck!:::['7-5-1']
licked my neck! whoa! willy's still alive.:::['7-5-2']
what are you doing? my mom called.:::['7-5-3']
they're gonna run our engagement announcement in the paper.:::['7-5-4']
we're looking for a good picture. ooh, i'm afraid that does not exist.:::['7-5-5']
not true. there are great pictures of us.:::['7-5-6']
no, there are great pictures of you next to a guy who's going like this...:::['7-5-7']
oh, my god, that's the creep that you're with at the statue of liberty.:::['7-5-8']
i don't know what it is. i just can't take a good picture.:::['7-5-9']
oh, here's a great one.:::['7-5-10']
yeah, i'm not in that. no, but look at me, all tan.:::['7-5-11']
why don't you get portraits done by a professional photographer?:::['7-5-12']
that's a great idea. i bet they have one of those wind machines, like::::['7-5-13']
yeah, that's great. next to that, chandler won't look so stupid.:::['7-5-14']
chandler, what do you say? all right, but i should warn you.:::['7-5-15']
i'm not going. i'm going.:::['7-5-16']
dude, that reverse lay-up. ugh!:::['7-5-17']
and how about those three-pointers? amazing.:::['7-5-18']
and those guys were this close to letting us play this time too.:::['7-5-19']
hey, look. phoebe's talking to cute coffeehouse guy.:::['7-5-20']
you call him "cute coffeehouse guy"? we call him "hums while he pees.":::['7-5-21']
yes, and we call ross "lingers in the bathroom.":::['7-5-22']
hey, you guys, "hums while he pees" just asked me out.:::['7-5-23']
i thought that guy was married. he is, but he's getting divorced.:::['7-5-24']
ross, maybe you know him.:::['7-5-25']
it's not a club.:::['7-5-26']
if this guy's going through a divorce, is it a good idea to go out with him?:::['7-5-27']
hey, divorced men are not bad men.:::['7-5-28']
they have that that on the napkins at the club.:::['7-5-29']
oh, i gotta get back to work. you don't have to be back for a half-hour.:::['7-5-30']
my assistant, tag, does sit-ups in the office during lunch. heh.:::['7-5-31']
ugh, i could just spread him on a cracker.:::['7-5-32']
if you have a crush on this guy, why would you hire him?:::['7-5-33']
you know you can't date him, right? oh, no, i know that.:::['7-5-34']
although we made a joke that we spend so much time together......he should call me his "work-wife.":::['7-5-35']
soon he'll be able to call you "that lady he knew that got fired.":::['7-5-36']
i'm not gonna get fired, because i'm not gonna act on it.:::['7-5-37']
you wouldn't mind if he was dating someone?:::['7-5-38']
why, is he? he is, isn't he? he's dating that slut in marketing.:::['7-5-39']
maybe i should open a divorced men's club.:::['7-5-40']
dude, that's so sad.:::['7-5-41']
i could put a basketball court in the back. heh.:::['7-5-42']
could i play?:::['7-5-43']
oh, no sit-ups today, tag?:::['7-5-44']
i just did them. oh, well, drop and give me 10 more. heh.:::['7-5-45']
i had a drink with lunch. did those, um...?:::['7-5-47']
did those cost reports come in? yeah, i filled them out last night.:::['7-5-48']
oh, great. could you make me 4 copies?:::['7-5-49']
sure. great, thank you.:::['7-5-50']
hey, rachel. hi. hi, melissa. what's up?:::['7-5-53']
i'm just about to, um, go out to the store.:::['7-5-54']
get some stuff to put in my backpack.:::['7-5-55']
you know, like dried fruit and granola, and stuff like that.:::['7-5-56']
um, what's up? is tag here?:::['7-5-57']
no. why? oh, i was gonna talk to him......about doing something tonight.:::['7-5-58']
you got a little crush on tag there, do you?:::['7-5-60']
well, we've been flirting back and forth......but i was hoping tonight it would:::['7-5-61']
turn into something a little more than that.:::['7-5-62']
okay, whoa, whoa. easy there, melissa. this ain't a locker room, okay.:::['7-5-63']
but you know, i remember him saying that he had plans tonight.:::['7-5-64']
oh, no. oh, yeah.:::['7-5-65']
all right, back to work.:::['7-5-66']
hey, isn't that tag's backpack?:::['7-5-67']
yeah, melissa, i don't want to be known as the, uh, office bitch......but i will call your supervisor.:::['7-5-68']
photographer: great, that's great, monica. great.:::['7-5-69']
now, chandler, you want to give us a smile?:::['7-5-70']
i'm sorry, is the seat uncomfortable? no, i am.:::['7-5-72']
chandler, i know you can do this. you have a beautiful smile.:::['7-5-73']
i do? yeah.:::['7-5-74']
all right, maybe you don't have to smile. let's try something else. let's try, um...:::['7-5-75']
try looking sexy. okay.:::['7-5-76']
hi, joey, what are you doing here?:::['7-5-78']
i got an audition down the street, and i spilled sauce all over my shirt.:::['7-5-79']
you got an extra one? yeah, sure. um...:::['7-5-80']
you got anything that's not ralph lauren?:::['7-5-83']
yeah, i don't think so, joe.:::['7-5-84']
i guess this'll be fine.:::['7-5-85']
listen, uh, what are you doing tonight? nothing. why?:::['7-5-86']
how would you feel about taking out my assistant tag?:::['7-5-87']
i'll pay. heh.:::['7-5-88']
it's gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.:::['7-5-89']
i'm not asking you to go on a date with him.:::['7-5-90']
really? because i could kind of use the money.:::['7-5-91']
joey, just... he's new in town and he doesn't have any guy friends.:::['7-5-92']
take him to a ball game or something. i'd appreciate it.:::['7-5-93']
yeah, okay, no problem. thank you.:::['7-5-94']
ooh, hey, doughnuts! uh-huh.:::['7-5-95']
i know. let's try a look......of far-off wonderment.:::['7-5-96']
gaze into our future and think about our marriage and the days to come.:::['7-5-97']
chandler, what is the matter with your face?:::['7-5-98']
this picture's supposed to say "geller and bing to be married"......not "local woman:::['7-5-99']
saves drowning moron.":::['7-5-100']
ha-ha-ha. monica: hey, don't laugh at him.:::['7-5-101']
he's my drowning moron.:::['7-5-102']
aw. that's it, that's it! take it, take it!:::['7-5-103']
i like this one.:::['7-5-104']
it seems to say, "i love you and that's why i have to kill you.":::['7-5-105']
can't all be bad.:::['7-5-106']
find the one where you make your bedroom eyes.:::['7-5-107']
oh, my god, those are my bedroom eyes?:::['7-5-109']
why did you ever sleep with me?:::['7-5-110']
do you really want to pull at that thread?:::['7-5-111']
i'm having a really good time. me too.:::['7-5-112']
sorry that guy on the subway licked your neck.:::['7-5-113']
no, that's okay. he's a friend.:::['7-5-115']
uh, i don't mean to be presumptuous......but i have tickets to the:::['7-5-116']
ballroom-dancing finals tomorrow.:::['7-5-117']
yeah, i...:::['7-5-118', '7-1-92']
well, i missed the semifinals, so i think i would just be lost.:::['7-5-119']
heh, i know that it's lame, but i got these tickets from my boss...:::['7-5-120']
oh, no, no, no, my god!:::['7-5-121']
okay, don't freak out. i'll go. no, it's...:::['7-5-122']
my ex-wife whitney is out there.:::['7-5-123']
i cannot deal with her now. that woman is crazy.:::['7-5-124']
okay, i know. hold on.:::['7-5-125']
hey, ross. yeah.:::['7-5-126', '5-12-15']
yeah. um, that's whitney, kyle's ex-wife out there.:::['7-5-127']
do you think you could divert her so we could slip out?:::['7-5-128']
okay, but i have two tickets to the ballroom-dance finals.:::['7-5-130']
i don't think so, pheebs. i, heh...:::['7-5-131']
but just because you're a friend. okay.:::['7-5-133']
hi, ginger.:::['7-5-135']
i want my key back.:::['7-5-136']
i don't have it. it's right there.:::['7-5-137']
ugh. okay, sherlock.:::['7-5-138']
i'm sorry, but you'd better go, pheebs.:::['7-5-139']
all right. i just wanted to thank you for diverting kyle's ex.:::['7-5-140']
oh, yeah, no, you're welcome. we'll, uh, talk about it later.:::['7-5-141']
hi, whitney. hi, ross.:::['7-5-143']
are you ready for breakfast? yep. ooh.:::['7-5-144']
kyle's ex-wife? you were supposed to divert her, not date her.:::['7-5-145']
sorry, can you give me a second while i talk to this woman......uh, who, by the way,did not spend the night?:::['7-5-146']
sure. okay. eh, heh...:::['7-5-147']
i did divert her, and we ended up having a great time, okay?:::['7-5-148']
watching ballroom dancing? yes.:::['7-5-149']
that's where we realized we are both super cool people.:::['7-5-150']
look, okay, ross. kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.:::['7-5-151']
like what? like she's really mean.:::['7-5-152']
and she's overly critical and... and... no.:::['7-5-153']
she will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you.:::['7-5-154']
and she uses sex as a weapon.:::['7-5-156']
fine. thank you for warning me.:::['7-5-157']
at breakfast, i'll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.:::['7-5-158']
you're still gonna go out with her? yeah.:::['7-5-159']
well, didn't you hear what i just said?:::['7-5-160']
pheebs, come on. i mean, consider the source.:::['7-5-161']
of course her ex-husband's gonna say that stuff. now if you'll excuse me.:::['7-5-162']
no, listen to me, she is crazy!:::['7-5-163']
whitney: uh, your door isn't soundproof.:::['7-5-164']
you see? nothing is good enough for her.:::['7-5-165']
morning. hi, tag.:::['7-5-166']
hey, so did you have fun with, uh, joey last night?:::['7-5-167']
yeah, we went to the knicks game.:::['7-5-168']
aw, that's nice.:::['7-5-169']
then we went to this bar, and he hooked us up with all these women.:::['7-5-170']
women? you mean, like old women?:::['7-5-171']
kind of old, like 30.:::['7-5-172']
oh. i never used to be able......to just talk to girls in bars......but i got, like, 20 phone numbers:::['7-5-173']
last night.:::['7-5-174']
oh, man. so joey must have really taught you some stuff.:::['7-5-176']
a little. yeah.:::['7-5-177']
see? that's a great smile. easy, natural.:::['7-5-179']
now pretend i have a camera.:::['7-5-180']
you're changing it. i can't help it.:::['7-5-181']
all right. you want to know what i do when i take résumé shots?:::['7-5-182']
borrow money from me?:::['7-5-183']
yeah. okay, first of all, you want to make it look spontaneous.:::['7-5-184']
so here's what i do. i look down, look down, keep looking down.:::['7-5-185']
then i look up.:::['7-5-186']
see? all right, now you try.:::['7-5-187']
look down. you're looking down. keep looking down.:::['7-5-188']
why is there jelly on your shoe?:::['7-5-189']
i had a doughnut. oh.:::['7-5-190']
so, i heard you had some fun with tag last night.:::['7-5-192']
yeah, that guy's all right.:::['7-5-193']
yeah, and you had fun teaching him how to be all "joey.":::['7-5-194']
what? you know, all the women.:::['7-5-195']
you can't teach someone to be good with women.:::['7-5-196']
that's why i never had any luck with chandler.:::['7-5-197']
i'm right here.:::['7-5-198']
would you mind just not going out with him again?:::['7-5-199']
just the idea of you and he and all these women...:::['7-5-200']
i know he's my assistant, and i can't date him, blah!:::['7-5-201']
but it bothers me, all right?:::['7-5-202']
no, no, no, you can't take him away from me.:::['7-5-203']
i got a great partner to pick up girls with. finally!:::['7-5-204']
i'm still right here.:::['7-5-205']
all right, will you talk to him......and tell him how hollow and unsatisfying:::['7-5-206']
this dating-tons-of-women thing is?:::['7-5-207']
i don't want him to meet anybody until i'm over my crush.:::['7-5-209']
and i will get over it.:::['7-5-210']
it's not like i love him. it's just physical.:::['7-5-211']
i get these crushes all the time. hell, i had a crush on you when i met you.:::['7-5-212']
i know. monica told me.:::['7-5-213']
did you have a crush on me when you first met me?:::['7-5-214']
can you people not see me?:::['7-5-216']
so will you talk to him?:::['7-5-217']
i don't know, rach. i'll give you 10 ralph lauren shirts.:::['7-5-218']
one.:::['7-5-219']
no, 10. you said 10. you can't take that back.:::['7-5-220']
hey. you wanted to talk to me?:::['7-5-221']
i don't know. you, uh, got something for me?:::['7-5-222']
oh, yeah, this is from rachel.:::['7-5-223']
ten. okay.:::['7-5-224']
tag, there's such a thing as too many women.:::['7-5-225']
really? yeah, for you.:::['7-5-226']
hey, there you are. there i am.:::['7-5-227']
you okay? yeah, joey said i, uh, needed to relax.:::['7-5-228']
so he gave me an antihistamine.:::['7-5-229']
then i fell asleep on the subway and went to brooklyn.:::['7-5-231']
brooklyn is far.:::['7-5-232']
but don't worry, because i know how to take a picture now.:::['7-5-234']
okay, see. look down.:::['7-5-235']
look down.:::['7-5-236', '2-15-191']
chandler? yeah?:::['7-5-237']
so how are things going with crazy? has she cooked your rabbit yet?:::['7-5-239']
listen, you are hearing one side of the story. okay?:::['7-5-240']
fyi, she must have shown kyle over 30 paint samples......before she painted that room.:::['7-5-241']
and his response to each one was, "i don't give a tiny rat's ass.":::['7-5-242']
maybe she should have spent a little less time decorating......and a little more time:::['7-5-243']
in the bedroom.:::['7-5-244']
i don't think we are going to have that problem......but maybe that's because i am not:::['7-5-245']
emotionally unavailable.:::['7-5-246']
you think he's emotionally unavailable?:::['7-5-247']
i think he can be.:::['7-5-248']
maybe he wouldn't be......if she didn't bring the office:::['7-5-249']
home every night.:::['7-5-250']
well excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life.:::['7-5-251']
well, she certainly knew what she was doing new year's eve 1997.:::['7-5-252']
i knew you were gonna throw that in my face!:::['7-5-253']
that was three years ago. she apologized and apologized.:::['7-5-254']
what more do you want?:::['7-5-255']
we want the last six years back!:::['7-5-256']
so do we! so do we!:::['7-5-257']
i'm sorry you had to see that.:::['7-5-258']

it's just not really who i am.:::['7-5-266']

why am i telling you this?:::['7-5-268']
you don't care about this stuff. yes, i do. i do.:::['7-5-269']

when i'm in a relationship.:::['7-5-271']
i love having a girlfriend. really?:::['7-5-272']
yeah. someone i can spoil, you know.:::['7-5-273']
sp... spoil? uh-huh.:::['7-5-274']
let me ask you something. uh-huh?:::['7-5-275']
do you believe there's one perfect person for everyone?:::['7-5-276']
i'm starting to.:::['7-5-277']
if that person's in your life, you should do something about it?:::['7-5-278']
yes. hell, yes.:::['7-5-279']
all right, then, it's settled. okay.:::['7-5-280']
i'm getting back together with my ex. i would love to!:::['7-5-281']
oh. this is gonna be a while. excuse me.:::['7-5-284']
oh, i'm sorry. is that annoying?:::['7-5-288']
and speaking of being selfish in bed, how's whitney?:::['7-5-289']
maybe she wouldn't have to be selfish in bed......if someone else knew where:::['7-5-290']
everything was.:::['7-5-291']
oh, he knows. heh.:::['7-5-292']
for the most part.:::['7-5-293']
oh, hey. good, you're both here.:::['7-5-294']
both of you together? what's up?:::['7-5-296']
well, i went over to kyle's last night to pick up a few things......and we got to reminiscing.:::['7-5-297']
kyle: we talked most of the night......and realized the reason:::['7-5-298']
we're angry with each other......is because there are still:::['7-5-299']
feelings there.:::['7-5-300']
oh, just say it, kyle!:::['7-5-302']
we're gonna give it another try.:::['7-5-303']
what about her whining, and her constant need for attention?:::['7-5-304']
i'm gonna work on that.:::['7-5-305']
oh, right, because you're so capable of change.:::['7-5-306']
you know, he hums when he pees.:::['7-5-307']
i do know. makes him miss the bowl, but whatever.:::['7-5-308']
we're so sorry.:::['7-5-309', '5-9-161']
that's all right. we don't need you. i'm over it already.:::['7-5-310']
yeah, and i don't even give a tiny rat's ass.:::['7-5-311']
yeah, we're gonna go.:::['7-5-312']
pheebs, you were right about her.:::['7-5-315']
you know, she did try to use sex as a weapon.:::['7-5-316']
yeah, i hurt my back a little.:::['7-5-317']
you know, he hums while he does other stuff too.:::['7-5-318']
we're better off without them. heh.:::['7-5-319']
even if they break up again, you better not let him in your sad men's club.:::['7-5-320']
divorced men's club. potato, "potato.":::['7-5-321']
hey, guys, check it out.:::['7-5-322']
my mom sent me the paper. ooh, let's see it. yay.:::['7-5-323']
oh, yeah, that looks good. you make a very attractive couple.:::['7-5-324']
yeah, we look great together. we really do.:::['7-5-325']
imagine what our kids would look like.:::['7-5-327']
you know, we don't have to imagine.:::['7-5-328']
i'm marrying her.:::['7-5-329']
we'll just see.:::['7-5-330']
we learned one thing, c.h.e.e.s.e::::['7-4-0']
cheerleaders and high explosives don't mix.:::['7-4-1']
you can say that again, mac.:::['7-4-2']
i couldn't have done it alone. you're a genius.:::['7-4-3']
oh, yeah? well, how come i can't get my vcr to stop blinking 12:00?:::['7-4-4']

joey: ma, so what did you think?:::['7-4-9']
well......that was, um, okay.:::['7-4-10']
it wasn't the best.:::['7-4-11']
that was one of the worst things ever......and not just on tv.:::['7-4-12']
what should we say? the lighting was okay.:::['7-4-13']
you got lighting last time. lighting is mine.:::['7-4-14']
i have costumes.:::['7-4-15']

"so we were watching you in there, and you were sitting right here. whoa.":::['7-4-17']
what about you? i don't know.:::['7-4-18']
i can't lie to him again. oh, no, i... no.:::['7-4-19']
i'm just gonna press my breasts up against him.:::['7-4-20']
and say nothing? uh-huh, yeah, that's right.:::['7-4-21']
wow, my folks really liked it.:::['7-4-22']
it wasn't that good.:::['7-4-24']
do you think that your favorite animal says much about you?:::['7-4-25']
you mean behind my back?:::['7-4-26']
oh, you'll never believe what happened to me today.:::['7-4-27']
i am sitting in my office... joey: you guys!:::['7-4-28']

at t.g.i. friday's.:::['7-4-80']
it's lame, i know.:::['7-4-81']
but i'm a goal-oriented person, eager to learn...:::['7-4-82']
just hold on a second, please.:::['7-4-83']
it's for human resources. everybody has to. would you stand up?:::['7-4-84']
ha, ha, no, no, no.:::['7-4-85']
hey. shh, shh, shh.:::['7-4-86', '4-23-235']
anyway, i should go. okay. bye.:::['7-4-87']
hey, sweetie. hi, sweetie.:::['7-4-88']
what was with all the whispering?:::['7-4-89']
i can't tell you. it's a secret.:::['7-4-90']
secret? married people aren't supposed to have secrets.:::['7-4-91']
we love and respect one another too much.:::['7-4-92']
but still, no, ha, ha.:::['7-4-94']
we should tell each other everything. i don't have secrets from you.:::['7-4-95']
really? so tell me what happened to ross, junior year at disneyland.:::['7-4-96']
no, i can't do that.:::['7-4-97']
i'll tell you what phoebe said.:::['7-4-98']
so, ahem, ross and i are going to disneyland.:::['7-4-100']
we stop at this restaurant for tacos.:::['7-4-101']
when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car.:::['7-4-102']
so ross has about ten tacos.:::['7-4-103']
anyway, we're on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy.:::['7-4-104']
oh, my god. he threw up?:::['7-4-105']
no, he visited a town a little south of throw up.:::['7-4-106']
what was phoebe's secret?:::['7-4-108']
um, nancy thompson, from phoebe's old massage place, is getting fired.:::['7-4-109']
that's it? i gave up my disneyland story for that?:::['7-4-111']
hm, that's right. you lose, sucker!:::['7-4-112']
please still marry me.:::['7-4-113']
you have an assistant, right?:::['7-4-114']
did she call?:::['7-4-115', '4-13-219']
you told her i was sick, right? always tell her i am sick.:::['7-4-116']
i don't know. how do you decide who to hire?:::['7-4-117']
i have it down to two people.:::['7-4-118']
one has great references and a lot of experience.:::['7-4-119']
and then, there's this guy. what about him?:::['7-4-120']
i love him.:::['7-4-121']
he's so pretty, i want to cry.:::['7-4-122']
i don't know what to do.:::['7-4-123', '2-11-261']
come on, you know what to do. you hire the first one.:::['7-4-124']
don't hire assistants because they're cute. do it because they're qualified.:::['7-4-125']
i hear you. you make a lot of sense. can i just say one more thing?:::['7-4-127']
look how pretty.:::['7-4-128']
oh. but, no.:::['7-4-131']
no. you can't... you can't hire him because it's not professional.:::['7-4-132']
um, this is for me, yes?:::['7-4-133']
okay, you're right. i'll hire hilda tomorrow.:::['7-4-134']
dumb, old, perfect-for-the-job hilda.:::['7-4-135']
wo-ha-ow!:::['7-4-137']
don't show this to monica.:::['7-4-138']
and don't tell her about the "wo-ha-ow!":::['7-4-139']
ha, ha, hey, joey. hey, terry.:::['7-4-140']
nice to see you again. been a while.:::['7-4-141']

it's a different building.:::['7-4-143']
so......stryker ramoray, huh?:::['7-4-144']
when do i start? how about right now?:::['7-4-145']
here are the audition scenes.:::['7-4-147']
i thought you were offering me the part.:::['7-4-148']
i was doctor drake ramoray, stryker's twin brother.:::['7-4-150']
who looks more like me than me, right?:::['7-4-151']
everybody has to audition. ha, ha.:::['7-4-152']
you know, terry, i don't really need to do this.:::['7-4-153']
i got my own cable tv series......with a robot.:::['7-4-154']
i'm sorry, joey. that's the way it is.:::['7-4-155']
well......i guess you think:::['7-4-156']
you're pretty special, huh?:::['7-4-157']
sitting up here in your fancy, small-halled building......making stars jump:::['7-4-158']
through hoops for you, huh?:::['7-4-159']
well, you know what?:::['7-4-160']
this is one star whose hoop...:::['7-4-161']
this is the star the hoop... this hoop...:::['7-4-162']
i was doctor drake ramoray!:::['7-4-163']
i came to thank you for not laughing in my face yesterday.:::['7-4-165']
i noticed there were no plants so i brought you your first.:::['7-4-166']
there is a plant in your office.:::['7-4-167']
so i guess i shouldn't put "good at noticing stuff" on my résumé.:::['7-4-170']
thank you. anyway......i'm guessing you hired somebody.:::['7-4-172']
thanks again for meeting with me.:::['7-4-175']
but i hired you.:::['7-4-176']
what? yeah, you got the job.:::['7-4-177']
you're my new assistant. i am?:::['7-4-178']
i can't believe it. ha, ha, me either.:::['7-4-180']
first, i need you to go downstairs......find a woman named hilda,and tell her to go home.:::['7-4-181']
hey. hey, good, you're home.:::['7-4-182']
always nicer to hear than, "oh, crap, you again.":::['7-4-183']
hey, sweetie, i made you a surprise.:::['7-4-184']
oh, yeah? yeah, tacos.:::['7-4-185']
ever since that story, i've had such a craving.:::['7-4-186']
did you not understand the story?:::['7-4-187']
ah, nothing. just figuring out what to do for dinner.:::['7-4-189']
hey, ooh, what's that? dinner stuff? you making dinner? no.:::['7-4-190']
chandler: shh!:::['7-4-191']
what's over there? tacos?:::['7-4-192']
they're just, uh... they're... they're ground beef smileys.:::['7-4-194']
uh, those are tacos.:::['7-4-195']
excuse me, mr. mexico.:::['7-4-196']
either way, i'll pass. still can't eat those.:::['7-4-197']
what's so funny?:::['7-4-199', '4-16-98', '3-18-0']
i'm not laughing.:::['7-4-200']
you told her!:::['7-4-201']
nancy thompson's getting fired.:::['7-4-202']
okay, okay. i had food poisoning. it's not like i chose to do it!:::['7-4-203']
it's not like i said, "what would make this ride more fun?":::['7-4-204']
right. you're right, i'm sorry. i shouldn't be laughing.:::['7-4-205']
i should be laying down papers for you.:::['7-4-206']
how could you? i had to. we're getting married.:::['7-4-207']
married couples can't keep secrets.:::['7-4-208']
i... i guess monica should know about atlantic city.:::['7-4-209']
du... ude!:::['7-4-210']
what happened? chandler and i are in a bar...:::['7-4-211']
did you not hear me say, "du... ude"?:::['7-4-212']
and this girl is making eyes at chandler.:::['7-4-213']
so he goes over to her and, uh, after a minute or two, i see them kissing.:::['7-4-214']
you're thinking he's not the type to go to bars and make out with girls.:::['7-4-215']
and you're right. he's not the type......to go to bars:::['7-4-216']
and make out with "girls.":::['7-4-217']
you kissed a guy?:::['7-4-218']
in my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.:::['7-4-220']
oh, mon, i laughed so hard...:::['7-4-221']
ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?:::['7-4-222']
whatever, dude. you kissed a guy.:::['7-4-223', '7-4-261']
how's hilda working out?:::['7-4-225']
oh, my new assistant is working out. yes.:::['7-4-226']
she happy she got the job?:::['7-4-227']
my new assistant is very happy that i hired my new assistant.:::['7-4-228']
oh, hey! can you hang on a second?:::['7-4-230']
it's the producers at mac and c.h.e.e.s. e... ...if you'll excuse me for a minute.:::['7-4-231']
hey, funny you should call. i was just looking over next week's script.:::['7-4-232']

all right, i'll see you monday.:::['7-4-235']
we're not even shooting them anymore!:::['7-4-236']
all right. bye.:::['7-4-237']
they canceled mac and c.h.e.e.s.e.:::['7-4-238']
oh, sorry. oh, sorry, joey.:::['7-4-239']
why would they do that? it was a good show, right?:::['7-4-240']
you want to tell secrets? okay, in college......ross used to wear leg warmers.:::['7-4-241']
all right, chandler entered a vanilla ice look-alike contest and won.:::['7-4-242']
ross came in fourth and cried!:::['7-4-243']
oh, is that funny? you find that funny?:::['7-4-245']
maybe chandler should know your secrets too.:::['7-4-246']
ha, ha. oh, i... i already told him everything.:::['7-4-247']
you shush!:::['7-4-248']
once, she was sent to bed without dinner......so she ate the macaroni off:::['7-4-249']
a jewelry box she'd made.:::['7-4-250']
ross stayed home every saturday night to watch golden girls.:::['7-4-251']
monica couldn't tell time until she was 13.:::['7-4-252']
it's hard for some people!:::['7-4-253']
of course it is.:::['7-4-254']
chandler wore my underwear to work!:::['7-4-256']
oh, i'm sorry, i couldn't think of any more for ross.:::['7-4-257']
in college, chandler got drunk......and slept with the lady:::['7-4-258']
who cleaned our dorm.:::['7-4-259']
that was you.:::['7-4-260']
how could this happen to me?:::['7-4-262']
yesterday, i had two tv shows. today, i got nothing.:::['7-4-263']
wait a minute, what happened to days ofour lives?:::['7-4-264']
uh, well, they might be a little mad at me over there.:::['7-4-265']
well, maybe i got a little upset, and maybe i told them where they could go.:::['7-4-267']
joey, why would you do that?:::['7-4-268']
because! they wanted me to audition.:::['7-4-269']
you, an actor? that's madness!:::['7-4-270']
rachel green's office.:::['7-4-271']

you should hear my phone number. okay.:::['7-4-281']
so you hired yourself a little treat, did you?:::['7-4-282']
i know how it looks, but i am telling you...:::['7-4-283']
you can't get involved with your assistant.:::['7-4-284']
i know that, and i know hiring him was not the smartest thing i've ever done.:::['7-4-285']
but, from now on, i swear this is strictly professional.:::['7-4-286']
yes. hey, rachel.:::['7-4-287']
rachel: hi.:::['7-4-288', '5-1-145', '3-23-26']

hey, terry.:::['7-4-291']
terry: joey tribbiani.:::['7-4-292']
surprised your big head could fit through our small halls.:::['7-4-293']
terry: i gotta go, joey. joey: wait, terry! look, uh...:::['7-4-294']
i'm really sorry about before.:::['7-4-295']
i was an idiot, thinking i'm too big to audition for you.:::['7-4-296']
give me another chance. i can't.:::['7-4-297']
wait, terry, please!:::['7-4-298']
look, i just lost my other job, okay?:::['7-4-299']
you have no idea how much i need this.:::['7-4-300']
please, help me out.:::['7-4-301']
for old times' sake.:::['7-4-302']
this guy's been in a coma for five years. it's hopeless.:::['7-4-303']
it's not. dr. stryker ramoray is a miracle worker.:::['7-4-304']
drake, it's your brother, stryker. can you hear me?:::['7-4-307']
director: and cut.:::['7-4-308']
i'm back, baby!:::['7-4-309']
you know, in my defense, um......there was no glitter on:::['7-4-310']
the macaroni and very little glue.:::['7-4-311']
and in my defense, the cleaning lady came on to me.:::['7-4-312']
do you have trouble telling time now? no.:::['7-4-313']
quick, what time is it? time to kiss a guy?:::['7-4-314']
what are you laughing at, pampers?:::['7-4-315']
you know when i said married people......should share everything:::['7-4-316']
and not have any secrets?:::['7-4-317']
yeah? that was stupid. let's not do that.:::['7-4-318']
monica: oh.:::['7-4-319', '10-1-0']
we should keep the stuff we told each other secret from everyone else.:::['7-4-321']
chandler: ha, ha. yeah, definitely.:::['7-4-322']
okay, ha, ha.:::['7-4-323']
if you'll excuse me, i'm gonna hang out with people... ...who don't know the space mountain story.:::['7-4-324']
then i'd steer clear of phoebe. man!:::['7-4-325']
not that you would, but i wouldn't hang out with the guys at my office.:::['7-4-326']
do you have a minute? sure. what's up?:::['7-4-328']
i got asked out twice today while i was at lunch......by guys.:::['7-4-329']
really? tag: yeah.:::['7-4-330']
did you tell someone that i was gay?:::['7-4-331']
oh, did you not want people to know that?:::['7-4-332']
i'm not gay. i especially wouldn't want you to think i was gay.:::['7-4-333']
why is that?:::['7-4-334']
i don't think i should say. oh, you can say.:::['7-4-335']
come on, i don't want you to feel like you can't tell me things.:::['7-4-336']
well... yeah.:::['7-4-338', '10-16-225']
...i'd love to ask out your friend phoebe.:::['7-4-339']
yeah, she's gay.:::['7-4-340']
i found a note on my door, "come to monica's.:::['7-1-1']

yeah, i'll take that.:::['7-1-3']
monica and i are engaged. oh, my god.:::['7-1-5']

i'm getting married! i'm gonna be a bride!:::['7-1-11']

okay, to monica. group: to monica.:::['7-1-28']
have you decided on a band for the wedding, because i'm kind of musical.:::['7-1-29']
she got engaged a few hours ago, i doubt she's had time to think...:::['7-1-30']
speaking of chiming in, remember burning my apartment?:::['7-1-31']
yeah, you're on your own.:::['7-1-32']
we should get dressed up and go have champagne at the plaza.:::['7-1-33']
oh, okay! group: yeah.:::['7-1-34']
i can't stay too long.:::['7-1-35']
i gotta get up early for an audition. i gotta look good.:::['7-1-36']
i'm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.:::['7-1-37']
so when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?:::['7-1-39']
you guys don't think i look 19?:::['7-1-40']
oh, 19! we thought you said 90.:::['7-1-41']
okay, everybody, let's go. okay.:::['7-1-43']
is my candy bar around here?:::['7-1-44']
no, you ate it all.:::['7-1-45']
i was afraid of that.:::['7-1-46']
you know what shoes would look great with this ring?:::['7-1-47']
diamond shoes.:::['7-1-48']
you're not getting dressed.:::['7-1-49']
know what i mean?:::['7-1-50']
yeah, but i don't think we have time.:::['7-1-51']
there's gonna be a wedding.:::['7-1-52']
you're gonna be the bride.:::['7-1-53']
two hundred people are gonna be looking at you in a clean, white dress.:::['7-1-54']
let's do it.:::['7-1-55']
chandler, it happens to lots of guys.:::['7-1-56']
you're tired, you had a lot of champagne.:::['7-1-57']
don't worry about it.:::['7-1-58', '7-3-75']
i'm not worried. i'm fascinated.:::['7-1-59']
you know? it's like biology.:::['7-1-60']
which is funny, because in high school i failed biology......and tonight biology failed me.:::['7-1-61']
check it out. i could play this while the guests are coming in, okay.:::['7-1-62']
i thought he was gay:::['7-1-63']
but here i am singing on his wedding day:::['7-1-64']
phoebe, no.:::['7-1-65']
if you'd let me finish, it goes on to say that he's probably not gay.:::['7-1-66']
you guys don't have this problem, you're made of wood.:::['7-1-67']
hey, you look great. hey.:::['7-1-68']
you okay over there?:::['7-1-70']
i don't know. you know? i feel a little...:::['7-1-71']
you know what? never mind. i'll be fine.:::['7-1-72']
don't worry about it. you're probably tired, you had a lot of champagne.:::['7-1-73']
it happens to everybody.:::['7-1-74']
hey. wow. hi.:::['7-1-75']
happy monica's night. well, thank you. you too.:::['7-1-76']
can you believe they are actually getting married?:::['7-1-77']
well, sure, but i get married all the time.:::['7-1-78']
you okay? yeah, i guess.:::['7-1-79']
do you think we'll ever have that?:::['7-1-80']
you mean "we," you and me?:::['7-1-81']
"we," you with someone, me with someone.:::['7-1-83']
good, you scared me a minute.:::['7-1-84']
i know. shake it off.:::['7-1-85']
it's just because you and i, we were like a nightmare.:::['7-1-86']
no, but there were some good times. absolutely. like there was...:::['7-1-87']
surely you can think of something. just give me a minute.:::['7-1-88']
oh, well, yes.:::['7-1-89']
i can think of one good thing. what?:::['7-1-90']
you were always good at the......at the, uh, the stuff.:::['7-1-91']
i was good at the stuff?:::['7-1-93']
mm-hm. yup.:::['7-1-94']
i really liked your hands.:::['7-1-95']
my hands? yeah.:::['7-1-96']
yeah? uh-huh.:::['7-1-97']
way to go, guys.:::['7-1-98']
you were really good at the stuff too.:::['7-1-99']
hey, you know what we never did?:::['7-1-101']
oh, no, not that.:::['7-1-102']
we never had bonus night.:::['7-1-103']
a what? you know, bonus night.:::['7-1-104']
two people break up, but they get back together for one night.:::['7-1-105']
one night, just sex? no strings attached?:::['7-1-106']
yeah, yeah, we never had that. no. no.:::['7-1-107']
okay, this is getting a little crazy.:::['7-1-108']
um, i mean......i'm sure it would be amazing......but i really don't think:::['7-1-109']
it would be a good idea.:::['7-1-110']
i really......really......don't.:::['7-1-111']
what's up, dude?:::['7-1-113']
take whatever you want, just don't hurt me.:::['7-1-114']
you playing a little playstation, huh?:::['7-1-115']
that's wack.:::['7-1-116']
playstation is wack.:::['7-1-117']
what's up with the wack playstation, what's up?:::['7-1-118']
come on, am i 19 or what?:::['7-1-120']
yes, on a scale of one to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look......you are definitely 19.:::['7-1-121']
come on, really. how old?:::['7-1-122']
young. you're a man-child, okay?:::['7-1-123']
now get changed, everybody's ready. and please, please, keep my underwear.:::['7-1-124']
oh, thanks. okay.:::['7-1-125']
joe. yeah.:::['7-1-126']
uh.:::['7-1-127', '7-17-174', '2-6-89', '2-6-325', '3-1-262']
you've had a lot of sex, right?:::['7-1-128']
when, today?:::['7-1-129']
some, not a lot.:::['7-1-130']
the reason i'm asking is because i had kind of a, uh...:::['7-1-131']
i was unable to...:::['7-1-132']
i really wanted to, but i couldn't...:::['7-1-133']
there, ha, hm.:::['7-1-134']
there was an incident.:::['7-1-135']
don't worry about that, man. that happens.:::['7-1-136']
it's happened to you? yeah, once.:::['7-1-137']
well, what'd you do? i did it anyway.:::['7-1-138']
phoebe, come on, let's go.:::['7-1-139']
why aren't you dressed yet?:::['7-1-141']
i wrote the best song for your wedding.:::['7-1-142']
check this out. phoeb.:::['7-1-143']
if you get ready now, you can play.:::['7-1-144']
really?! yes.:::['7-1-145']
that's so exciting! thanks, mon.:::['7-1-146']
but if you touch my guitar again, i'll have to pound on you a little bit.:::['7-1-147']
fair enough. get ready. i'll get everybody.:::['7-1-148']
finally we can start celebrating my...:::['7-1-149']
i'm sorry, apparently i opened the door to the past.:::['7-1-150']
okay, monica, mon. okay, what you just saw...:::['7-1-151']
can i ask you just a little question? why tonight?:::['7-1-152']
what? i waited my whole life to be engaged.:::['7-1-153']
and unlike some, i only plan on doing this once.:::['7-1-154']
maybe it's selfish, i'm sorry, but i hoped tonight could just be about that.:::['7-1-155']
oh, honey, but it is. no, it's not.:::['7-1-156']
now it's about you getting back together.:::['7-1-157']
see, you kind of stole my thunder.:::['7-1-158']
we did not steal your thunder. we are not getting back together.:::['7-1-159']
yeah, no, and nobody even saw. yeah.:::['7-1-160']
we just kissed. ross: it was just a kiss.:::['7-1-162']
you guys kissed?:::['7-1-163']
are you back together? can i sing at your wedding?:::['7-1-165']
thunder being stolen.:::['7-1-166']
phoebe, it's nothing. let's not make a big deal of this.:::['7-1-167']
ross: it was a one-time thing. it doesn't even matter.:::['7-1-168']
i cannot believe you guys are talking about this.:::['7-1-170']
problems in the bedroom are between a man and woman.:::['7-1-171']
all right? now, chandler is doing the best he can.:::['7-1-172']
i don't think that's what they were talking about.:::['7-1-173']
what a great night. chandler can't do it, they kissed.:::['7-1-174']
what? you guys kissed? this is huge.:::['7-1-175']
no, it's not huge.:::['7-1-176']
people thinking it's huge has led monica to believe......we're stealing her thunder,which we aren't.:::['7-1-177']
we're still talking about it.:::['7-1-178']
that, and chandler's problem.:::['7-1-179']
monica, listen, listen.:::['7-1-180']
would you feel better if we stopped talking about ross and rachel?:::['7-1-181']
that would be lovely. you got it.:::['7-1-182']
now, i can pass for 19, right?:::['7-1-183']
yes, you can pass for 19.:::['7-1-184']
really? yes.:::['7-1-185', '10-9-161', '5-23-315', '5-22-270', '4-11-324']
seriously? seriously?:::['7-1-186']
seriously, no. okay? you can play your own age, which is 31.:::['7-1-187']
i'm 30!:::['7-1-188']
joey, you are not. you're 31.:::['7-1-189']
oh, crap!:::['7-1-190']
so, the plaza. we'll get some mai tais? maybe no more for you though.:::['7-1-191']
you know, i think i don't feel like going to the plaza.:::['7-1-192']
group: why? rachel: this is ridiculous.:::['7-1-193']
i don't want to talk about it. i don't. especially with you.:::['7-1-194']
pssh. that is wack.:::['7-1-195']
i'll play it at the wedding.:::['7-1-197']
yeah, well, we'll see if they actually let you play, huh?:::['7-1-198']
they tell you anything you want to hear......like, "you look 19.":::['7-1-199']
then they just take it away, like, "no, you don't.":::['7-1-200']
monica won't take this away.:::['7-1-201']
wouldn't she? would she?:::['7-1-202']
would she?:::['7-1-203']
you ate my candy bar!:::['7-1-204']
ross: guess who.:::['7-1-205']
hey, i just realized we kind of left some stuff up in the air.:::['7-1-207']
what did monica mean::::['7-1-208']
"i don't want to talk," especially with me?:::['7-1-209']
why not especially you and me? we were both kissing.:::['7-1-210']
still thinking about it?:::['7-1-211']
i'm serious. what did she mean by that? "especially you.":::['7-1-212']
oh, who cares? i care.:::['7-1-213']
and so do i.:::['7-1-214', '3-22-324']
i have to talk to her. will you let me get changed?:::['7-1-215']
okay, sure.:::['7-1-216']
am i going to let you watch me?:::['7-1-217']
i can't believe her. it's just so typical.:::['7-1-219']
i know you're upset, but don't forget there is going to be a wedding.:::['7-1-220']
you are going to throw the bouquet, and then a honeymoon.:::['7-1-221']
maybe in paris. paris?:::['7-1-222']
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la blah-blah-blah.:::['7-1-223']
keep talking.:::['7-1-224', '5-4-282']
we will sprinkle rose petals on the bed and make love......not just because it's romantic,but because i can.:::['7-1-225']
chandler: mmm.:::['7-1-227']
bonjour, monsieur.:::['7-1-228']
don't say anything, you might scare it away.:::['7-1-229']
it's paris. who knows we're here?:::['7-1-230']
hi, pheebs. what's up?:::['7-1-231']
you said i could sing at your wedding, so i need a small deposit.:::['7-1-232']
what? good-faith money to hold the date.:::['7-1-233']
we're not giving you a deposit for our wedding.:::['7-1-234']
oh, i see.:::['7-1-235', '10-9-220']
they break your heart, don't they?:::['7-1-236']
you know, i don't really need their permission.:::['7-1-237']
you want to sing at their wedding, sing at their wedding.:::['7-1-238']
yeah, and if you want to look 19, then you...:::['7-1-239']
you got to do something about your eyes.:::['7-1-240']
what's wrong with my eyes?:::['7-1-241']
they give you away. there's too much wisdom in there.:::['7-1-242']
put some tea bags on them for 15 minutes.:::['7-1-243']
that'll get rid of my wisdom? maybe 10 minutes for you.:::['7-1-244']
give her the deposit, give her the ring. i don't care.:::['7-1-245']
yes? what did you mean when you said......you didn't want to talk to anyone,especially me?:::['7-1-246']
what a great apology. and you accept it. bye-bye.:::['7-1-247']
no, seriously, what was the "especially me" part about?:::['7-1-248']
let's just say it's not the first time you've stolen my thunder.:::['7-1-249']
wha?:::['7-1-250']
hey, here's a thought...:::['7-1-251']
monica, what are you talking about?:::['7-1-252']
my sweet 16. you went to third base with my cousin charlie.:::['7-1-253']
ah, third base.:::['7-1-254']
it was all everybody could talk about.:::['7-1-255']
the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring.:::['7-1-256']
we had a caricaturist. oh.:::['7-1-257']
guess who won't be asked to sing:::['7-1-258']
somebody named geller and somebody else named bing:::['7-1-259']
monica, your sweet 16 was like a million years ago.:::['7-1-260']
yet here you are doing it again.:::['7-1-261']
oh, i don't want to steal your stupid thunder.:::['7-1-262']
why else would you have made out with ross?:::['7-1-263']
easy, mimey, the moment has passed. it ain't gonna happen.:::['7-1-265']
it'd be nice if i could have this night.:::['7-1-266']
i never wanted any part of your night.:::['7-1-267']
no one was supposed to see us.:::['7-1-268']
is that why you did it in the secret hallway, where nobody ever goes?:::['7-1-269']
uh, rachel, i've been thinking.:::['7-1-270']
i don't think us getting together tonight is such a good idea.:::['7-1-271']
i'm calling it off.:::['7-1-272']
way to save your dignity, my man.:::['7-1-273']
mon, why, why would i ever want to take away from your night?:::['7-1-274']
i don't know, maybe you feel a little resentful.:::['7-1-275']
maybe you thought you'd get married first.:::['7-1-276']
maybe you can't stand......that your formerly fat friend:::['7-1-277']
is getting married first.:::['7-1-278']
oh, wow, that... you know what? that is so unfair.:::['7-1-279']
now i want to steal your thunder.:::['7-1-280']
come on, ross. let's go have sex!:::['7-1-281']
i can't believe you're gonna have sex on my engagement night.:::['7-1-282']
well, somebody should.:::['7-1-283']
look, if we're gonna do this...:::['7-1-284']
we're not. she's just gonna think we are.:::['7-1-285']
i see, so everybody wins.:::['7-1-286']
who is it? monica: it's monica, open up.:::['7-1-287']
okay, ross, stop it. please, wait a minute.:::['7-1-288']
yeah, you like that, baby?:::['7-1-290']
i wanted to say i hope you have sex, and i hope you get back together.:::['7-1-292']
i warn you, the night you announce your engagement......i'm going to announce:::['7-1-293']
that i'm pregnant.:::['7-1-294']
how is that ever going to happen?:::['7-1-295']
do you want to know why i was with ross tonight?:::['7-1-296']
i know why. you don't.:::['7-1-297']
okay, why? because i was sad.:::['7-1-298']
look, i am so......so happy for you guys.:::['7-1-300']
but you getting married reminds me of the fact that i'm not.:::['7-1-301']
i'm not even close.:::['7-1-302']
maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better.:::['7-1-303']
i know that that's dumb, but you were so depressed......when ross got married,you slept with chandler.:::['7-1-304']
i don't care, she slept with me.:::['7-1-305']
anyway, sweetie, i am so sorry i ruined your night.:::['7-1-306']
i'm sorry i almost made you sleep with ross.:::['7-1-307']
i'm gonna take off.:::['7-1-308']
congratulations, man. thanks.:::['7-1-309']
and rachel. yeah.:::['7-1-310']
ross: what can i say?:::['7-1-311']
you missed your chance.:::['7-1-312']
from now on, the only person who's going to enjoy these bad boys is me.:::['7-1-313']
we thought phoebe would leave:::['7-1-314']
but she just stayed and stayed:::['7-1-315']
that's right, i'm here all night:::['7-1-316']
and chandler will never get...:::['7-1-317']
hey, here's a dollar.:::['7-1-318']
consider it a deposit. please sing at our wedding.:::['7-1-319']
oh, thank you. okay.:::['7-1-320']
now who will perform the ceremony?:::['7-1-321']
who will perform the cer...?:::['7-1-322']
i'll pound on him in the morning.:::['7-1-324']
hey, guys. rachel: hey.:::['7-3-0', '7-13-312']
about what? what?:::['7-3-2']
are you kidding? okay, i'll give you a hint. i'll give you a hint.:::['7-3-3']
eyes. no, no. your eyes! no.:::['7-3-4']
chandler's eyes!:::['7-3-5']
i got glasses.:::['7-3-6']
you always had glasses.:::['7-3-7']
didn't you used to have a pair? they were really round and burgundy, and they made you look kind of, um...:::['7-3-10']
feminine. yes!:::['7-3-11']
i think the glasses look great. they make you look sexy.:::['7-3-13']
you didn't think i used to wear glasses, right?:::['7-3-15']
of course. pfft. i had no idea.:::['7-3-16']
what do you want for an engagement present?:::['7-3-17']
oh, that's okay, we're not having a party......so you don't have to get us...:::['7-3-18']
ah, buh-buh-buh! heh.:::['7-3-19']
if someone wants to give us a present, we don't want to deprive them of that joy.:::['7-3-20']
oh, you should get them one of those little cd players.:::['7-3-21']
oh, i already have one.:::['7-3-22']
unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.:::['7-3-23']
yeah, and by "someone" she means joey.:::['7-3-24']
hey, i know what i want!:::['7-3-25']
what we want, honey. no, you don't want this.:::['7-3-26']
i want to have your grandmother's cookie recipe.:::['7-3-27']
you mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?:::['7-3-28']
uh-huh, yeah. the one my grandmother......made me swear on her deathbed......that i would never:::['7-3-29']
let out of our family?:::['7-3-30']
dying people say the craziest things.:::['7-3-31']
i've wanted it for years. i was gonna make cookies for my children.:::['7-3-32']
break my heart. oh, all right.:::['7-3-33']
i'll be the mom who makes the world's best chocolate chip cookies.:::['7-3-34']
our kids are gonna be fat, aren't they?:::['7-3-35']
ahoy! chandler: hey.:::['7-3-36']
how's the boat? i'm getting into this sailing stuff.:::['7-3-37']
you finally took it out of the marina?:::['7-3-38']
why would i do that?:::['7-3-39']
it took three guys to get the thing in there.:::['7-3-40']
if you don't sail it, what do you do on it?:::['7-3-41']
it's a great place to just kind of sit......hang around, drink a few beers,eat some chips.:::['7-3-42']
it's good that you finally have a place to do that.:::['7-3-43']
joey, i could teach you to sail if you want.:::['7-3-44']
you could? yeah, i've been sailing my whole life.:::['7-3-45']
when i was 15, my dad bought me my own boat.:::['7-3-46']
your own boat? he was trying to cheer me up.:::['7-3-47']
my pony was sick.:::['7-3-48']
you know what i was thinking? what?:::['7-3-49']
nothing, i just like to go like this.:::['7-3-50']
chandler, what are you doing tonight? why, do you have a lecture?:::['7-3-51']
no, why? then, free as a bird. what's up?:::['7-3-52']
uh, my dad wants to know if you want to play racquetball.:::['7-3-53']
wow, that's great! dad must like you.:::['7-3-54']
he doesn't ask just anyone to play. he didn't really ask for you.:::['7-3-55']
he asked for "chauncey." i assumed he meant you.:::['7-3-56']
did you correct him?:::['7-3-57']
no, i thought it would be more fun this way.:::['7-3-58']
maybe this is something you could do this every week.:::['7-3-59']
or you could sit on the porch......and make sure no one:::['7-3-60']
steals the trashcans.:::['7-3-61']
he does that every week too.:::['7-3-62']
just so you know, you have to let him win. he hates to lose.:::['7-3-63']
oh, no problem. maybe i'll play with my left hand.:::['7-3-64']
you're not a lefty?:::['7-3-65']
does anybody know me?:::['7-3-66']
what's wrong, phoebe?:::['7-3-67']
i just went to my old apartment to get you the cookie recipe......and that stupid fire burned it up!:::['7-3-68']
no! why didn't you make a copy and keep it in a fireproof box......and keep it at least 100 yards:::['7-3-69']
away from the original?:::['7-3-70']
because i'm normal.:::['7-3-71']
that was the one legacy my grandmother left me.:::['7-3-72']
and i know you wanted it as an engagement present.:::['7-3-73']
we have to get you an engagement present?:::['7-3-74']
no one got me an engagement present.:::['7-3-76']
okay, here. i don't have the recipe, but here.:::['7-3-77']
i wish you health and happiness.:::['7-3-78']
an old cookie?:::['7-3-79']
see, this is what happens when you don't register for gifts.:::['7-3-80']
i made a batch and i froze it. and this is the only one left.:::['7-3-81']
we can't accept this. why not?:::['7-3-82']
because it's gross.:::['7-3-83']
no, wait. i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie.:::['7-3-84']
i do this at work all the time.:::['7-3-85']
really? yeah, i think i can.:::['7-3-86']
oh, yay!:::['7-3-87', '2-18-194']
okay, ross, we owe you a present.:::['7-3-88']
two! i've been engaged twice.:::['7-3-89']
look at this clown.:::['7-3-90']
because he's got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river.:::['7-3-91']
that is the coast guard. what are they doing out here?:::['7-3-94']
the coast is all the way over there.:::['7-3-95']
joey, just ignore the boats.:::['7-3-96']
we're not finished with our lesson. all right.:::['7-3-97']
i'm gonna go over the basic points one more time.:::['7-3-98']
come on, rach. not again. i got it, okay? let's start sailing!:::['7-3-99']
i want to go over there where that boatload of girls is. yeah, oh!:::['7-3-100']
oh, is that what you wanna do?:::['7-3-101']
you want to give a shout out to the old hot chicas?:::['7-3-102']
okay, let's do that, sailor joe.:::['7-3-103']
quick question, though: what's this called?:::['7-3-104']
uh, boat rope? wrong.:::['7-3-105']
how do you get the mainsail up? uh...:::['7-3-106']
rub it?:::['7-3-107']
no. what do you do if i say we're coming about?:::['7-3-108']
i'd say, "come again?" ha, ha.:::['7-3-109']
no, no, i know this one. i know this one. uh, um...:::['7-3-110']
time's up. now you're dead.:::['7-3-111']
and deaf!:::['7-3-112']
okay, you go on and make your little jokes.:::['7-3-113']
if you don't know what you're doing at sea......you will die at sea.:::['7-3-114']
am i getting through to you, sailor?:::['7-3-115']
yes. don't just say yes.:::['7-3-116']
this isn't a game. you could get hurt out here!:::['7-3-117']
so do you want to pay attention, or do you want to die?:::['7-3-118']
i want to make a ship-to-shore call to chandler.:::['7-3-119']
all right, i definitely taste nutmeg. you do?:::['7-3-120']
you don't? heh. well, that's the difference......between a professional and a layman.:::['7-3-121']
that and arrogance.:::['7-3-122']
hey. how was sailing?:::['7-3-124']
i don't want to talk about it.:::['7-3-125', '5-2-31', '5-16-145']
you could've saved me a whole cookie. no!:::['7-3-126']
women are mean!:::['7-3-127']
i can't believe that.:::['7-3-128', '5-13-185']
now the only thing left of my grandmother's legacy is......this crumb.:::['7-3-129']
i wish you a long and happy marriage.:::['7-3-130']
hey. how was it?:::['7-3-131']
well, i had a great time.:::['7-3-132']
um, chauncey on the other hand...:::['7-3-133']
i will tell the story.:::['7-3-134']
it was going great. i let him win, we were bonding......he even said i could call him dad.:::['7-3-135']
and what did he ask you not to call him?:::['7-3-136']
"daddy.":::['7-3-137']
look, here's the story.:::['7-3-138']
chandler: we had just finished playing racquetball... ...and we were gonna take a steam.:::['7-3-139']
i walk into the steam room......and it's really steamy.:::['7-3-140']
so i take off my glasses, and that's when it happened.:::['7-3-141']
ross: over here. jack: have a seat, son.:::['7-3-143']
oh, my god, chandler! i can't believe it. i know.:::['7-3-145']
you gave my father a lap dance.:::['7-3-146']
why do they put so much steam in there?:::['7-3-147']
because otherwise they'd have to call it the "room" room.:::['7-3-148']
why, okay? why? why did that have to happen?:::['7-3-149']
come on, it's not that big a deal.:::['7-3-150']
not that big a deal? there...:::['7-3-151']
there was touching of things.:::['7-3-152']
i know you wanted to bond with my dad......but did you have to bond:::['7-3-153']
to that part?:::['7-3-154']
listen, i'm sure dad doesn't care. he probably thought this was funny.:::['7-3-155']
he'll be telling this story for years.:::['7-3-156']
i don't want him to tell this story for years.:::['7-3-157']
oh, but he will.:::['7-3-158']
he still tells the story about how monica tried to escape from fat camp.:::['7-3-159']
i wasn't escaping.:::['7-3-160']
then how'd you get caught in the barbed wire?:::['7-3-161']
i was trying to help out a squirrel.:::['7-3-162']
you were trying to eat it.:::['7-3-163']
if that is your father calling to tell this story......then the marriage is off!:::['7-3-164']
come on. hello.:::['7-3-165']
i'm sorry, you have the wrong number.:::['7-3-166']
okay, i'll call you later, dad. i love you.:::['7-3-167']
all right, i'm off to see your dad. oh, whoa.:::['7-3-168']
aren't you a little overdressed?:::['7-3-169']
yeah, and you better make sure he tips you this time.:::['7-3-170']
i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore......and i figured the best way:::['7-3-171']
to do that was face to face.:::['7-3-172']
and by "face," i don't mean his lap.:::['7-3-173']
and by "face," i don't mean my ass.:::['7-3-174']
are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present?:::['7-3-175']
i don't know. you know, they didn't get us anything.:::['7-3-176']
well, hello.:::['7-3-179', '7-17-12', '3-14-322']
so when are we getting back out on the water, matey?:::['7-3-180']
oh, uh, i don't know the boat way to say this, but, never.:::['7-3-181']
why not? because you're mean on the boat.:::['7-3-182']
wha...? i was just trying to teach you.:::['7-3-183']
well, lesson learned. rachel is mean.:::['7-3-184']
yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.:::['7-3-185']
i remember when she took me out on her dad's boat.:::['7-3-186']
she wouldn't let me help out at all.:::['7-3-187']
excuse me, i wanted you to help. but you couldn't move your arms......because you were wearing:::['7-3-188']
three life jackets.:::['7-3-189']
you have to respect the sea.:::['7-3-190']
look, joey, i'm sorry if you thought that was mean.:::['7-3-191']
but i tell you something, that was not mean.:::['7-3-192']
my father is mean. he used to yell at me all the time on the boat.:::['7-3-193']
it was horrible. i was being a really good teacher.:::['7-3-194']
does a good teacher say, "put down the beer, pinhead!":::['7-3-195']
does a good student drink 7 beers during his first lesson?:::['7-3-196']
six and a half.:::['7-3-197']
you knocked that last one out of my hand.:::['7-3-198']
i didn't want you to get hit by the boom.:::['7-3-199']
well, it hit me anyway.:::['7-3-200']
it would have hurt a lot less if i had finished that last beer.:::['7-3-201']
i'm sorry. i will try to tone it down and, uh, stop yelling.:::['7-3-202']
you won't boss me around? i won't boss you around.:::['7-3-203']
and you'll be nice? i'll be nice.:::['7-3-204']
and you'll be topless? and i... joey!:::['7-3-205']
you want me to learn?:::['7-3-206']
okay, here's batch 22. maybe these'll taste like your grandmother's.:::['7-3-207']
this has a bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.:::['7-3-208']
mm. let's give it a shot. monica: ugh.:::['7-3-209']
i have not made so many cookies since 9th grade.:::['7-3-210']
what was that for, a bake sale? no, just a friday night.:::['7-3-211']
mm. these are pretty good.:::['7-3-212']
yeah, but not as good as batch 17. mm-mm.:::['7-3-213']
which one was that?:::['7-3-214']
the ones we had after you almost threw up.:::['7-3-215']
oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.:::['7-3-216']
i did not like batch 16.:::['7-3-217']
are there any more from the good batch? we could work off those.:::['7-3-219']
well, yeah, i think there's one from batch 17 left. uh...:::['7-3-220']
batch 16. sixteen, people, get out of the way!:::['7-3-221']
okay, joey. honey, you're doing really good.:::['7-3-222']
i just need you to step to the portside.:::['7-3-223']
remember how we talked about the portside?:::['7-3-224']
oh, yeah. right?:::['7-3-225']
it's left, sweetie, but that's okay. that's a tough one.:::['7-3-227']
why not just say left?:::['7-3-228']
okay, go to the left.:::['7-3-229']
ahem, the left.:::['7-3-230']
huh? just sit over there!:::['7-3-231']
okay! okay! you're yelling again. see that?:::['7-3-232']
oh, no, no. very quiet. said with love, no yelling.:::['7-3-233']
you know what? since i'm here, i'm gonna have a beer on the portside.:::['7-3-234']
see what i did there? ha, ha.:::['7-3-235']
we're luffing a little. will you tighten up the cunningham?:::['7-3-236']
whoa, you just said a bunch of stuff i don't know.:::['7-3-237']
joey, come on! we just went over this.:::['7-3-238']
oh, when we did that was when that bird was overhead with the fish in his mouth.:::['7-3-239']
did you see it? it was gross. no! i did not see the bird.:::['7-3-240']
i did not see the fish! i did not see the piece of styrofoam shaped like mike tyson!:::['7-3-241']
i did not, because i was trying to teach you how to sail a boat.:::['7-3-242']
which obviously is an impossible thing to do.:::['7-3-243']
that's it! you're yelling, and i don't see you taking your top off.:::['7-3-244']
what do you mean? you can't quit. why not?:::['7-3-246']
because you're not finished! i won't have it. greens do not quit.:::['7-3-247']
greens?:::['7-3-248']
i'm a tribbiani. tribbianis quit.:::['7-3-249']
oh, my god. wait.:::['7-3-250']
did i...? i just said, "greens don't quit," didn't i?:::['7-3-251']
did i say, "greens don't quit"? yes! and you're still yelling at me.:::['7-3-252']
no, i'm not yelling at you. i'm just yelling near you.:::['7-3-253']
oh, god, joey. oh, i'm my father.:::['7-3-254']
oh, my god. this is horrible.:::['7-3-255']
i've been trying so hard not to be my mother, i did not see this coming.:::['7-3-256']
ugh, joey.:::['7-3-257']
i'm sorry, i'm so sorry. i just wanted you to learn.:::['7-3-258']
ugh. hey, i...:::['7-3-259']
i did learn.:::['7-3-260']
really? yeah, come on.:::['7-3-261']
no. yeah. it's okay.:::['7-3-262']
i know what a mainsail is. huh?:::['7-3-263']
i know to duck when the boom comes across.:::['7-3-264']
i know port is right. left.:::['7-3-265']
you know, i bet it would make my grandma happy......to know that we're trying:::['7-3-267']
to figure out her recipe.:::['7-3-268']
i bet she's looking up at us and smiling right now.:::['7-3-269']
looking up?:::['7-3-270']
oh, yeah, no, she was really nice to me but she's in hell for sure.:::['7-3-271']
well, i've tried everything. i give up.:::['7-3-272']
i'm not gonna be the mom who makes the world's best cookies.:::['7-3-273']
i do make the best duck confit with broccoli raab.:::['7-3-274']
kids love that, right?:::['7-3-275']
aw, pheeb, isn't there any relative that would have the recipe?:::['7-3-276']
what about your sister?:::['7-3-277']
oh, no. i made a promise to myself that the next time......i would talk to ursula:::['7-3-278']
is over my dead body.:::['7-3-279']
and that's not happening until october 15, 2032.:::['7-3-280']
that's the day you're gonna die? see.:::['7-3-281']
darn it, i've got shuffleboard that day. heh.:::['7-3-282']
that's what you think.:::['7-3-283']
what about friends of your grandmother? would they have the recipe?:::['7-3-284']
you know, i may have relatives in france who would know.:::['7-3-285']
my grandmother said she got the recipe... ...from her grandmother, "nestley toulouse.":::['7-3-286']
what was her name?:::['7-3-287']
nestley toulouse.:::['7-3-288']
nestlé toll house?:::['7-3-289']
you americans always butcher the french language.:::['7-3-291']
phoebe, is this the recipe?:::['7-3-292']
i cannot believe that i spent the last two days trying to figure out that recipe.:::['7-3-295']
it was in my cupboard the whole time!:::['7-3-296']
i know! you see, it is stuff like this......which is why you're burning in hell!:::['7-3-297']
chandler: so you understand.:::['7-3-298']
i'd feel more comfortable if you didn't tell people.:::['7-3-299']
you know, i'm a little embarrassed about it.:::['7-3-300']
i understand completely. there's nothing more horrifying......than embarrassing yourself:::['7-3-301']
in front of your in-laws.:::['7-3-302']
as a matter of fact, when i started dating judy, i was unemployed.:::['7-3-303']
her father asked me what i did for a living.:::['7-3-304']
i told him i was a lawyer. heh.:::['7-3-305']
what'd you do when they found out? they never did.:::['7-3-306']
so if you ever see me giving them legal advice, just nod along.:::['7-3-307']
shall we?:::['7-3-308']
so, i guess we wear swimsuits in here.:::['7-3-309']
well, joey, i hate to admit it......your way of sailing:::['7-3-310']
is a lot more fun.:::['7-3-311']
yep, yep.:::['7-3-312']
hey, why don't you give a pull on that rope?:::['7-3-313']
we're not sailing.:::['7-3-314']
just pull on it. all right.:::['7-3-315']
hey! eh?:::['7-3-316']
sandwiches!:::['7-3-317']
what else? ha, ha.:::['7-3-318']
thank you. oh, wow.:::['7-3-320']
what are you doing? oops. sorry.:::['7-3-321']
don't hold it like that. you're letting all the good stuff fall out.:::['7-3-322']
oh. oops. careful! you're wasting good pastrami!:::['7-3-323']
oh, my god. i'm my dad!:::['7-3-324']
hey. who wants french toast? oh, i'll have some.:::['7-2-0']
me too. eggs and milk in the fridge. thanks.:::['7-2-1']
oh, what's the matter, honey? my hand feels weird.:::['7-2-3']
i guess it's because i'm engaged.:::['7-2-4']
when will that start getting annoying? start?:::['7-2-5']
so let's actually get started on the wedding plans.:::['7-2-6']
okay. already?:::['7-2-7']
yeah, we got a lot to do. we gotta think about the flowers... ...the caterers, the music...:::['7-2-8']
oh, i got some thoughts on the music... chandler, too many cooks...:::['7-2-9']
take it from me. all you have to do is show up and try to say the right name.:::['7-2-10']
what in god's name is that? oh, my god, the wedding book?:::['7-2-12']
i haven't seen that since the 4th grade.:::['7-2-13']
this baby has everything. take, you know, locations for instance::::['7-2-14']
first organized alphabetically, then geographically......then by square footage.:::['7-2-15']
that is so smart. ha.:::['7-2-16']
break it off. ahem. break it off, now.:::['7-2-17']
and that should conclusively prove......that i had the idea:::['7-2-18']
for jurassic park first.:::['7-2-19']
now, let's take a look... hey, ross.:::['7-2-20']
phoebe, oh, my god, what are you doing here?:::['7-2-21']
i need to talk to you. it's pretty urgent. it's about monica and chandler.:::['7-2-22']
oh, my god. um, of course.:::['7-2-23']
uh, would you please excuse me for a moment?:::['7-2-24']
um, heh, do you know each other's hometowns? why don't you?:::['7-2-25']
well, um, not much. i was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged......that maybe it'd be nice:::['7-2-27']
if they had some privacy.:::['7-2-28']
so could i just move in with you for a couple days?:::['7-2-29']
okay, yeah, sure. but what's wrong with monica and chandler?:::['7-2-31']
nothing. why?:::['7-2-32']
phoebe, you said it was urgent.:::['7-2-33']
oh, yeah, it is. i'm going to the movies and it starts in like five minutes.:::['7-2-34']
do you realize i have a classroom full of students?:::['7-2-35']
oh, i'm sorry. i'm so rude. does anyone want to come to the movies?:::['7-2-36']
i haven't cleared the budget with my parents yet......but tell me how this is for music.:::['7-2-37']
all right, um, a string quartet for the processional, a jazz trio for cocktails......the bay city rollers:::['7-2-38']
for dancing...:::['7-2-39']
wait, that was for my 6th grade wedding.:::['7-2-40']
well, you couldn't get them anyway. ian doesn't play anymore, and derek...:::['7-2-41']
well, derek is a name i shouldn't know.:::['7-2-42']
hey, mon, do you have another pillow, you know, something a little snugglier?:::['7-2-43']
why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?:::['7-2-44']
the duck. what, the duck?:::['7-2-45']
what the hell did the damn duck do now?:::['7-2-46']
uh, well, he did not get sick somewhere in there......and it was immediately found:::['7-2-47']
and properly cleaned up.:::['7-2-48']
now, do i get to look at this book......or is it just for people who are actually:::['7-2-49']
involved in the wedding?:::['7-2-50']
of course you can look at it. yeah, i want your opinion too.:::['7-2-51']
okay. here you go.:::['7-2-52']
what do you think about centerpieces? centerpieces.:::['7-2-53']
roses or lilies? definitely roses.:::['7-2-54']
well, i just think they're a bit more wedding-y, you know.:::['7-2-55']
but lilies are the clear choice. oh, my god, it's like one mind.:::['7-2-56']
guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.:::['7-2-58']
i'm gonna get cranky.:::['7-2-59']
joey, there is a perfectly good couch across the hall.:::['7-2-60']
yes, it is perfectly good......and it is not one of the places:::['7-2-61']
the duck got sick.:::['7-2-62']
all right, i'm gonna go. joey, what did the duck do?:::['7-2-64']
i don't know, but he did not eat your face cream.:::['7-2-65']
hey, little buddy.:::['7-2-66']
how you feeling? aah.:::['7-2-67']
what the hell is in that face cream?:::['7-2-68']
that's so soft.:::['7-2-69']
pillowcases.:::['7-2-70']
joey: "zelda looked at the chimney sweep. her father, the vicar...":::['7-2-72']
vicar?:::['7-2-73']
"...wouldn't be home for hours.:::['7-2-74']
her loins were burning.:::['7-2-75']
she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his...":::['7-2-76']
this is a dirty book.:::['7-2-78']
uh, phoebe?:::['7-2-80']
oh, ross, hi.:::['7-2-81']
phoebe, what are you doing? i'm sorry, i'm with a client right now.:::['7-2-82']
phoebe. okay, let's talk outside.:::['7-2-83']
phoebe, you can't massage people in my apartment.:::['7-2-84']
what's the big deal? i did it at monica and chandler's.:::['7-2-85']
and they knew about it?:::['7-2-86']
okay, look, ross, what is this really about?:::['7-2-87']
look, this is my home, and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want.:::['7-2-88']
okay. i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments.:::['7-2-89']
i just don't know what the big deal is.:::['7-2-90']
the big deal is i don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment......when i want to kick back with a puzzle...:::['7-2-91']
beer, cold beer.:::['7-2-92']
hey, joey. what are you doing?:::['7-2-93']
sweeping. why? does it turn you on?:::['7-2-94']
what if i was, uh, sweeping a chimney?:::['7-2-97']
joey, did you eat my face cream?:::['7-2-98']
where are you going? the vicar won't be home for hours.:::['7-2-99']
joey... ...where did you learn that word?:::['7-2-100']
where do you think......zelda?:::['7-2-101']
you found my book? yeah, i did.:::['7-2-102']
joey, what are you doing going into my bedroom?:::['7-2-103']
okay, i'm sorry. i went in there to take a nap. and i know i shouldn't have, but you got porn.:::['7-2-104']
rachel: ugh.:::['7-2-105']
you know what? i don't care. i'm not ashamed of my book.:::['7-2-106']
there's nothing wrong with a woman enjoying a little erotica.:::['7-2-107']
it's just a healthy expression of female sexuality......which, by the way, is something:::['7-2-108']
that you will never understand.:::['7-2-109']
you got porn.:::['7-2-110']
hello. hi, is, uh, phoebe here?:::['7-2-111']
uh, no, no, she's out for the night. oh, great.:::['7-2-112']
heh. can i help you with something?:::['7-2-113']
i don't know. are you a masseur?:::['7-2-114']
great. dad?:::['7-2-116']
thank you so much. i'll be back to pick him up in an hour.:::['7-2-117']
so, chandler, your parents must've been thrilled... ...when you told them you were engaged.:::['7-2-118']
oh, yeah. i should probably call them.:::['7-2-119']
i remember when we first got engaged.:::['7-2-120']
i don't think i've heard that story. dad, you don't...:::['7-2-121']
well, i'd gotten judy pregnant.:::['7-2-122']
i still don't know how.:::['7-2-123']
you don't know how? your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.:::['7-2-124']
what a sweet story.:::['7-2-125']
at least you're not hearing it at your 5th grade halloween party.:::['7-2-126']
what? they wanted a scary story.:::['7-2-127']
anyway, we're really excited about our wedding plans.:::['7-2-128']
pretty soon we'll be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund.:::['7-2-129']
what? you tell her, jack. i can't do it.:::['7-2-130']
what happened? you still have the wedding fund, don't you?:::['7-2-131']
we have it. only now we call it "the beach house.":::['7-2-132']
i can't believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house.:::['7-2-133']
we're sorry. we assumed......if you got married after you turned 30:::['7-2-134']
you'd pay for it yourself.:::['7-2-135']
you bought the beach house when i was 23.:::['7-2-136']
which means you had seven years of beach fun......and you can't put a price on that,sweetie.:::['7-2-137']
we really do feel bad about this though.:::['7-2-138']
we started saving again when you dated richard.:::['7-2-139']
but then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.:::['7-2-140']
what about when i started dating chandler?:::['7-2-141']
it was chandler. we didn't think he'd ever propose.:::['7-2-142']
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. heh.:::['7-2-143']
i can't believe there is no money for my wedding.:::['7-2-144']
we might still have some if your father hadn't thought......to sell ice over the internet.:::['7-2-145']
it seemed like such a simple idea. stupid, jack. the word is stupid.:::['7-2-146']
all right, enough. i don't want to hear about it anymore.:::['7-2-147']
good luck, chandler.:::['7-2-148', '5-16-309']
okay, now i'm going to......touch you.:::['7-2-149']
oh, that's soft.:::['7-2-150']
i can't believe this. do you think your parents could help pay for it?:::['7-2-151']
my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding.:::['7-2-153']
she's saving the rest for her divorce.:::['7-2-154']
and any extra cash my father has, he saves for his yearly trips to......dollywood.:::['7-2-155']
what happened at dinner? my parents spent the money for our wedding.:::['7-2-156']
my god, what did you order?:::['7-2-157']
wait, there's no money? well, this is terrible.:::['7-2-158']
you guys are gonna have to get married in, like, a rec center.:::['7-2-159']
honey, it's gonna be okay. no, it's not gonna be okay. it sucks.:::['7-2-160']
no swing band, no lilies. no, you know what? it's gonna be okay.:::['7-2-161']
i mean, you don't need to have this......rustic italian feast, you know?:::['7-2-162']
and you don't need this custom-made empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.:::['7-2-163']
you can wear off-the-rack.:::['7-2-164']
look, it really is gonna be okay.:::['7-2-165']
the important thing is that we love each other and we're gonna get married.:::['7-2-166']
do you even understand what "off-the-rack" means?:::['7-2-167']
why don't you just pay for it yourself?:::['7-2-168']
how? i don't have any money.:::['7-2-169']
well, i have some. how much?:::['7-2-170']
well, close to...:::['7-2-171']
whoa! are you kidding me? what? how much?:::['7-2-172']
it's enough for wedding scenario a. really?:::['7-2-173']
how great are you, you little saver? heh.:::['7-2-174']
the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.:::['7-2-175']
oh, you guys are so made for each other.:::['7-2-176']
well, you're not suggesting we spend all of the money on the wedding?:::['7-2-177']
look, mon, i've been saving this money for six years......and i kind of have some of it earmarked:::['7-2-179']
for the future, not just for a party.:::['7-2-180']
wow. hello, mr. chandler.:::['7-2-181']
sweetie, this is the most special day of our lives.:::['7-2-182']
i realize that, honey, but i'm not gonna spend all the money on one party.:::['7-2-183']
honey, um, i love you. heh.:::['7-2-184']
but, um, if you call our wedding a party one more time......you may not get invited.:::['7-2-185']
we can always earn more money, okay? but we're only gonna get married once.:::['7-2-186']
look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down, okay? the answer is no.:::['7-2-187']
you're gonna have to put your foot down?:::['7-2-188']
wow. money and a firm hand.:::['7-2-190']
finally a chandler i can get onboard with.:::['7-2-191']
hey, rach. joey.:::['7-2-192']
hey, rach, do you smell smoke?:::['7-2-193']
uh-huh. i get it. smoke, chimney, chimney sweep. very funny. ha, ha.:::['7-2-194']
no, no, no, i'm serious. you don't smell it?:::['7-2-195']
something's on fire.:::['7-2-196']
no, i don't smell anything.:::['7-2-197']
oh, you know what? it's probably just your burning loins.:::['7-2-198']
hey, what are you guys talking about? nothing.:::['7-2-199']
mm, damn, this coffee's cold.:::['7-2-200']
hey, rach, do you mind if i heat this up on your loins?:::['7-2-201']
you know, i cannot believe you told him. joey...:::['7-2-202']
so i guess you bought that book after we broke up, huh?:::['7-2-203']
uh-huh, i did, because i wore out my first copy when i was with you.:::['7-2-204']
oh, yeah? yeah?:::['7-2-205']
well, uh, when we were going out, i read tons of porno magazines.:::['7-2-206']
'sup?:::['7-2-207']
ross, how could you do that to an old man?:::['7-2-208']
excuse me, ladies.:::['7-2-209']
my massage client, arthur.:::['7-2-211']
his daughter called and said some guy that worked for me......gave him a really weird massage:::['7-2-212']
this afternoon.:::['7-2-213']
i gave him an extremely professional massage.:::['7-2-214']
he said you poked at him with wooden spoons.:::['7-2-215']
okay, so it wasn't a traditional massage.:::['7-2-216']
but i did give him acupressure with a pair of chopsticks......and i gently exfoliated him:::['7-2-217']
with a mop.:::['7-2-218']
well, he's never coming back, okay? you just cost me $80 a week.:::['7-2-219']
you know what? this is your fault. you didn't move his appointment.:::['7-2-220']
oh, it's my fault? you didn't have to massage him.:::['7-2-221']
you could've sent him away.:::['7-2-222']
you could've not rolled tonka trucks up and down his back.:::['7-2-223']
he said he liked that.:::['7-2-224']
you're right, you're right. i'm sorry.:::['7-2-225']
dude, what are you massaging an old man for?:::['7-2-226']
his daughter was hot. gotcha.:::['7-2-227']
and it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all your money on our wedding.:::['7-2-230']
i mean, you work really hard for that.:::['7-2-231']
well. well, you work for that.:::['7-2-232']
look, i thought about it too.:::['7-2-233']
and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.:::['7-2-234']
you do? yeah, i'm putting my foot down.:::['7-2-235']
yeah, look, when i proposed, i told you......that i would do anything:::['7-2-236']
and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy......then that's what we're gonna do.:::['7-2-238']
oh, but wait.:::['7-2-240']
what about our...? what about the future and stuff?:::['7-2-241']
ah, forget about the future and stuff.:::['7-2-242']
so we only have two kids.:::['7-2-243']
you know, we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.:::['7-2-244']
have you thought about that? yeah.:::['7-2-245']
how many kids were we gonna have?:::['7-2-246']
uh, four. a boy, twin girls and another boy.:::['7-2-247']
what else did you think about?:::['7-2-248']
well, heh, stuff like where we'd live, you know.:::['7-2-249']
like a small place outside the city......where our kids could learn:::['7-2-250']
to ride their bikes and stuff.:::['7-2-251']
we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar......and we could hear it every time:::['7-2-252']
i don't want a big, fancy wedding.:::['7-2-256']
i want everything that you've just said. i want a marriage.:::['7-2-258']
hey, listen, when you were talking about our future, you said cat.:::['7-2-261']
but you meant dog, right? ha, ha.:::['7-2-262']
ha, yeah, totally. oh, good.:::['7-2-263']
hello, zelda.:::['7-2-264']
who are you supposed to be? the vicar.:::['7-2-265']
do you even know what a vicar is? like a goalie, right?:::['7-2-266']
look, joey, it's enough, all right?:::['7-2-268']
you keep making these stupid jokes and these sleazy innuendoes......and it's just not funny anymore.:::['7-2-269']
all right, i'm sorry. rach, i'm sorry. okay? i'm sorry.:::['7-2-270']
maybe i could make it up to you by taking you roughly in the barn.:::['7-2-271']
all right, you know what? that's it. you want to do it? let's do it.:::['7-2-273']
that's right. i want to do it with you.:::['7-2-275']
been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.:::['7-2-276']
uh, i did?:::['7-2-277']
yeah, oh, i've been waiting so long to get on that body.:::['7-2-278']
this body? yeah, that's right.:::['7-2-279']
come on, joey, sex me up.:::['7-2-280']
hey, you're starting to sound like the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.:::['7-2-281']
oh, come on, now. don't keep me waiting. get those clothes off.:::['7-2-282']
but i would keep that helmet on, because you're in for a rough ride.:::['7-2-283']
i don't want to. i'm scared.:::['7-2-284']
so thanks for coming by, guys.:::['7-15-0']
we wanted to bounce some ideas off of you about the wedding ceremony.:::['7-15-1']
what's the matter? are you okay? yeah, it's just...:::['7-15-3']
monica said "wedding.":::['7-15-4']
uh, so we wanted to know if one of you would like to read something.:::['7-15-5']
okay, yeah, i guess i can do that too.:::['7-15-6']
too?:::['7-15-7']
yeah, i kind of, ahem, have something else planned for you guys.:::['7-15-8']
do you mind telling us what it is? sorry.:::['7-15-9']
i'm kind of keeping this one on the qt.:::['7-15-10']
well, whatever it is, i hope it involves winking.:::['7-15-11']
so i talked to one of the dool writers...:::['7-15-13']
what is dool? days of our lives.:::['7-15-14']
you're not gonna believe it. my character is coming out of his coma!:::['7-15-15']
that's wonderful. wow, joey.:::['7-15-16']
and not only that. i'm getting a new brain!:::['7-15-17']
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life.:::['7-15-18']
what do you mean you're getting a new brain?:::['7-15-19']
they're killing off one of the characters, and when she dies......and her brain is being transplanted:::['7-15-20']
into my body.:::['7-15-21']
heh, what? a brain transplant?:::['7-15-22']
it's ridiculous.:::['7-15-23']
i think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.:::['7-15-24']
it's winter. there are fewer people on the street.:::['7-15-25']
who are they killing off?:::['7-15-26']
uh, cecilia monroe. she plays jessica lockhart.:::['7-15-27']
she is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.:::['7-15-29']
i don't think i've ever seen her finish a beverage.:::['7-15-30']
the way she slaps people. wouldn't you love to do that?:::['7-15-31']
don't do it.:::['7-15-32']
and she's been on the show forever.:::['7-15-33']
it's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes. yeah.:::['7-15-34']
help me out here. when you...:::['7-15-35']
when you come out of the "brain transplant"......you are going to be her?:::['7-15-36']
yes, but in drake ramoray's body.:::['7-15-37']
why is this so hard for you to get? i thought you were a scientist.:::['7-15-38']
rach, so that guy there::::['7-15-39']
straight or gay?:::['7-15-40']
rachel: oh. oh, yeah, he's too cute to be straight. ha, ha.:::['7-15-41']
ooh, knockers will help us figure it out.:::['7-15-42']
all right, straight.:::['7-15-43']
and not subtle.:::['7-15-44']
he left his cell phone. oh?:::['7-15-45']
we could hand it to gunther, he'll put it in lost and found.:::['7-15-46']
or we could use it to call china, see how those guys are doing.:::['7-15-47']
what if, uh, he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it, and i answer......and we start talking:::['7-15-48']
and we fell in love?:::['7-15-49']
wouldn't that be a great story?:::['7-15-50']
kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age. yeah.:::['7-15-51']
that does sound great. i'm gonna get the phone.:::['7-15-52']
what? wait. why do you get the story?:::['7-15-53']
i don't know. i haven't been out on a date in so long.:::['7-15-54']
phoebe, you had a date three days ago.:::['7-15-55']
that wasn't a date. that was friends getting together and having sex.:::['7-15-56']
okay. great. see, i get the phone.:::['7-15-57']
no way. you just broke up with tag a week ago.:::['7-15-58']
yeah, and until now, i didn't think i would love again.:::['7-15-59']
nice try. hey, wait.:::['7-15-60']
how do we fairly decide who gets the phone?:::['7-15-61']
well, um...:::['7-15-63', '2-13-248', '4-2-34', '3-20-195', '3-15-245']
maybe we could, uh...:::['7-15-64']
ah-ha! too slow! ha-ha-ha.:::['7-15-65']
ah-ha! too cocky.:::['7-15-66']
i'm going to date him. there's nothing you can do.:::['7-15-67']
yes, there is.:::['7-15-68']
what, are you going to kill him like you did charles?:::['7-15-69']
oh, my baby.:::['7-15-70']
that was a great scene. and that slap looked so real. how do you do that?:::['7-15-72']
oh, just years of experience. can i get some ice here?:::['7-15-73']
anyway, i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are.:::['7-15-74']
you're not the fan who's dying, are you?:::['7-15-75']
no, uh, i'm joey tribbiani. we did a scene together yesterday.:::['7-15-76']
i'm the guy in the coma. oh, that was a real person?:::['7-15-77']
i wanted to say, since i'm getting your brain when you leave the show......i was wondering if there was any tips...:::['7-15-78']
i'm leaving the show?:::['7-15-79']
i don't know, why? did you hear something?:::['7-15-80']
who told you that? oh, uh...:::['7-15-81']
one of the writers. which? was it bald or was it tall?:::['7-15-82']
you know, it doesn't matter, because it is not true.:::['7-15-83']
okay. whoo, eh.:::['7-15-84']
and if it were true, how dare you come to me and ask me for tips......about a character i've been playing:::['7-15-85']
for 20 years!:::['7-15-86']
miss monroe... oh, there you go.:::['7-15-87']
okay, look, i have an idea.:::['7-15-88']
why don't we see what kind of numbers he has on his speed dial?:::['7-15-89']
and then from that, we can tell who has more in common with him... ...and whoever does gets the phone.:::['7-15-90']
fine. all right. all right.:::['7-15-91']
first name on the speed dial is "mom." oh.:::['7-15-92']
i lost my mom to suicide.:::['7-15-93']
okay, no way.:::['7-15-94']
you can't use that to get the cute guy and the last muffin. did i use that already today? i'm sorry.:::['7-15-95']
"ben, carlos, david...":::['7-15-96']
oh, i win. he's got barney's on his speed dial.:::['7-15-97']
so? you don't know that it's barney's the store.:::['7-15-98']
that could be his friend's house, or a bar, or...:::['7-15-99']
who has barney's the store on their speed dial?:::['7-15-100']
his new girlfriend.:::['7-15-101']
i think it's the dying cat parade.:::['7-15-103']
sounds like it's coming from across the street.:::['7-15-104']
the thing that ross was gonna do at our wedding?:::['7-15-106']
he was hanging out with me yesterday and he said, "you're half scottish, right?":::['7-15-107']
no. there is no way. it cannot be ross.:::['7-15-108']
unbelievable. why is your family scottish?:::['7-15-109']
why is your family ross?:::['7-15-110']
he cannot play at our wedding. everyone will leave.:::['7-15-111']
i mean, come on. that is just noise!:::['7-15-112']
it's not even a song.:::['7-15-113']
wait. if you listen very carefully, i think......it's "celebration" by kool and the gang.:::['7-15-114']
you're absolutely right. they are writing me out of the show.:::['7-15-115']
they don't know exactly when it's going to happen, but apparently it's soon......and then that's it.:::['7-15-116']
i'm sorry. if it was up to me, you would never leave the show.:::['7-15-117']
yeah, thanks. no, i mean it.:::['7-15-118']
i can't believe they'd do this to you. and to your fans.:::['7-15-119']
they're gonna be devastated. heartbroken. they love you so much.:::['7-15-120']
oh, you're right.:::['7-15-121']
what's your name again? uh...:::['7-15-123']
joey. joey. well, thank you.:::['7-15-124']
that is so sweet. oh.:::['7-15-125']
the... the only reason i came up to you before... ...was because, well......because i'm really nervous:::['7-15-126']
about being you.:::['7-15-127']
you know, if you could help me capture the essence of the character.:::['7-15-128']
help me keep jessica alive. please?:::['7-15-129']
all right, joey, i will help you.:::['7-15-130']
not because i owe it to this stupid show......but because i owe it to jessica.:::['7-15-131']
oh, that's great. thank you so much. you're so welcome.:::['7-15-132']
i've been watching some tapes. how's this?:::['7-15-133']
will never step foot in this place again!:::['7-15-134']
ever!:::['7-15-135', '3-24-301']
oh, but, jessica doesn't have an english accent.:::['7-15-136']
i can do an english accent?:::['7-15-137']
that baby's going on my resume.:::['7-15-138']
hi, pheebs. how are you? good.:::['7-15-139']
um, phoebe, remember when we were in the coffeehouse......we decided i was gonna keep:::['7-15-140']
the cute guy's phone?:::['7-15-141']
yeah. and i was gonna keep it in my purse... ...so if it rang, i could just pick it up? yeah.:::['7-15-142']
and then do you remember going into my purse and stealing the phone?:::['7-15-143']
ooh, now you lost me.:::['7-15-144']
you stole the phone. no, i didn't.:::['7-15-145']
no? so you're saying that if i called it, it wouldn't ring?:::['7-15-146']
no. hmm. okay.:::['7-15-147']
but while you dial, let me show you the features of my new ringing handbag.:::['7-15-148']
oh, it does work.:::['7-15-150']
phoebe. that is a different phone.:::['7-15-151']
oh, is it? hello. yes, hi. is rachel there?:::['7-15-152']
yes, she is. just one moment, please. it's for me!:::['7-15-153']
that is damning evidence. ugh.:::['7-15-154']
oh, my god. i bet that's him.:::['7-15-155']
my digital fairy tale's about to begin.:::['7-15-156']
it's ri...:::['7-15-157']
would you stop doing that?:::['7-15-158']
hello? yes, i'm the one who found your phone.:::['7-15-159']
phoebe, you can't do th... shh, i'm on a call.:::['7-15-160']
well, yeah, i mean, you could pick it up tonight. say, 8:30?:::['7-15-161']
at my apartment. it's, um...:::['7-15-162']
it's, um, 5 morton street, apartment 14.:::['7-15-163']
and then maybe, you know, after, we could grab a bite to eat or whatever.:::['7-15-164']
okay. okay, i'll see you then. bye.:::['7-15-165']
you do know that i will be here when he comes over.:::['7-15-166']
oh, and how will you know what time to come over?:::['7-15-167']
you just said it.:::['7-15-168']
joey, the essence of the character is rooted in her confidence.:::['7-15-170']
so when jessica enters a room, for instance......she owns everything......and every person in that room.:::['7-15-171']
you try it. okay.:::['7-15-172']
right. well, he's not mad at the room.:::['7-15-173']
try it again. he owns it. he owns the room.:::['7-15-174']
it is his. he owns, owns, owns the room! he owns it!:::['7-15-175']
it's a little weird, but it's getting better.:::['7-15-176']
oh, i'm gonna miss this woman so much. i don't know what i'm gonna do.:::['7-15-177']
it's been 20 years of my life.:::['7-15-178']
hey, hey. maybe... maybe, uh... maybe this is a good thing.:::['7-15-179']
you know? lt'll give you a chance to shake things up. play different characters.:::['7-15-180']
you're so talented.:::['7-15-181']
probably should've just left years ago when the offers were pouring in......but, you know,i just got so comfy here and...:::['7-15-182']
ugh, i turned down some amazing work.:::['7-15-183']
like what? well......let's just say if i'd left 15 years ago......the landscape of mexican:::['7-15-184']
cinema would be very different today.:::['7-15-185']
but, well, now... now's a different time for me.:::['7-15-187']
oh, hey, come on. don't, uh... don't do this.:::['7-15-188']
let me tell you something, okay?:::['7-15-189']
when i watch you do a scene, i'm thinking, "boy, she is a great actress.":::['7-15-190']
but... but i'm also thinking, "she is hot.":::['7-15-191']
you think i'm hot?:::['7-15-192']
you own the room.:::['7-15-193']
we... we should probably get the...:::['7-15-194']
oh, yeah. yeah, we should get...:::['7-15-195']
so when jessica kisses a man......she usually puts, um......both her hands on the man's face.:::['7-15-196']
yeah, i notice that. is that because she's so passionate?:::['7-15-197']
no, it's because that way the camera only sees her.:::['7-15-198']
you want to try it?:::['7-15-199']
that was good. that was really good.:::['7-15-201']
but i think that maybe your hands are just a little off. they should be, maybe... like, right... mm.:::['7-15-202']
well, i feel like a snack.:::['7-15-203']
do you want some shortbread? it's scottish, like you are.:::['7-15-204']
oh, no, thanks. i don't like anything from my scottish heritage.:::['7-15-205']
well, it's just that my entire family was run out of scotland by......vikings.:::['7-15-207']
it sounds to me like your family's ready to, uh, rediscover its scottish roots.:::['7-15-208']
you can't play bagpipes at the wedding!:::['7-15-209']
how did you know about that?:::['7-15-210']
we heard you play all the way from your apartment. were you the ones who called the cops?:::['7-15-211']
that's not really important right now. ahem.:::['7-15-212']
what is important is, while we appreciate the gesture......we just don't feel that bagpipes:::['7-15-213']
are appropriate for our wedding.:::['7-15-214']
why not? because we hate them.:::['7-15-215']
just give me a chance to perform for you, and then decide whatever you want.:::['7-15-216']
i'm not gonna tell you what song i'm gonna play, either. but, uh......let's just say when it's over......i'll bet there'll be:::['7-15-217']
a wee bit o' celebration.:::['7-15-218']
hey, hey!:::['7-15-219']
tom: hi, it's tom. i'm here to pick up the phone. ah!:::['7-15-221']
whoa, why do you get to answer the door?:::['7-15-222']
why shouldn't i? because it's my apartment.:::['7-15-223']
well, then i get to give him the phone.:::['7-15-224']
okay. good luck explaining all the calls to china.:::['7-15-225']
wow, how long were we arguing for?:::['7-15-227']
um, ha, ha.:::['7-15-228']
you're not the man who left the cell phone.:::['7-15-229']
no, that's my assistant. is he coming?:::['7-15-230']
um, no.:::['7-15-231', '5-13-88']
could you, uh, give us one second?:::['7-15-232']
sure. we'll be right back, sir.:::['7-15-233']
well, what do we do? i don't know.:::['7-15-234']
we were waiting for a hot guy and an even hotter one shows up.:::['7-15-236']
i know...:::['7-15-237']
rachel, listen......if you let me have him,then i will really owe you one.:::['7-15-239']
all right, phoebe, i will let you have him.:::['7-15-241']
but you owe me. you owe me big.:::['7-15-242']
so which one of you lovely ladies am i gonna take to dinner, huh?:::['7-15-243']
oh, that'd be me, sir.:::['7-15-244']
after you. okay, thank you.:::['7-15-245']
well, you certainly own that room.:::['7-15-247']
actually, i rent the whole place. and i just got what you meant. thank you.:::['7-15-248']
hi. joey: hey.:::['7-15-249', '3-13-46']
aah! jessica lockhart! in my apartment!:::['7-15-251']
i am such a huge fan. i am such a huge fan.:::['7-15-252']
well, it's nice to know that...:::['7-15-253']
monica! monica!:::['7-15-254']
that, uh... that's my roommate, rachel.:::['7-15-255']
oh, that explains all the women's underwear.:::['7-15-256']
oh, my god, it's true!:::['7-15-258']
can i just ask you to do me... aw... . just one favor?:::['7-15-260']
certainly.:::['7-15-261']
would you slap me? would you slap me right here in the face?:::['7-15-262']
i'd love to, but my lawyer said i can't do that anymore.:::['7-15-263']
all right, here we go. okay.:::['7-15-264']
no, wait. just one moment. um...:::['7-15-265']
you're a stupid bitch. i really can't slap you.:::['7-15-266']
my god, you're great. thanks for stopping by. see you.:::['7-15-267']
i am so sorry about that. oh, no, no, no.:::['7-15-268']
being adored, i'm used to it. don't worry about it.:::['7-15-269']
they sent me today's script. they never send me the script.:::['7-15-271']
they don't? well, no, i'm in a coma.:::['7-15-272']
this must mean i have lines.:::['7-15-273']
how does it happen?:::['7-15-275']
you get thrown from a horse into an electric fence.:::['7-15-277']
a what? jessica hates horses.:::['7-15-278']
i'm guessing after this she's not gonna be crazy about electricity, either.:::['7-15-279']
loosening the saddle on mother's horse was brilliant, fredrick.:::['7-15-280']
and the electric fence, inspired.:::['7-15-281']
thank you, sweetheart.:::['7-15-282']
i can't believe she's really gone.:::['7-15-283']
look around you. all of this is ours.:::['7-15-284']
what's the matter, dina?:::['7-15-287']
don't you recognize your own......mother?:::['7-15-288']
director: cut! that was great, everybody. thank you.:::['7-15-289']
that was so wonderful!:::['7-15-290']
oh, i think that you're a better jessica than i ever was.:::['7-15-291']
oh, no. of course not, but you were very good.:::['7-15-292']
heh, thanks.:::['7-15-293']
guess what? good news. i got another job.:::['7-15-294']
great. hey, all right! what is it?:::['7-15-295']
a film in guadalajara.:::['7-15-296']
the airport?:::['7-15-297']
no, that's laguardia.:::['7-15-298']
this is mexico. oh, wow.:::['7-15-299']
well, how long will you be gone?:::['7-15-300']
eight months.:::['7-15-301']
that's a really long time. yeah, but you could come and visit me.:::['7-15-302']
i bet that you could, uh, own a few places down there.:::['7-15-303']
oh, you know, i should probably buy a place in the city first.:::['7-15-304']
and i just got what you meant. that is a...:::['7-15-305']
i'll tell you, that's a tricky one. it's a tricky one.:::['7-15-306']
good luck.:::['7-15-308', '10-1-209', '5-23-247', '4-12-148']
you too.:::['7-15-309', '2-15-202', '3-20-317']
ahem. okay, now, uh, remember, i'm still learning.:::['7-15-310']
then squeaking]:::['7-15-311']
one, two, three, four!:::['7-15-312']
"celebration"]:::['7-15-313']
you know the song. sing along.:::['7-15-314']
ross: happy birthday!:::['7-14-0']
happy birthday!:::['7-14-1', '2-16-74']
rach, come on. all: come on.:::['7-14-2']
it's your birthday.:::['7-14-3']
she's not as pretty as she was when she was 29.:::['7-14-5']
ms. green wants to establish some ground rules before she comes out.:::['7-14-6']
she would appreciate it if you didn't use the words "old" or "downhill"......or "they still look pretty damn good.":::['7-14-7']
they do.:::['7-14-8']
rachel, come on out.:::['7-14-9']
monica made breakfast.:::['7-14-10']
chocolate chip pancakes.:::['7-14-11']
we've got presents.:::['7-14-12']
good ones?:::['7-14-13']
they all came from the list you handed out to us two weeks ago.:::['7-14-14']
well, can i keep the presents and still be 29?:::['7-14-15']
come on, rach, look, turning 30 is not that big a deal.:::['7-14-16']
oh, really? is that how you felt when you turned 30?:::['7-14-17']
why, god, why?:::['7-14-18']
we had a deal. let the others grow old, not me.:::['7-14-19']
oh, come on, you guys, is it just me? am i overreacting?:::['7-14-20']
no, rach, it is not just you. my 30th birthday certainly wasn't that much fun.:::['7-14-21']
and now chandler.:::['7-14-22']
we're all getting so old.:::['7-14-23']
why are you doing this to us?:::['7-14-24']
rach, you're in a great place in your life. you have an amazing job, good friends.:::['7-14-25']
your roommate's a soap opera star.:::['7-14-26']
your character is in a coma.:::['7-14-27']
i promised myself i wasn't gonna cry at this one.:::['7-14-28']
i know my life's going pretty well, but i see so many people......who've accomplished so many:::['7-14-29']
of their goals by the time they're 30.:::['7-14-30']
yeah, but you shouldn't compare yourself to me.:::['7-14-31']
ross: come on, phoebe. chandler: you can do it.:::['7-14-32']
come on. there you go.:::['7-14-33']
i did it. one mile on a hippity hop.:::['7-14-34']
that's it. that's everything i wanted to do before i was 30.:::['7-14-35']
oh, except i wanted to patch things up with my sister.:::['7-14-36']
oh, well. but, yay!:::['7-14-37']
and, girls, this thing is a godsend, if you know what i mean. heh.:::['7-14-38']
come on, let's have some fun, huh? what do you want to do today?:::['7-14-39']
nothing. i don't want to do anything.:::['7-14-40']
doing nothing on your 30th is better than doing something stupid, like ross.:::['7-14-41']
hey, that was a practical purchase.:::['7-14-42']
i needed that car for transportation.:::['7-14-43']
okay? i have a child.:::['7-14-44']
how hot do i look in this, huh?:::['7-14-45']
ross, a sports car?:::['7-14-46']
wouldn't it be cheaper to just stuff a sock down there?:::['7-14-47']
that's not what this is about, okay?:::['7-14-48']
i am a sports car enthusiast.:::['7-14-49']
i've always been into cars. what's the horsepower on this thing?:::['7-14-50']
i don't know, but look how shiny.:::['7-14-51']
i can't believe you bought this. so can i have a ride, stud?:::['7-14-52']
hop in.:::['7-14-53']
get ready for the smoothest ride of your life.:::['7-14-54']
okay, who's next?:::['7-14-56']
you know what? i am gonna do something today. i'm not just gonna sit around like some old lady.:::['7-14-57']
i want to get something pierced.:::['7-14-58']
like my, uh, nose or my tongue or something.:::['7-14-59']
really? because, you know, that hurts.:::['7-14-60']
so what? you know, the way i see it...:::['7-14-61']
ow! son of a bitch.:::['7-14-62']
look, rachel, i know what you're going through.:::['7-14-63']
i'm totally freaked out about turning 25.:::['7-14-64']
get out of my apartment.:::['7-14-65']
rach, for what it's worth, i think that you're doing great.:::['7-14-66']
i mean, let's face it, no one handles this well.:::['7-14-67']
heh. least of all you.:::['7-14-68']
would you put that back on. monica's gonna be here any minute.:::['7-14-69']
but it hurts my joey's apple.:::['7-14-70']
okay, for the last time, it's not named after each individual man.:::['7-14-71']
you've done a wonderful job with this party, chandler.:::['7-14-72']
everything looks so lovely. oh, well, not as lovely as you.:::['7-14-73']
i mean, i can't believe you would have a 30-year-old daughter.:::['7-14-74']
and you, i can't believe you would have a tux that's 30 years old.:::['7-14-75']
it's older than that. ross was actually conceived right near this tuxedo.:::['7-14-76']
okay, everybody hide. i saw her. she's coming.:::['7-14-78']
okay, okay. everybody down. everybody down.:::['7-14-79']
okay, everybody stay here. i will find out what's going on.:::['7-14-80']
hey, you got the door open.:::['7-14-81']
hey, are you drunk?:::['7-14-82']
see, i was a little nervous about turning...:::['7-14-87']
so the busboys took me out for some drinks.:::['7-14-88']
might want to puke on you later.:::['7-14-89']
okay, here's the thing. we have thrown a very formal surprise party for you.:::['7-14-90']
all your friends are in there and your parents.:::['7-14-91']
no. yes.:::['7-14-92']
oh, no. my parents have never seen me drunk.:::['7-14-93']
that they know of.:::['7-14-94']
here's the thing. we'll get you some coffee and they will never know that you're drunk.:::['7-14-95']
really, you promise? yeah, i'll take care of it.:::['7-14-96']
okay, we have to do something about your breath.:::['7-14-98']
what about your breath?:::['7-14-99']
that's still yours.:::['7-14-100']
okay, now, remember, it's a surprise party.:::['7-14-101']
so when you go in, act surprised.:::['7-14-102']
okay. okay. shh.:::['7-14-103']
ready?:::['7-14-104', '5-10-212', '4-8-114']
okay, forward. forward.:::['7-14-106']
stop!:::['7-14-107']
okay, back... stop!:::['7-14-108']
okay, for... stop! stop! stop!:::['7-14-109']
okay. okay, here's what we're gonna do.:::['7-14-110']
i'm gonna break into this minivan, put it in neutral.:::['7-14-111']
you guys push it forward so ross can drive out of the spot.:::['7-14-112']
okay? all right. here we go.:::['7-14-113']
haul ass!:::['7-14-114']
happy 30th birthday. here.:::['7-14-115']
it's for the child in you. and the woman.:::['7-14-116']
happy 30th.:::['7-14-117']
why do you keep saying that?:::['7-14-118']
because it's our 30th birthday.:::['7-14-119']
yeah, no, we're not 30. we're 31. okay.:::['7-14-120']
oh, it's you.:::['7-14-122']
yeah. what?:::['7-14-123']
yeah, we're not 30. we're 31.:::['7-14-124']
yuh-huh. that's what it says on my birth certificate.:::['7-14-126']
you have your birth certificate?:::['7-14-127']
yeah, i got a big box of family stuff when my mom died.:::['7-14-128']
our mom.:::['7-14-129']
right. okay.:::['7-14-130', '5-24-88', '3-2-267', '3-10-106']
do you have my birth certificate? no, i sold it to a swedish runaway.:::['7-14-131']
oh, my god, we are 31.:::['7-14-133']
i just lost a whole year of my life.:::['7-14-135']
your middle name is pamela? yes.:::['7-14-137']
oh, i never knew mine. do you remember what it is?:::['7-14-138']
yes. phoebe.:::['7-14-139']
that's my first name. right. okay. then, no.:::['7-14-140']
look at that. we made it all the way across the room. you're doing great.:::['7-14-141']
what's going on? monica's a little drunk.:::['7-14-142']
yay, i love drunk monica.:::['7-14-143']
oh, she's so much more fun than regular monica.:::['7-14-144']
she doesn't want her parents to know she's drunk.:::['7-14-145']
oh, all right, all right. here's what we'll do.:::['7-14-146']
i'll get twice as drunk as monica and then no one's even gonna notice her.:::['7-14-147']
rachel: what's going on?:::['7-14-148', '5-19-32', '5-5-40']
monica's wasted.:::['7-14-149']
maybe that'll liven up this party.:::['7-14-150']
okay, will you just go help her get changed, please?:::['7-14-151']
okay, but taking care of a drunk, naked woman seems like a job for joey.:::['7-14-152']
this one's from me. ah.:::['7-14-154']
it wasn't on your list, but hopefully you'll think it's really fun.:::['7-14-155']
a scooter.:::['7-14-156']
stick to the list.:::['7-14-157']
always stick to the list.:::['7-14-158']
no, no, no, i love it. thank you.:::['7-14-159']
okay, open ours next. open ours next.:::['7-14-160']
now that you're a couple, we don't get two presents from you?:::['7-14-161']
for my last birthday, you gave me a hug.:::['7-14-162']
okay, read the card, read the card. okay.:::['7-14-163']
"happy birthday, grandma.:::['7-14-164']
it's better to be over the hill......than buried under it.:::['7-14-165']
monica and chandler." that's funny.:::['7-14-166']
no, no, no, no. that was a joke.:::['7-14-167']
i know, i get it. it's funny.:::['7-14-168']
no, because you're not a grandmother.:::['7-14-169']
i know, because to be a grandmother, you have to be married and have children.:::['7-14-170']
i don't have any of those things. that's why it's so funny.:::['7-14-171']
i'm just gonna go...:::['7-14-172']
all you had to do was buy the card.:::['7-14-173']
okay, you know what?:::['7-14-174']
it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids.:::['7-14-175']
all i really needed was a plan.:::['7-14-176']
see, i wanna have three kids.:::['7-14-177']
let me guess. and you want to have them all at the same time... ...and you want to have them for your brother. ha, ha.:::['7-14-178']
as i was saying...:::['7-14-179']
i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i'm 35, right?:::['7-14-180']
which gives me five years.:::['7-14-181']
so if i wanna have a kid when i'm 35, i don't have to get pregnant until i'm 34.:::['7-14-182']
which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes.:::['7-14-183']
oh, wait, but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant.:::['7-14-184']
really? that long?:::['7-14-185']
look all you want, it's happening.:::['7-14-186']
so i don't have to get married until i'm 33. that's three years. that's three whole years.:::['7-14-187']
oh, wait a minute though.:::['7-14-188']
i'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding.:::['7-14-189']
and i'd like to know the guy for like a year, year and a half......before we get engaged.:::['7-14-190']
which means i need to meet the guy by the time i'm 30.:::['7-14-191']
which is fine, because you just turned...:::['7-14-192']
no, ross. no, it is not fine.:::['7-14-193']
according to my plan, i should already be with the guy that i'm gonna marry.:::['7-14-194']
will you quit hogging it?:::['7-14-195']
oh, i'm telling you, it's like watching bambi learn how to walk.:::['7-14-196']

i want to make love to you right here, right now.:::['7-14-204']
i really wish that you wouldn't.:::['7-14-205']
all you have to do is just get through a little bit more, okay?:::['7-14-206']
then we can put you in bed, okay? just smile and don't talk to anyone.:::['7-14-207']
speech, speech. let's hear from the birthday girl, huh?:::['7-14-208']

speech. come on, speech.:::['7-14-213']

hey, chandler, you can't keep your hands off her for one second.:::['7-14-215']
oh, i think it's nice.:::['7-14-216']
i think it's necessary.:::['7-14-217']
i wanna thank you all for coming.:::['7-14-218']
my family and my friends.:::['7-14-219']
whoo-hoo.:::['7-14-220']
i'd really like to say that i'm, um...:::['7-14-221']
you know what i'd really like to say?:::['7-14-222']
i'm drunk.:::['7-14-223']
that's right, mom and dad.:::['7-14-224']
your little "harmomica" is hammered.:::['7-14-225']
and guess what? i've been drunk before.:::['7-14-226']
and i've smoked a cigarette.:::['7-14-227']
but you know what? you know what?:::['7-14-228']
it's all okay. it's okay, because i turned 30 today.:::['7-14-229']
and i can do anything i want.:::['7-14-230']
because i am a grownup.:::['7-14-231']
okay, quick. help me get this off. yeah.:::['7-14-232']
i lost a whole year.:::['7-14-233']
i can't believe it. this is so unfair.:::['7-14-234']
come on, pheebs, it'll be okay.:::['7-14-235']
will it? will it?:::['7-14-236']
how would you feel if you found out you were 31?:::['7-14-237']
that's not gonna happen, you know, because we have a new deal.:::['7-14-238']
plus, it totally ruined my schedule.:::['7-14-239']
i haven't done any of the things i wanted to do by the time i was 31.:::['7-14-240']
like what? like, okay... ...i haven't met any portuguese people.:::['7-14-241']
i haven't had the perfect kiss.:::['7-14-242']
and i haven't been to sniper school.:::['7-14-243']
phoebe, why don't we go upstairs and have some birthday cake?:::['7-14-244']
no, i just feel like being by myself for a while, all right? i'll see you guys later. thanks.:::['7-14-245']

pheebs. wait up.:::['7-14-250']
listen, i...:::['7-14-251']
close your eyes.:::['7-14-252']
maybe that's one you can cross off your list.:::['7-14-253']
oh, yeah. heh.:::['7-14-254']
oh, and plus, i'm one-sixteenth portuguese.:::['7-14-255']
okay, is everybody clear? we're gonna pick it up......and move it.:::['7-14-256']
all we need is teamwork, okay? we're gonna lift the car......and slide it out.:::['7-14-257']
lift......and slide.:::['7-14-258', '7-14-261']
ross, i really don't think this... lift......and slide.:::['7-14-259']
okay, here we go. ross: all right, everyone.:::['7-14-260']
hey, joey... oh, come on, rach, my turn just started.:::['7-14-262']
actually, i just want to talk to tag.:::['7-14-263']
oh, okay. hey, can i ride this outside?:::['7-14-264']

uh, tag, um...:::['7-14-271']
you're such a great guy, and we have so much fun together.:::['7-14-272']
but i... wait.:::['7-14-273']
i think i see where you're going.:::['7-14-274']
but before you say anything else, can i just say one more thing?:::['7-14-275']
well said.:::['7-14-276']
and a, uh, good example of the fun i was referring to.:::['7-14-277']
uh, but, heh, i think i'm past the point where i can, you know, just have fun.:::['7-14-278']
rachel, don't do this. this is just because you're turning 30.:::['7-14-279']
yeah, it is.:::['7-14-280']
but you're just a kid. i mean, you're 25.:::['7-14-281']
twenty-four, actually. oh, god.:::['7-14-282']
you know what i wish? i wish you were six years older.:::['7-14-283']
well, actually, if i'm wishing for stuff, i actually wish i was six years younger.:::['7-14-284']
me too. yeah. i'm sorry.:::['7-14-285']
hey, how'd it go?:::['7-14-286']
if i only want two kids, can i keep him for another year?:::['7-14-288']
you did the right thing.:::['7-14-289']
i don't like this anymore.:::['7-14-290']
well, here we are. just a bunch of 30-year-olds.:::['7-14-291']
wow, do you realize in 10 years we're gonna be 40?:::['7-14-292']
why, god? why are you doing this to us?:::['7-14-293']
yes. my baby's finally free.:::['7-14-294']
start it up. let's go.:::['7-14-296']
ross: whoo-hoo!:::['7-14-297']
how hot are we?:::['7-14-298']
you wanna buy a car?:::['7-14-299']
hi. hi! hi, ben.:::['7-16-0']
hi. we have a bathroom emergency.:::['7-16-1']
oh, yeah. go ahead. okay, uh, before we do......uh, are any of joey's special:::['7-16-2']
romance magazines in there?:::['7-16-3']
no. okay, all clear.:::['7-16-4']
ben: thanks, phoebe.:::['7-16-5']
that's rachel.:::['7-16-6']
but whatever. mm-hm.:::['7-16-7']
could you do me a big favor?:::['7-16-8']
the, uh, dean's office called and said there was an urgent meeting.:::['7-16-9']
can you watch ben for an hour?:::['7-16-10']
well, what about monica? uh, she isn't home.:::['7-16-11']
so it would just be me alone?:::['7-16-12']
well, ben would be there. no...:::['7-16-13']
huh. um...:::['7-16-14']
what's the matter? well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...:::['7-16-15']
i've never done that before. me and him, alone.:::['7-16-16']
he's not an ex-con.:::['7-16-17']
okay, okay, okay. um...:::['7-16-18']
what do i do with him? i don't know, talk to him.:::['7-16-19']
entertain him. keep him alive.:::['7-16-20']
okay. ross: okay, ben, come here.:::['7-16-21']
i'm gonna leave you here with aunt rachel for about an hour, okay?:::['7-16-22']
gonna be okay?:::['7-16-23']
i think so. i wasn't talking to you.:::['7-16-24']
what about the second minister? i kind of liked him.:::['7-16-25']
you mean the spitter? come on. he wasn't that bad.:::['7-16-26']
easy for you to say, you'd be wearing a veil.:::['7-16-27']
and the third guy? he kept staring at your chest.:::['7-16-28']
can you blame him?:::['7-16-29']
i don't like the idea of me saying, "i do"......while he's thinking, "i'd do it too.":::['7-16-30']
well, then we still have a problem. with what?:::['7-16-31']
we need someone to perform our wedding......and they're all either:::['7-16-32']
boring or annoying......or keep staring at the ladies.:::['7-16-33']
ooh, you should have one of us do it.:::['7-16-34']
we're getting "married" married, not "6th-grade" married.:::['7-16-35']
no, it's a real thing.:::['7-16-36']
anyone can be ordained on the internet and perform weddings and stuff.:::['7-16-37']
i call it!:::['7-16-38']
what? it was my idea!:::['7-16-39']
thank you very much, but neither of you is marrying us.:::['7-16-40']
does calling it not mean anything anymore?:::['7-16-41']
we're having a legitimate clergy member.:::['7-16-42']
and when i say legitimate, i mean gay......and in control of his saliva.:::['7-16-43']
ben, you know, when, uh... when you were a baby......we'd hang out all the time.:::['7-16-44']
because i was your daddy's girlfriend.:::['7-16-45']
but you're not anymore.:::['7-16-46']
no, i'm not. because you guys were on a break...:::['7-16-47']
hey, we were not on a... okay.:::['7-16-48']
when's my daddy coming back? fifty-two minutes.:::['7-16-49']
so no brothers or sisters, huh?:::['7-16-50']
you know what, i had two sisters and we just tortured each other.:::['7-16-51']
really? like how? well, you know, we would, um...:::['7-16-52']
we'd repeat everything the other said......or, uh, we'd jump out of closets:::['7-16-53']
to scare each other......or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt:::['7-16-54']
so they put salt on their cereal.:::['7-16-55']
that's a good one.:::['7-16-56']
yeah, you like that one? yeah, you're funny.:::['7-16-57']
i'm funny?:::['7-16-58']
oh, thank god.:::['7-16-59', '7-12-61', '5-20-23', '5-21-322']
well, hey, i got a ton of these.:::['7-16-60']
um, you, uh... you take a quarter... you take a quarter......and you blacken the edge, right?:::['7-16-61']
and then you say, "i bet you can't roll this quarter......to your chin without it leaving your face.":::['7-16-62']
and when they do it, they're left with a line down the center of their face.:::['7-16-63']
can i do it to you?:::['7-16-64']
yeah, i'm funny, ben, but i'm not stupid.:::['7-16-65']
heh, okay?:::['7-16-66']
so did you, uh, find anyone to marry you guys yet?:::['7-16-67']
no, but "horny for monica" minister called......wondering if we're still together.:::['7-16-68']
we'll never find anybody. then let me do it.:::['7-16-69']
joe... no, i've been thinking.:::['7-16-70']
i'm an actor, so i won't get nervous in front of people.:::['7-16-71']
i won't spit and i won't stare at monica's breasts.:::['7-16-72']
everyone knows i'm an ass man.:::['7-16-73']
that is true. and the most important thing......is it won't be some stranger:::['7-16-74']
who barely knows you.:::['7-16-75']
it'll be me. and i swear, i'll do a really good job.:::['7-16-76']
plus, i love you guys and it would really mean a lot to me.:::['7-16-77']
might be kind of cool.:::['7-16-78']
so i can do it? yeah, you can do it.:::['7-16-79']
all right! okay!:::['7-16-80']
okay, i gotta get started on my speech.:::['7-16-81']
internet ministers can still have sex? yeah.:::['7-16-83']
coming.:::['7-16-84']
i have a bone to pick with you.:::['7-16-85']
uh-oh. yes.:::['7-16-86']
ben learned a little trick.:::['7-16-87']
oh, did he pull the old...? that's right, that's right.:::['7-16-88']
saran wrap on the toilet seat......so the pee goes everywhere.:::['7-16-89']
oh, that. yeah, that.:::['7-16-90']
you know i hate practical jokes.:::['7-16-91']
they're mean, they're stupid and i don't want my son learning them.:::['7-16-92']
oh, come on. saran wrap on the toilet seat? isn't that just a little funny?:::['7-16-93']
i was barefoot. oh.:::['7-16-94']
tell me, the toilet thing is the only thing you taught him, right?:::['7-16-95']
hey. say hello to reverend joey tribbiani.:::['7-16-97']
you got ordained? joey: yeah.:::['7-16-98']
just got off the internet. man, there's a lot of porn out there.:::['7-16-99']
our minister.:::['7-16-100']
i started on what i'm gonna say for the ceremony. want to hear it?:::['7-16-101']
yeah. listen, this is just the first draft, so...:::['7-16-102']
"we are gathered here today on this joyous occasion......to celebrate the special love:::['7-16-103']
that monica and chandler share.:::['7-16-104']
huh? right.:::['7-16-105']
it is a love based on giving and receiving......as well as having and sharing.:::['7-16-106']
and the love that they give and have is shared and received.:::['7-16-107']
and through this having and giving......and sharing and receiving......we too can share and love and have......and receive.":::['7-16-108']
should we call the spitter?:::['7-16-109']
ha! hey, rachel. hi.:::['7-16-110']
what a surprise. what are you doing here?:::['7-16-111']
i was just in the neighborhood......and i passed by your building:::['7-16-112']
and thought, "what's up with carol......and sweet little ben?":::['7-16-113']
that's nice. well, uh, come on in. okay.:::['7-16-114']
um, i'll make some coffee and, uh, we can chat.:::['7-16-115']
i'd love that. i would love that.:::['7-16-116']
so, uh... so where is sweet little ben?:::['7-16-117']
i would love to have a little...:::['7-16-118']
i found him!:::['7-16-119']
very funny. come here.:::['7-16-120']
that is exactly why i've come here to talk to you, okay?:::['7-16-121']
carol: rach, you want some sugar? yes, but...:::['7-16-122']
do i want sugar in my coffee?:::['7-16-123']
no, just some milk would be good, carol. thanks.:::['7-16-124']
okay. remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday?:::['7-16-125']
"remember all that stuff i taught you yesterday?":::['7-16-126']
don't do that. "don't do that.":::['7-16-127']
your dad doesn't like pranks. "your dad doesn't like pranks.":::['7-16-128']
oh, damn it. "oh, damn it!":::['7-16-129']
no! don't say that.:::['7-16-130']
damn it! go back to repeating.:::['7-16-131']
damn it! oh, crap.:::['7-16-132']
"oh, crap!" oh.:::['7-16-133']
okay, i got some more written, ready?:::['7-16-134']
"when i think of the love that these two givers and receivers share......i can't help but envy the lifetime:::['7-16-136']
ahead of having and loving......and giving..." and then i can't:::['7-16-137']
think of a good word for right here.:::['7-16-138']
how about "receiving"? yes!:::['7-16-139']
see, joe, not that that's not great......but one cool thing about having:::['7-16-140']
a friend perform the ceremony......is that it can be about us.:::['7-16-141']
it can be more personal. you can tell stories about us.:::['7-16-142']
ooh, ooh.:::['7-16-143', '5-8-271']
uh, okay. maybe i'll talk about london. you know, when you two hooked up.:::['7-16-144']
only i won't say "hooked up"......i'll say, "began their beautiful journey...:::['7-16-145']
there you go. ...by doing it.":::['7-16-146']
joe. okay, all right, um...:::['7-16-147']
so, uh... so how did it happen? did your eyes meet across the room......then you're in the bathtub:::['7-16-148']
and she's feeding you strawberries?:::['7-16-149']
isn't that what happened to you? yeah!:::['7-16-150']
i call that "london style.":::['7-16-151']
that didn't happen with us.:::['7-16-152']
ooh, but maybe you should say it is, because "london style" sounds nice.:::['7-16-153']
i was sad that night because this guy thought i was ross' mom.:::['7-16-156']
and chandler was really sweet and he consoled me......and we drank too much.:::['7-16-158']
yeah, baby.:::['7-16-159', '7-16-221', '3-13-32']
i was a gentleman and i walked her to her hotel room and said good night.:::['7-16-160']
but then, later that night... yeah, baby.:::['7-16-162']
cute p.j.s. really living it up here in london, huh?:::['7-16-164']
well, i wasn't exactly expecting company after...:::['7-16-165']
is joey here?:::['7-16-166']
last i saw he was with a bridesmaid and a bucket of strawberries.:::['7-16-167']
so, uh, you're not still upset about what that guy told you, are you?:::['7-16-168']
wouldn't you be?:::['7-16-169']
it's been a really emotional time and you've had a lot to drink...:::['7-16-170']
you have to let that go, okay?:::['7-16-171']
you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...:::['7-16-174']
whoa, whoa, whoa. what's going on? we just made out.:::['7-16-175']
we're making out? not anymore.:::['7-16-176']
but we don't do that. i know, i thought it would be fun.:::['7-16-177']
how drunk are you?:::['7-16-178']
enough to know i want to do this. not so much that you should feel guilty.:::['7-16-179']
that's the perfect amount.:::['7-16-180']
want to get under the covers? mm-hm.:::['7-16-184']
wow, you are really fast!:::['7-16-186']
at the same time? count of three?:::['7-16-189']
one, two, three.:::['7-16-190', '2-18-263', '5-22-120', '3-12-175']
well, i think it's safe to say our friendship is effectively ruined.:::['7-16-191']
eh, we weren't that close anyway. eh.:::['7-16-192']
joey, joey, joey. it's joey.:::['7-16-193']
hey, joe. i was just watching a movie...:::['7-16-195']
oh, dude, i'm so sorry.:::['7-16-196']
it's cool, i'm still with my bridesmaid.:::['7-16-198']
where are the condoms?:::['7-16-199']
in my bag over there.:::['7-16-200']
uh......could you leave me one?:::['7-16-202']
for just you?:::['7-16-203']
all right. there you go, buddy.:::['7-16-205']
go nuts.:::['7-16-206']
that's what that was?:::['7-16-207']
can you imagine if i hadn't left you that last one?:::['7-16-208']
you two might've never gotten together.:::['7-16-209']
oh, ooh. can you imagine if i had sent that hooker up, like i was gonna?:::['7-16-210']
it's like it was in the stars. chandler: hmm.:::['7-16-211']
yeah, totally meant to be.:::['7-16-212']
tell him who you originally wanted to hook up with that night.:::['7-16-213']
who did you originally want to hook up with?:::['7-16-216']
okay, fine, but please don't be upset.:::['7-16-217']
i was really depressed, okay? and really drunk.:::['7-16-218']
i wanted something stupid and meaningless. i just wanted sex.:::['7-16-219']
so when i went to your room that night......i was actually looking for joey.:::['7-16-220']
no, baby.:::['7-16-222']
you came looking for joey?:::['7-16-224']
were you planning on telling me this? no, i didn't think it was important.:::['7-16-225']
it's not important? it's not important?:::['7-16-226']
if it wasn't for a bridesmaid, you'd be marrying him.:::['7-16-227']
no! do you know how unbelievably glad i am that joey wasn't there?:::['7-16-228']
i'm a man of the cloth but i still have feelings.:::['7-16-230']
there's no way you're doing this wedding now, okay?:::['7-16-231']
what? that's not fair. it's not my fault.:::['7-16-232']
i was with my bridesmaid.:::['7-16-233']
and who's to say i would've said yes?:::['7-16-234']
i mean, i would've said yes.:::['7-16-235']
look, you are making way too big a deal out of this.:::['7-16-236']
everything worked out okay.:::['7-16-237']
it's just weird, okay?:::['7-16-238']
i don't want to be saying my vows with the mental image of you and monica.:::['7-16-239']
i need... i don't know what i need. i need a walk.:::['7-16-240']
wait, chandler, it's not a big deal. it is to me.:::['7-16-241']
you wanted to sleep with batman and settled for robin.:::['7-16-242']
this is crazy. no, robin is so gay.:::['7-16-243']
so now what have we agreed? no more pranks.:::['7-16-244']
what else? you and daddy were not on a break.:::['7-16-245']
rachel, what are you doing here?:::['7-16-247']
i'm just visiting my good friend carol.:::['7-16-248']
your good friend? yeah.:::['7-16-249']
what's her last name?:::['7-16-250']
carol......lesbian.:::['7-16-251']
by the way, that, uh... that line down my face...:::['7-16-253']
the line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say::::['7-16-254']
"dude, don't you ever wash your face?":::['7-16-255']
i'm sorry i didn't tell you.:::['7-16-256']
i don't want you teaching my son that stuff anymore.:::['7-16-257']
okay? fine. fine.:::['7-16-258']
once i taught him that stuff, he called me "fun aunt rachel.":::['7-16-259']
and i loved being fun aunt rachel.:::['7-16-260']
i'm glad you guys were bonding but...:::['7-16-261']
look, he doesn't have any siblings.:::['7-16-262']
somebody has to teach him this stuff.:::['7-16-263']
i haven't taught him anything a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.:::['7-16-264']
ben: crap! i gotta go.:::['7-16-265']
you want this scone? it came for me but it would rather sleep with you.:::['7-16-267']
nothing even happened.:::['7-16-268']
i just... i don't want you to be upset.:::['7-16-269']
how can i not be upset?:::['7-16-270']
i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman......and it turns out she wanted you first.:::['7-16-271']
yeah, for like a half an hour one night.:::['7-16-272']
chandler, she wants you for the rest of her life.:::['7-16-273']
we look at you and we see you together, and it just...:::['7-16-274']
it fits, you know?:::['7-16-275']
and you just know it's gonna last forever.:::['7-16-276']
that's what you should say.:::['7-16-277']
when you're marrying us, that's what you should say.:::['7-16-279']
really? i could do it?:::['7-16-280']
i'd love you to do it.:::['7-16-281']
but those are the words. those exact words.:::['7-16-283']
well, i don't remember exactly......but it's pretty much about having:::['7-16-284']
and giving and sharing and receiving.:::['7-16-285']
so you guys doing okay? chandler: yeah.:::['7-16-287']
we talked and monica made me see that i overreacted a little bit.:::['7-16-288']
some things are more important. yeah, baby.:::['7-16-289']
i'm really glad you guys are okay, but i just keep thinking......what would've happened:::['7-16-290']
if you two had hooked up.:::['7-16-291']
honey, dinner's ready!:::['7-16-292']
what's my little chef got for me tonight?:::['7-16-293']

hey. hey!:::['7-16-303', '4-6-269']
i'm sorry to do this again, but could you look after ben for a bit?:::['7-16-304']
i've got this meeting at school......and he asked for his "fun aunt rachel.":::['7-16-305']
well, of course i will watch him.:::['7-16-306']

but this block is like a whole other world.:::['7-17-25']
actually, it does have a very interesting history.:::['7-17-26']
this street is the first street in the city to have an underground sewer system.:::['7-17-27']
before that, sewage and waste......would just flow:::['7-17-28']
right down the street. yeah.:::['7-17-29']
sometimes ankle-deep.:::['7-17-30']
smooth.:::['7-17-31']
you're gonna be starving after moving. what do you say i take you to dinner tonight?:::['7-17-33']
i'd like that. yeah? great.:::['7-17-34']

we've gotta get monica. you gotta hold my hand!:::['7-17-117']
excuse me! excuse me!:::['7-17-119']
hey. go!:::['7-17-121']
so, ross, how was your date the other night?:::['7-17-122']
did you tell her about the magical ride that starts with the flush of every toilet?:::['7-17-123']
laugh all you want, but she left me a message saying she'd like to go out again.:::['7-17-124']
oh. in fact, i'll go call her right now.:::['7-17-125']
and i'll make sure and tell her my friend chandler says...:::['7-17-126']
hey, chandler. hey.:::['7-17-127', '7-13-223']
sorry i didn't stop by last night, but i had a date.:::['7-17-128']
joe, when it's 1:00 in the morning and you don't come by? that's okay.:::['7-17-129']
check it out. it was with this really hot girl who just moved in right across the street.:::['7-17-130']
really? right across the street? yeah.:::['7-17-131']
when did you meet her? two days ago.:::['7-17-132']
you know, ross met somebody too. oh, yeah?:::['7-17-134']
hey. how'd it go?:::['7-17-135']
great. we're going out again saturday.:::['7-17-136']
but i found out she's also seeing some other guy.:::['7-17-137']
joe, what would you do if you were in ross' situation?:::['7-17-139']
well, i sort of am. i'm dating this girl who's also seeing another guy.:::['7-17-140']
but i'm not too worried about it.:::['7-17-141']
you shouldn't be. believe me, i wouldn't want to be the guy who's up against you.:::['7-17-142']
i mean, that doofus is going to lose.:::['7-17-143']
so this is nice.:::['7-17-144']
i wish i didn't have to go. believe me.:::['7-17-145']
but i have to.:::['7-17-146']
by the way, what's the name of the girl you're dating?:::['7-17-147']
ross & joey: kristen leigh. bye.:::['7-17-148']
well, obviously, only one of us can keep dating her.:::['7-17-149']
obviously. so how do we decide?:::['7-17-150']
well now, let's look at this objectively.:::['7-17-151']
i think i should date her.:::['7-17-152']
uh-huh. uh-huh.:::['7-17-153', '5-12-90']
or i'm the one who dates her.:::['7-17-154']
that's interesting. but check this out. i date her.:::['7-17-155']
yeah, i like that. but just to go in another direction...:::['7-17-156']
okay. this can go on for a while.:::['7-17-157']
we should order some food then. no, joey.:::['7-17-158']
look, why don't we just let her decide, okay?:::['7-17-159']
we'll each go out with her one more time.:::['7-17-160']
and we'll see who she likes best.:::['7-17-161']
that sounds fair.:::['7-17-162']
maybe i'll take her to that new french restaurant down the street.:::['7-17-163']
wait a second. we have to set a spending limit on the date.:::['7-17-164']
i don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.:::['7-17-165']
well, sorry. that's what i do on dates.:::['7-17-166']
all right. well, i guess i'll just have to do what i do on dates.:::['7-17-167']
so let's decide on a spending limit. yeah.:::['7-17-168']
and a slice...:::['7-17-170']
six dollars?:::['7-17-171']
i was thinking more like a hundred. okay.:::['7-17-172']
can i borrow 94 dollars?:::['7-17-173']
i know. can you hand me a tissue?:::['7-17-175']
you're out of diet coke.:::['7-17-176']
what? you what?:::['7-17-178']
you listen here, missy!:::['7-17-179']
that was megan. she booked the swing kings on the day of our wedding......and said she'd only:::['7-17-181']
give them back for the dress!:::['7-17-182']
does that mean carcass is available?:::['7-17-183']
what am i gonna do? that's the dress! that is "the" dress!:::['7-17-184']
chandler wants the band. what do i do?:::['7-17-185']
figure out a way to talk him out of it. how?:::['7-17-186']
rachel: you're out of toilet paper!:::['7-17-187']
i wanted to wish you good luck on your date.:::['7-17-189']
thanks. what time are you meeting?:::['7-17-190']
we have 8:00 reservations at grand merci bistro.:::['7-17-191']
that's in 20 minutes. you'd better get dressed.:::['7-17-192']
i am dressed. oh, well, good.:::['7-17-193']
for me.:::['7-17-194', '2-11-146']
what's this? did you give yourself a facial?:::['7-17-195']
i have an oily t-zone.:::['7-17-196']
okay, dude.:::['7-17-197']
hey, you sent kristen flowers? that's right.:::['7-17-198']
you spent 100 dollars. that's the limit. you're screwed!:::['7-17-199']
actually, i sent the flowers before the actual date, so technically......technically, i didn't break any rules.:::['7-17-200']
thanks for stopping by though.:::['7-17-201']
that's how it's gonna be? i can break the rules too.:::['7-17-202']
what are you gonna do? i don't know.:::['7-17-203']
i'm not surprised. you won't get away with this.:::['7-17-204']
you don't have much choice. we'll see!:::['7-17-205']
bye-bye. yeah, bye-bye.:::['7-17-206']
hey! so just a light layer?:::['7-17-207']
yeah, just here and there.:::['7-17-208']
joey got meat sauce on the banister again.:::['7-17-209']
swing music is so out.:::['7-17-210']
phoebe, he's gotta be in the room for that to work.:::['7-17-211']
what are you guys talking about?:::['7-17-212']
we're talking about the swing kings......and whether they're:::['7-17-213']
the right way to go.:::['7-17-214']
i went to a wedding where they had swing music......and two months later:::['7-17-215']
the couple divorced.:::['7-17-216']
i'm not saying there's any connection here......but they did tell me:::['7-17-217']
that's why they got divorced.:::['7-17-218']
but i love swing music!:::['7-17-219']
but the swing kings?:::['7-17-220']
they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts. they just stop living.:::['7-17-221']
when monica and i went to see them, we had fun.:::['7-17-222']
and there's another reason.:::['7-17-223']
well, what is the other reason? i don't want to say.:::['7-17-224']
well, you have to, because maybe it's stupid.:::['7-17-225']
it's just while monica and i were dancing to them......it was the first time:::['7-17-226']
i knew that......you were the woman that i wanted:::['7-17-227']
to dance all my dances with.:::['7-17-228']
our table will be ready in just a few minutes. oh, great.:::['7-17-230']
is your back feeling better? yeah, it's fine.:::['7-17-231']
i guess, ahem, the more muscles you have......the more they can:::['7-17-232']
spasm out of control.:::['7-17-233']
kristen? joey!:::['7-17-234']
joey: hi. kristen: hi.:::['7-17-235']
what are you doing here? i like this place.:::['7-17-236']
and technically, technically, i'm not breaking any rules, so...:::['7-17-237']
well, ross, this is joey. joey, ross.:::['7-17-238']
hi. hi. it's nice to meet you.:::['7-17-239']
i used to have a friend named joey.:::['7-17-240']
i don't anymore.:::['7-17-241']
our table will be ready in a couple minutes.:::['7-17-242']
sure! i would love to wait with you guys! thanks!:::['7-17-243']
so joey, you look familiar.:::['7-17-244']
are you on tv or something?:::['7-17-245']
joey doesn't like to talk about it......but he's one of the stars:::['7-17-246']
of days of our lives.:::['7-17-247']
that's right. that's right. don't you play a woman?:::['7-17-248']
a woman in a man's body.:::['7-17-249']
much better.:::['7-17-250']
so, ross, it's funny, because you look familiar to me too.:::['7-17-251']
have you ever been married?:::['7-17-252']
yes, i have.:::['7-17-253']
in fact, just the other day......kris and i talked about how:::['7-17-254']
i've been married and have a son.:::['7-17-255']
yeah, little eric. that's right. wait. no, ben.:::['7-17-256']
so you've just been married the one time then?:::['7-17-257']
well, um... you've been married twice?:::['7-17-258']
yes. and......another time after that.:::['7-17-259']
boy, i'm getting hungry.:::['7-17-260']
ahem. hey, joey, have you ever been so hungry on a date......that when the girl goes to the:::['7-17-261']
bathroom, you eat some of her food?:::['7-17-262']
you said the waiter ate my crab cake.:::['7-17-263']
so, ross, now why did that first marriage break up? hm?:::['7-17-264']
was it because the woman was straight or because she was a lesbian?:::['7-17-265']
do you two know each other? ross & joey: no.:::['7-17-266']
but he seems like a guy who'd marry a woman......on the verge of being a lesbian:::['7-17-267']
and then push her over the edge.:::['7-17-268']
wait a minute! were you on a poster for gonorrhea?:::['7-17-269']
have you ever slept in the same bed with a monkey?:::['7-17-270']
hey, you leave marcel out of this!:::['7-17-271']
fine! you ever gotten stuck in a pair of your own leather pants?:::['7-17-272']
hey, hey! have you ever locked yourself in a tv cabinet, vd-boy?:::['7-17-273']
monkey-lover!:::['7-17-274']
where do you think we lost her?:::['7-17-275']
probably around "gonorrhea.":::['7-17-276']
hi, honey, i'm home! monica: don't come in here!:::['7-17-277']
why, do you have another boyfriend in there?:::['7-17-278']
monica: no. we only mess around at his place.:::['7-17-279']
it's funny, i started it, but now it's scaring me, so could you come out here, please?:::['7-17-280']
monica: no. i'm wearing a wedding dress.:::['7-17-281']
you got a wedding dress? that's great.:::['7-17-282']
monica: yeah, but i'm not keeping it. then why can't i see it?:::['7-17-283']
monica: oh. i guess you can.:::['7-17-284']
but i have to return it, so you can't like it.:::['7-17-285']
okay, i promise. i'll hate it.:::['7-17-286']
wow. you look hideous.:::['7-17-287']
yeah. that's like the most ugliest dress i've ever seen.:::['7-17-289']
why do you have to return it?:::['7-17-290']
because it doesn't really fit.:::['7-17-291']
oh, by the way, i booked the swing kings.:::['7-17-292']
oh, that's great. great. thanks.:::['7-17-293']
but that dress, i mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.:::['7-17-294']
it makes me want to rip it right off you. okay.:::['7-17-295']
but you can't rip it.:::['7-17-296']
well, maybe a little. okay.:::['7-17-297']
hey, guys, you want to look at the song list for the wedding?:::['7-17-298']
chandler: i thought you'd be gone all day.:::['7-17-300']
all right, what's going on?:::['7-17-301', '2-5-164']
i'm sorry. i should probably leave you girls alone.:::['7-17-302']
laugh all you want, but in 10 minutes we'll have younger-looking skin.:::['7-17-303']
yeah. right there.:::['7-17-304']
you know, she could use a little...:::['7-17-305']
oh, nice shot! yeah! oh! oh! oh!:::['7-17-306']
hey. what are you doing? hi.:::['7-13-0']
well, you know, i was thinking of moving the couch over here.:::['7-13-1']
why would you want to do that?:::['7-13-2']
so that there would be a decent place for me to sit?:::['7-13-3']
rach, there is a decent place. and your lap does not count.:::['7-13-4']
okay? come on, help me move this. no, no, no.:::['7-13-5']
no? no.:::['7-13-6']
rosita does not move.:::['7-13-7']
i'm sorry. rosita? as in...?:::['7-13-8']
as in "rosita does not move.":::['7-13-9']
joey, it's just a chair. what's the big deal?:::['7-13-10']
the big deal is that it's the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen......and it's at the perfect angle so you:::['7-13-11']
don't get any glare coming off of stevie.:::['7-13-12']
stevie the tv?:::['7-13-13']
is there a problem? no.:::['7-13-14']
oh, what does he know?:::['7-13-15']
come on, rosita. us chicas gotta stick together.:::['7-13-16']
hey, ross?:::['7-13-19', '5-19-319']
so i was checking out the real-estate section.:::['7-13-20']
yeah. look at this.:::['7-13-21']
oh, looks like mom and dad's house.:::['7-13-22']
oh, it even has a tree with a broken limb out front.:::['7-13-23']
and the, uh, window in the attic...:::['7-13-24']
what? what happened to the window in the attic?:::['7-13-26']
i can't believe mom and dad are selling the house. i can't believe they didn't even tell us.:::['7-13-27']
i can't believe i still don't know what happened to the window in the attic.:::['7-13-28']
okay, come on. i'll buy you a new one, all right?:::['7-13-29']
we'll go down to the store right now and we'll get you a new chair.:::['7-13-30']
she's not even cold yet.:::['7-13-31']
but don't you think rosita would've wanted you to move on?:::['7-13-32']
i mean, you know, she did always put your comfort first.:::['7-13-33']
i can't believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in.:::['7-13-36']
man, some stranger's gonna be living in my room.:::['7-13-37']
well, after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you......it's time the velvet ropes came down.:::['7-13-38']
they kept your room a while.:::['7-13-39']
oh, please. dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out.:::['7-13-40']
and i gotta say, a tanning bed and a stack of victoria's secret catalogs?:::['7-13-41']
not a gym.:::['7-13-42']
come on. you know they love you. as much as they love you?:::['7-13-43']
i was their firstborn. they thought she was barren. it's not my fault.:::['7-13-44']
ugh. i hate this year.:::['7-13-45']
what's wrong with this year?:::['7-13-46']
it's already february and i've only given two massages......and they were both:::['7-13-47']
the worst tippers in the world.:::['7-13-48']
that was me and ross.:::['7-13-49']
if you want to pick up some extra cash......some friends of mine made good money:::['7-13-51']
in college doing telemarketing.:::['7-13-52']
yeah, it'd probably be better than the last telephone job i had.:::['7-13-53']
you know, i probably won't have to say "spank" as much.:::['7-13-54']
oh, yeah, like you never called.:::['7-13-56']
so, basically, this is very easy. you read from the script......and try to sell as much toner:::['7-13-57']
as you possibly can.:::['7-13-58']
okay, i can do that.:::['7-13-59']
oh, by the way, i love my office. ha, ha.:::['7-13-60']
why don't we do a trial run? oh, okay.:::['7-13-61']
um, all right.:::['7-13-62']
hi, this is phoebe from empire office supplies.:::['7-13-63']
can i speak to your supply manager, please? i'm the supply manager.:::['7-13-64']
um, okay. i'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.:::['7-13-65']
we don't need any toner. well, i'm sorry to bother you. bye-bye.:::['7-13-66']
yeah, you're right. this is easy.:::['7-13-67']
okay. what was wrong with that call?:::['7-13-68']
oh, well, all right.:::['7-13-69']
um, no offense, but you were kind of rude.:::['7-13-70']
they're always gonna tell you they don't need toner, but that's okay.:::['7-13-71']
because whatever they say... ...you can find the answer to it, here in the script.:::['7-13-72']
oh. so i think you're ready to sell toner.:::['7-13-73']
do you have any last questions? no.:::['7-13-74']
oh, wait, yes, i do. i do have one question::::['7-13-75']
what is toner?:::['7-13-76']
full bag?:::['7-13-79']
beer's still cold.:::['7-13-80']
something terrible must have happened here.:::['7-13-81']
stevie, i was never here.:::['7-13-83']
ross: dad? jack: i'm here.:::['7-13-84']
god, it seems like just yesterday you guys used to come out to watch me work.:::['7-13-86']
dad, we can't believe you're selling the house.:::['7-13-87']
it's time for a new family to start their memories here.:::['7-13-88']
and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack......in the foundation:::['7-13-89']
and the asbestos in the ceiling.:::['7-13-90']
let's just grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.:::['7-13-91']
i'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.:::['7-13-92']
oh, it's okay. i can't wait to see everything again. all the memories.:::['7-13-93']
i don't know what's in the boxes down here.:::['7-13-94']
but i do know that there are six or seven easy-bake ovens in the attic.:::['7-13-95']
i used to love to play restaurant.:::['7-13-96']
yeah, not as much as you loved to play "uncooked batter eater.":::['7-13-97']
hey. it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a light bulb to cook brownies.:::['7-13-98']
so i think your boxes are over here.:::['7-13-99']
ross: oh, great.:::['7-13-100']
hey......dad, whose cigarettes are these?:::['7-13-101']
they must be your mother's.:::['7-13-103']
but please, please don't ask her. i'll throw these away.:::['7-13-104']
cool. dad, my report cards.:::['7-13-105']
hey, check this out. dad.:::['7-13-106']
math, a. science, a. history, a. gym...:::['7-13-107']
ooh, my rock polisher.:::['7-13-108']
uh-oh. what?:::['7-13-109']
you know how the garage floods every spring?:::['7-13-110']
how are you ever gonna sell this place?:::['7-13-111']
i think i accidentally used monica's boxes......to keep the water away:::['7-13-112']
from the porsche.:::['7-13-113']
oh, no, dad. dad?:::['7-13-114']
what the...?:::['7-13-115']
oh, god. everything's ruined.:::['7-13-116']
dad, she's gonna be crushed.:::['7-13-117']
you don't secretly smoke, do you?:::['7-13-118']
so it's just your mother, then.:::['7-13-120']
hi. this is phoebe from empire office supplies.:::['7-13-121']
can i speak to your supply manager, please?:::['7-13-122']
earl. thanks.:::['7-13-123']
hi, earl. this is phoebe from empire office supplies.:::['7-13-124']
i'd like to talk to you about your toner needs.:::['7-13-125']
i don't need any toner.:::['7-13-126']
i'm hearing what you're saying, but at our prices, everyone needs toner.:::['7-13-127']
not me.:::['7-13-128', '3-7-254']
may i ask why?:::['7-13-129']
you want to know why?:::['7-13-130']
i surely do.:::['7-13-131']
i don't need any toner......because i'm gonna kill myself.:::['7-13-133']
is that because you're out of toner?:::['7-13-135']
okay, so no toner today. thanks anyway. bye-bye.:::['7-13-136']
no, no, wait, wait. i can't just let you hang up. just please talk to me.:::['7-13-137']
i only had one thing to do today.:::['7-13-139']
i guess i could push it back.:::['7-13-140']
yeah. now, why do you want to kill yourself?:::['7-13-141']
i've been working for 10 years now at this......meaningless, dead-end job......and nobody here:::['7-13-142']
even knows that i exist.:::['7-13-143']
oh. look......i'm sure that people know you exist.:::['7-13-146']
oh, yeah? i work in a cubicle surrounded by people.:::['7-13-147']
i've been talking to you for five minutes now about killing myself......and no one's even looked up:::['7-13-148']
from their desk. hang on.:::['7-13-149']
hey, everybody, uh......i'm gonna kill myself.:::['7-13-150']
i got nothing.:::['7-13-151', '10-2-178']
good chair.:::['7-13-152']
now, if anybody asks......your name is rosita.:::['7-13-153']
poor thing. cut down in her prime.:::['7-13-155']
joey, the new chair will be here in an hour.:::['7-13-156']
maybe we should actually move rosita out of here, you know?:::['7-13-157']
start the healing process.:::['7-13-158']
yeah, i guess you're right. okay.:::['7-13-159']
she's healed.:::['7-13-160']
that's weird. no, it's not weird.:::['7-13-161']
it's a miracle.:::['7-13-162']
it's not a miracle, joey. i'm sure there's an explanation.:::['7-13-163']
there is. if you want something enough and your heart is pure... ...wondrous things can happen.:::['7-13-164']
well, she'll understand, right? it's not like i did it on purpose.:::['7-13-165']
dad, that won't matter to her.:::['7-13-166']
look, all my stuff is safe and dry. and all her stuff is......growing new stuff.:::['7-13-167']
see, this is exactly the kind of thing......that makes her think:::['7-13-168']
you guys love me more than you love her.:::['7-13-169']
oh, my god. does she really think that?:::['7-13-170']
well, can you blame her?:::['7-13-171']
i don't know. i suppose we may have favored you unconsciously. you were a medical marvel.:::['7-13-172']
the doctors said your mom couldn't... i don't want to hear about it.:::['7-13-173']
really? well, not right now.:::['7-13-174']
okay, look. monica came here for some memories. damn it, we're gonna give her some.:::['7-13-175']
okay, grab...:::['7-13-176']
grab some empty boxes, okay? we'll take stuff from mine......and whatever we can pass off:::['7-13-177']
as hers, we'll put them in there.:::['7-13-178']
right. like, this. she could have made this.:::['7-13-179']
this could have been hers. sure.:::['7-13-180']
you know, if you want to tell the medical marvel story while we work... ...that'd be fine.:::['7-13-181']
i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself.:::['7-13-182']
wow, you know, that this thing has speakers in the headrest?:::['7-13-184']
no, really? yeah.:::['7-13-186']
you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio.:::['7-13-187']
my chair heals itself.:::['7-13-188']
all right. earl, let's just forget about the people at the office, okay?:::['7-13-189']
there's gotta be someone else in your life that's worth sticking around for.:::['7-13-190']
what about your family or friends? or maybe a girlfriend?:::['7-13-191']
heh. yeah, right.:::['7-13-192']
oh, sorry. boyfriend?:::['7-13-193']
okay, i should...:::['7-13-194']
i should probably be getting back to my thing now.:::['7-13-195']
see you. no.:::['7-13-196']
i'm not finished yet. don't you dare hang up on me!:::['7-13-197']
the new girl's good.:::['7-13-198']
so which boxes are mine?:::['7-13-199']
these are yours right here. okay.:::['7-13-200']
oh, a coloring book. yeah, yeah. oh, you loved that thing.:::['7-13-201']
you always had it with you. you never went anywhere without...:::['7-13-202']
without that coloring book.:::['7-13-203']
wow. looks like i had some trouble staying inside the lines.:::['7-13-205']
wow, look at this.:::['7-13-207']
i can't believe i even fit into this shirt.:::['7-13-208']
oh, this is yours.:::['7-13-209']
i don't know how that got in there.:::['7-13-210']
hey, this isn't my stuff.:::['7-13-211']
ross, these are your boxes.:::['7-13-212']
where are my boxes?:::['7-13-213']
the garage flooded, sweetie, and it ruined everything in your boxes. i'm sorry.:::['7-13-214']
just mine? i'm afraid so.:::['7-13-215']
so why wasn't ross' stuff ruined?:::['7-13-216']
i used your boxes to divert water away from the porsche.:::['7-13-217']
so wait. ross' stuff is fine, but i have no memories......because you wanted to keep the:::['7-13-218']
bottom two inches of your car from water?:::['7-13-219']
well, there was also leaves and gook and stuff.:::['7-13-220']
screw it. i'm having one.:::['7-13-222']
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines......has a rolling massage......and speakers in the headrest?:::['7-13-224']
yeah, i'd love to, but i've tried that so many times......they won't even let me:::['7-13-225']
in the store anymore.:::['7-13-226']
well, what if i told you that you could do it in my apartment?:::['7-13-227']
are you telling me......that you bought the chair that is making:::['7-13-228']
all other lounge systems obsolete?:::['7-13-229']
the chair that sit magazine called "chair of the year"?:::['7-13-230']
i just purchased......the la-z-boy e-cliner 3000.:::['7-13-231']
well, that's awesome. that's great. what made you do it?:::['7-13-232']
well, it's a long story, but i broke joey's chair...:::['7-13-233']
whoa, whoa, whoa. you broke joey's chair?:::['7-13-234']
yeah. i thought i broke joey's chair. that's why i replaced it with mine. oh.:::['7-13-235']
that's how it got fixed.:::['7-13-236']
well, what did you think? that elves came in and fixed it?:::['7-13-237']
angels.:::['7-13-239']
i'm getting my chair back. hey.:::['7-13-240']
well, looks like it wasn't healed after all.:::['7-13-241']
so i guess this chair's mine now.:::['7-13-242']
joey, you broke my chair!:::['7-13-243']
your chair?:::['7-13-244']
yeah, he thought he broke your chair, so he switched the chairs.:::['7-13-245']
so there was no miracle? no, joe. no miracle.:::['7-13-246']
oh, no. this is devastating.:::['7-13-247']
my faith is shaken. i'm so glad i have the new chair to get me through this difficult time in my life.:::['7-13-248']
excuse me, could you tell me where can i find earl? he's the supply manager here.:::['7-13-249']
sorry, i don't know any earl.:::['7-13-250']
i'm right here!:::['7-13-251']
earl?:::['7-13-252']
i'm phoebe. phoebe?:::['7-13-253']
the lady who sells toner?:::['7-13-254']
um, look, you can't kill yourself.:::['7-13-255']
look, um, i really appreciate you coming down...:::['7-13-256']
no, no, i can't let you do it.:::['7-13-257']
why? because it was fate that made me call you today.:::['7-13-258']
i thought it was toner.:::['7-13-259']
no. think about it, okay? this isn't even my regular job, okay?:::['7-13-260']
and my first day on the job, you're my first call.:::['7-13-261']
and somebody else might have hung up on you, but i wouldn't do that......because i know about this stuff.:::['7-13-262']
my mom killed herself. really?:::['7-13-263']
phoebe: yes. how?:::['7-13-264']
i'm not gonna give you tips.:::['7-13-265']
look, don't you see that this...?:::['7-13-266']
this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this.:::['7-13-267']
couldn't it just be a coincidence? no, it's fate.:::['7-13-268']
it doesn't really seem like enough to be fate.:::['7-13-269']
oh, well. um, okay, here's a weird thing.:::['7-13-270']
my mother was also a supply manager.:::['7-13-271']
i'm actually the office manager.:::['7-13-272']
oh, my god. so was she!:::['7-13-273']
and get this, okay.:::['7-13-274']
your name is earl, right? her name was pearl.:::['7-13-275']
pearl.:::['7-13-276']
was there anything else?:::['7-13-277']
um, where are you from?:::['7-13-279']
philadelphia. oh, my god, so was she!:::['7-13-280']
oh, i've got goose bumps.:::['7-13-281']
really? well, i'm wearing layers, and it's warm. yeah.:::['7-13-282']
but... look. okay. these jerks might not care about you......but the universe does,and that says a lot.:::['7-13-283']
i don't need you guys to care about me......because the universe cares.:::['7-13-285']
the whole universe!:::['7-13-286']
i really wish they'd care just a little bit.:::['7-13-287']
oh, this is terrible.:::['7-13-288', '7-10-274']
everything is destroyed.:::['7-13-289']
it obviously meant enough for me to save it, and now i can't tell what it is.:::['7-13-291']
it's still soft.:::['7-13-292']
what do you think this is?:::['7-13-293']
mon, i think it was a mouse.:::['7-13-294']
how are you, honey? monica: how do you think i am?:::['7-13-295']
you've wrecked all my childhood memories......you love ross more than me.:::['7-13-296']
and i just rubbed a dead mouse on my face.:::['7-13-297']
sweetheart, we love you just as much as ross.:::['7-13-298']
now, i'm sorry about everything that happened......and i'll probably never be able:::['7-13-299']
to make it up to you......but here's a start.:::['7-13-300']
what's this? it's the key to my porsche.:::['7-13-301']
well, the key to your porsche.:::['7-13-302']
i've been thinking of getting rid of it... ...and i was driving it the other day and i saw my reflection in a window.:::['7-13-304']
your mother's right, i do look like an ass.:::['7-13-305']
you're giving it to me? you're kidding me, right?:::['7-13-306']
well, wait a minute.:::['7-13-307']
i mean, a couple of stupid boxes get wet, and she gets a porsche?:::['7-13-308']
why don't we take it for a spin? all right.:::['7-13-309']
what about me? i'm a medical marvel!:::['7-13-310']
oh, yeah. oh.:::['7-13-311']
know what happened to chandler's barcalounger?:::['7-13-313']
oh, yeah. joey broke it. had to get rid of it.:::['7-13-314']
are you kidding? i get a porsche and the barcalounger's gone?:::['7-13-315']
heh. this is the best day ever!:::['7-13-316']
ross, when's this comet thing start?:::['7-12-0']
well, technically, it started 7 billion years ago.:::['7-12-1']
rachel: no, no. joey: oh, god.:::['7-12-2']
okay. fine, i'll stop. no teaching, okay?:::['7-12-3']
we'll just watch the pretty light streaking across the sky.:::['7-12-4']
okay? chandler: okay.:::['7-12-5']
whose official name is bapstein-king. okay! okay!:::['7-12-6']
there it is. oh, look at that!:::['7-12-7']
isn't mother nature amazing?:::['7-12-8']
that's a plane.:::['7-12-9']
well, all right, 1700 bags of peanuts flying that high......that's pretty amazing too.:::['7-12-10']
i wonder if you can see my apartment. no, you can't.:::['7-12-11']
what? i don't know.:::['7-12-12', '3-25-197']
man, look at all those stars.:::['7-12-13']
infinite space. it really makes you wonder, doesn't it?:::['7-12-14']
know what else makes you wonder? huh?:::['7-12-15']
check out the rack on that chick.:::['7-12-16']
we've been out here for two hours......and we haven't seen any:::['7-12-17']
stupid comets. can we go now?:::['7-12-18']
i mean, chandler's getting chilly.:::['7-12-19']
then why are you wearing monica's jacket?:::['7-12-21']
because it's flattering!:::['7-12-22']
come on, monica. come on, monica.:::['7-12-23']
we're taking off too. we rented a movie. oh, i won't say no to a movie.:::['7-12-24']
oh, pheebs, we just actually wanted to be alone.:::['7-12-25']
shh. get me out of here. rachel: oh, okay.:::['7-12-26']
hey, ross. what?:::['7-12-27']
check this out. is it the comet?:::['7-12-28']
no. look, there's a bug stuck in tar right here.:::['7-12-29']
i bring you to see the bapstein-king comet......one of nature's:::['7-12-31']
most spectacular phenomena......and all you care about are bugs:::['7-12-32']
stuck in tar and some woman.:::['7-12-33']
you know, there's two women, dude.:::['7-12-34']
show me where.:::['7-12-35']
right... right up here.:::['7-12-36']
joey, where's the pipe that was holding the door open?:::['7-12-37']
joey! what? hey, don't look at me!:::['7-12-40']
you wanted to come up here and look for some stupid burger king comet.:::['7-12-41']
it's called the bapstein-king comet, okay?:::['7-12-42']
hey, bapstein was a very well-respected astronomer from...:::['7-12-43']
monica. she's sleeping.:::['7-12-46']
i know. just a quick question.:::['7-12-47']
which one was deep impact and which one was armageddon?:::['7-12-48']
deep impact was the one with robert duvall.:::['7-12-49']
armageddon is what's going to happen to you if you wake me up.:::['7-12-50']
sorry, i just can't sleep.:::['7-12-51']
where's that book you're reading with two women who are ice-skating......and wearing those hats:::['7-12-53']
with the flowers on it.:::['7-12-54']
because every time i look at that cover, i'm like::::['7-12-55']
it's in the living room, where there's also a light......and no one will:::['7-12-56']
kick you in the shin.:::['7-12-57']
please don't be a spaceship. please don't be a spaceship.:::['7-12-60']
hm.:::['7-12-62', '10-17-489']
how could you be beeping? i just disconnected you!:::['7-12-63']
i took out your battery! how can...?:::['7-12-64']
don't interrupt me!:::['7-12-65']
ross: monica! monica!:::['7-12-66']
all right, well, i guess we know what we have to do to get down.:::['7-12-69']
yeah, i guess we don't have a choice.:::['7-12-70']
help us! please, help us!:::['7-12-71']
we're stuck up on the roof, and we can't get down!:::['7-12-72']
i was thinking we'd just go down the fire escape.:::['7-12-74']
i know. i wasn't finished.:::['7-12-75']
but don't worry!:::['7-12-76']
we're gonna go down the fire escape!:::['7-12-77']
shh-shh-shh!:::['7-12-78']
i'm sorry, i thought i'd make some warm milk and it would help me sleep.:::['7-12-79']
with a wok?:::['7-12-80']
i thought my boring book was gonna put you to sleep.:::['7-12-81']
it got interesting.:::['7-12-82']
damn you, oprah!:::['7-12-83']
here, let me make the milk. i'm up anyway.:::['7-12-84']
you know what we could do now that we're up?:::['7-12-85']
we could just talk to each other all night long.:::['7-12-86']
like when we were first going out. it'd be fun.:::['7-12-87']
okay, that does sound fun. yeah.:::['7-12-88']
so how bummed were you when the second sister died, huh?:::['7-12-89']
the second sister dies?!:::['7-12-90']
no, i was talking about the book i was reading.:::['7-12-92']
the second sister dies in archie and jughead double digest?:::['7-12-93']
want to go in the bedroom? it's more comfortable.:::['7-12-95']
oh, wait, did you send those contracts to milan?:::['7-12-97']
if this is your idea of sexy talk... no.:::['7-12-98']
seriously. did you overnight the contracts i gave you?:::['7-12-99']
what contracts?:::['7-12-100']
please tell me this is just one of your jokes that i don't get. heh, heh.:::['7-12-101']
like what?:::['7-12-102', '10-14-219', '5-4-310']
like the thing when you put the phone in your pants?:::['7-12-103']
tag, i'm serious. this isn't funny.:::['7-12-104']
those contracts had to go out today.:::['7-12-105']
you didn't give me any contracts.:::['7-12-106']
yes, i did. i put a little post-it on it that said::::['7-12-107']
"must go out today," and i underlined "today" three times.:::['7-12-108']
then i put a little heart in the corner because i didn't wanna seem too bossy.:::['7-12-109']
you never gave them to me.:::['7-12-110']
if we went to the office, you would see those contracts sitting on your desk.:::['7-12-111']
no, i'd see you looking embarrassed because they are not on my desk.:::['7-12-112']
maybe i'm embarrassed because you talk on the phone with your crotch.:::['7-12-113']
you want to go to the office now? no.:::['7-12-114']
come on, it's late. we're not going down to the office.:::['7-12-115']
yeah, i understand. i wouldn't want to be proved wrong either.:::['7-12-116']
all right, get your coat!:::['7-12-117']
oh! when did you unhook this? nice work!:::['7-12-118']
it won't go down any further. it's stuck.:::['7-12-119']
we'll just have to jump.:::['7-12-120']
yep. now, we're gonna have to make sure to land......to the right of that:::['7-12-121']
patch of ice, okay?:::['7-12-122']
not hit the dumpster on the other side.:::['7-12-123']
and try to avoid that weird brownish-red stuff in the middle.:::['7-12-124']
so when you get down there......you go up to the roof:::['7-12-125']
and you let me in.:::['7-12-126']
whoa. wait a minute. i have to do it? yeah. you'll be fine.:::['7-12-127']
it'll be just like bungee jumping, you know?:::['7-12-128']
but instead of bouncing back up, you won't.:::['7-12-129']
well, what if i smack my head on the concrete?:::['7-12-130']
well, i'm not gonna lie to you, joey. it's a possibility.:::['7-12-131']
i don't know. tell you what, let's flip to see who does it.:::['7-12-132']
you call it in the air, all right? oh, all right. tail. oh!:::['7-12-133']
can you see what it is? no.:::['7-12-134']
okay. well, you be careful. no. no, ross, stop.:::['7-12-135']
i'm not jumping.:::['7-12-136']
look, i have an audition tomorrow, and i can't go if i break my leg.:::['7-12-137']
well, i'm not jumping. i have a son. he won't have a father if i die.:::['7-12-138']
so it looks like we're even.:::['7-12-139']
okay, so this wire......is connected to this wire,which plugs into here.:::['7-12-140']
okay, so to get the beeping to stop, all i have to do...:::['7-12-141']
well done, pheebs.:::['7-12-143']
what do you want from me?!:::['7-12-144']
here's your milk. what should we talk about?:::['7-12-145']
oh, were you sleeping, sweetie? i'm sorry. here.:::['7-12-147']
okay. feel free to look......but i'm telling you:::['7-12-148']
those contracts are not on this desk.:::['7-12-149']
how could you know? look at this mess, tag.:::['7-12-150']
this is what i'm talking about. you have to be more organized.:::['7-12-151']
you've got newspapers, you've got magazines, you... oh!:::['7-12-152']
and who's this chippy?:::['7-12-153']
a little young for you, but whatever.:::['7-12-154']
really? very cute braces.:::['7-12-156']
anyway, you know what? the point is, tag, start looking......because you're gonna find:::['7-12-157']
those contracts on your desk.:::['7-12-158']
so when do you imagine you gave them to me? morning or afternoon?:::['7-12-159']
in the afternoon. mr. zelner came into my office after lunch......he put them on my desk,and then i put a post-it on it......that said::::['7-12-160']
"must go out today.":::['7-12-161']
so you just keep looking in there, all right?:::['7-12-162']
not here.:::['7-12-163']
puzzler.:::['7-12-164']
bit of a puzzle.:::['7-12-165']
why don't you check the copy room? maybe the contracts are in there.:::['7-12-166']
how could i have left them in the copy room? i don't know.:::['7-12-167']
how can your genitals make phone calls?:::['7-12-168']
okay? it's not a perfect world. just go, please?:::['7-12-169']
i still don't get it.:::['7-12-172']
you still awake?:::['7-12-173']
yeah. you?:::['7-12-174']
you do know that was me that just said that, right?:::['7-12-175']
as long as we're both up...:::['7-12-177']
i hope you're not thinking about cleaning the living room.:::['7-12-179']
man, i'm starving. what the hell was i thinking at dinner?:::['7-12-180']
"do you want soup or salad?" both, always order both.:::['7-12-181']
you know, i'm looking, and i don't think anyone's home here.:::['7-12-182']
i say we just break the window......crawl through......and you know, explain later.:::['7-12-183']
no one's home? i don't think so.:::['7-12-184']
so when you get in there...:::['7-12-186']
okay. this is where you and i part ways.:::['7-12-187']
noisy bitch!:::['7-12-188']
oh, what? what are you doing?:::['7-12-189']
do you know what just happened?:::['7-12-190']
yeah. we had sex and then we fell asleep.:::['7-12-191']
no. we were in the middle of sex......and you fell asleep.:::['7-12-192']
no. no, that's not true.:::['7-12-193']
no, best time ever.:::['7-12-194']
yeah. you rock my world.:::['7-12-195']
monica? what?:::['7-12-196']
i was giving you some of my best moves, and you missed it.:::['7-12-197']
so please wake up so we can do it right.:::['7-12-198']
okay. okay. i'm ready.:::['7-12-199']
come on, big fella. okay.:::['7-12-200']
give me the good stuff. yeah.:::['7-12-201']
no, no, no. don't fall asleep.:::['7-12-202']
okay, i'm going to make you some coffee.:::['7-12-203']
well, i probably won't spill coffee grounds all over the kitchen floor.:::['7-12-204']
okay, i'm up. i'm up.:::['7-12-205']
hi. i got you some coffee to...:::['7-12-206']
so you got anything for me?:::['7-12-207']
still no luck. oh, my god.:::['7-12-208']
you checked your entire desk and all the drawers?:::['7-12-209']
want me to check again? i wish you would.:::['7-12-210']
well, no, it's not in there.:::['7-12-211']
how about that drawer?:::['7-12-212']
well, it's not out here. any chance it could be in your office?:::['7-12-213']
i mean, let me check.:::['7-12-215']
any luck?:::['7-12-216', '4-6-191']
can i see you in my office for a minute?:::['7-12-217']
you found them!:::['7-12-219']
i'm not even gonna gloat.:::['7-12-220']
i'm just really relieved it's... you put these on my desk.:::['7-12-221']
i did not. oh, really?:::['7-12-222']
so they slid out of your bottom drawer......crawled across the floor,then jumped onto my desk?:::['7-12-223']
how did you know they were in my bottom drawer?:::['7-12-224']
i am so hot for you right now.:::['7-12-225']
oh, my god! how did you get back here?:::['7-12-226']
man: phoebe buffay?:::['7-12-227']
fire alarm?:::['7-12-228']
oh, hi, officer fireman. can i help you?:::['7-12-229']
your fire alarm was in the trash.:::['7-12-230']
that's not mine. yes, it is.:::['7-12-231']
how do you know?:::['7-12-232', '10-13-260', '3-24-15']
if you dump a fire alarm, don't use a blanket that says::::['7-12-233']
"property of phoebe buffay, not monica.":::['7-12-234']
do you have a search warrant?:::['7-12-235']
because the last time i checked, this was still america.:::['7-12-236']
please reattach it. it's against the law to disconnect them.:::['7-12-237']
fine. but please, god, tell me how to stop it from going off?:::['7-12-238']
press the reset button.:::['7-12-239']
there's a reset button? oh, thank you. thank you.:::['7-12-240']
oh. there's a reset button?:::['7-12-241']
why didn't i see that?:::['7-12-243']
reset button. reset button.:::['7-12-244']
where is there a reset button? oh, here it is! oh!:::['7-12-245']
okay, you have a good grip? yeah.:::['7-12-247']
okay, i'm gonna start to climb down you now.:::['7-12-248']
all right, just hurry up. okay.:::['7-12-249']
now, should i climb down your front so we're face to face......or should i climb down:::['7-12-250']
your back so we're......butt to face?:::['7-12-251']
face to face. i like face to face.:::['7-12-252']
okay, here i come. all right.:::['7-12-253']
oh, my... how much do you weigh, ross?:::['7-12-254']
i prefer not to answer that right now. i'm still carrying a little holiday weight.:::['7-12-255']
when we talked about face to face......i don't think we thought it:::['7-12-256']
what do you want me to do? just shimmy down me and drop.:::['7-12-258']
you know, maybe i should hang, and you should climb down me.:::['7-12-260']
yeah? maybe we should talk about that for a little while!:::['7-12-261']
it still looks pretty far. it's not that far. just drop.:::['7-12-262']
do not rush me!:::['7-12-263']
ross, my pants are starting to come down, and i'm not wearing any underwear.:::['7-12-264']
ross: whoa!:::['7-12-265']
ow! my ankle! i really hurt my ankle!:::['7-12-266']
i think i twisted it when... ooh, a quarter!:::['7-12-267']
that really was some of your best work.:::['7-12-268']
i told you.:::['7-12-269']
i've only got two hours until i call in sick for work.:::['7-12-271']
i have to be up in seven minutes.:::['7-12-272']
well, you're not gonna believe this, but if you have seven minutes...:::['7-12-273']
you want to?:::['7-12-275']
okay. you get the vacuum cleaner. i'll get the furniture polish.:::['7-12-276']
i just got reservations at michelle's......and tickets to the music man:::['7-10-1']
to celebrate......our first holiday:::['7-10-2']
as a betrothed couple.:::['7-10-3']
"betrothed." betrothed couple.:::['7-10-4']
hey. chandler: hi.:::['7-10-5']
pheebs? phoebe: uh-huh?:::['7-10-7']
skull?:::['7-10-8']
oh. yeah, it's my mom's.:::['7-10-9']
no, no, no. it's not my mom.:::['7-10-11']
it belonged to my mom.:::['7-10-12']
she used to put it out every christmas......to remind us that even though:::['7-10-13']
it's christmas, people still die.:::['7-10-14']
and you can put candy in it.:::['7-10-15']
licorice?:::['7-10-17']
sure. ha, ha.:::['7-10-18', '3-14-272']
i get ben for the holidays this year. that's great!:::['7-10-19']
are you gonna dress up as santa? nope.:::['7-10-20']
i know susan does every year.:::['7-10-21']
i want to take this year to teach him about hanukkah.:::['7-10-22']
and maybe i could teach ben......about the christmas skull:::['7-10-23']
and how people die.:::['7-10-24']
you may need to use this year to teach ben about phoebe.:::['7-10-25']
did you know he was in there? no.:::['7-10-28']
how long have we been home? about half an hour.:::['7-10-29']
lovely.:::['7-10-30']
you know what i was thinking? when we get married, will you, uh......change your name to "bing"?:::['7-10-31']
bing's weird.:::['7-10-34']
oh, hey, you guys.:::['7-10-35']
monica & chandler & phoebe: hey.:::['7-10-36']
guess what? my landlord just called. my apartment's gonna be ready soon.:::['7-10-37']
i guess i'll be moving out.:::['7-10-38']
aw, phoebe, i'm gonna miss you.:::['7-10-39']
yes, you will be very sad.:::['7-10-40']
i gotta go tell rachel the good news. oh. you'll be living together again?:::['7-10-41']
why not? she's having so much fun with joey......i assumed she'd still:::['7-10-42']
be living with him.:::['7-10-43']
why do you think she's having so much fun?:::['7-10-44']
no reason, except she......told me.:::['7-10-45']
she said she didn't want to live with me?:::['7-10-46']
no. no, she didn't say that.:::['7-10-47']
i think you should talk to monica now.:::['7-10-48']
phoebe, i'm sure she wants to live with you.:::['7-10-49']
you're absolutely sure?:::['7-10-50']
no, but i'll bet she probably does.:::['7-10-51']
oh, probably?:::['7-10-52']
i don't like that word.:::['7-10-53']
i know what "probably" really means. yeah, uh-huh, yeah.:::['7-10-54']
"oh, your mom probably won't kill herself.":::['7-10-55']
you know. i'm sorry, but i'm not hanging my hopes......of rachel and i living together:::['7-10-56']
on "probably.":::['7-10-57']
you gotta take care of yourself in this world.:::['7-10-58']
history teaches us nothing.:::['7-10-59']
bing doesn't seem so weird now, does it?:::['7-10-60']
you're home.:::['7-10-61']
guess what phoebe got me for christmas?:::['7-10-62']
drums? no, drums!:::['7-10-63']
could we get two burritos to go, please? ha, ha.:::['7-10-64']
i'm sorry. but not that sorry, you don't have to live with it.:::['7-10-65']
um, we have a reservation under bing.:::['7-10-66']
okay, we'll have a table for you in about 45 minutes.:::['7-10-67']
we have tickets to the music man at 8.:::['7-10-68']
i'm sorry. christmas is a very busy time, sir.:::['7-10-69']
is this because of the burrito thing?:::['7-10-70']
you need to give him money. it was a joke!:::['7-10-71']
to get a table. places like this are always shaking you down.:::['7-10-72']
everybody wants a payoff. all right, calm down, o'malley.:::['7-10-73']
i'll slip him some money. but you've got to be smooth.:::['7-10-74']
hey, i can be smooth.:::['7-10-75']
we're in a hurry. if you could get us a table......a bit quicker, i'd appreciate it.:::['7-10-76']
of course, sir. okay.:::['7-10-77']
how'd it go? had the money in the wrong hand.:::['7-10-78']
you don't feel......like you're gonna throw up?:::['7-10-79']
well, i do. so let's...:::['7-10-81']
so, ben, you, uh...:::['7-10-82']
you know what holiday is coming up?:::['7-10-83']
christmas.:::['7-10-84']
yeah, and you know what other holiday is coming up?:::['7-10-85']
christmas eve.:::['7-10-86']
yes, but also...:::['7-10-87']
hanukkah!:::['7-10-88']
see, you're part jewish and hanukkah is a jewish holiday.:::['7-10-89']
santa has reindeers that can fly.:::['7-10-90']
right, um, but on hanukkah...:::['7-10-91']
hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle.:::['7-10-92']
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees.:::['7-10-93']
jingle bells, jingle bells:::['7-10-94']
okay, that's right. yes......but on hanukkah, we sing, uh::::['7-10-95']
i made you out of clay:::['7-10-96']
rudolph the red-nosed reindeer:::['7-10-97']
ha, ha. okay, it's not a contest.:::['7-10-98']
when is santa coming?:::['7-10-99']
how about this year, instead of santa......we have fun celebrating hanukkah?:::['7-10-100']
no santa?:::['7-10-101']
was i bad?:::['7-10-102']
no, no, no, you weren't bad. you've been very good, ben.:::['7-10-103']
santa's mad at me. no, hey, hey, come on.:::['7-10-104']
ben, santa is not mad at you, okay?:::['7-10-105']
you're his favorite little guy.:::['7-10-106']
so santa's coming?:::['7-10-107']
santa's coming.:::['7-10-109']
it's easy. just keep it casual.:::['7-10-110']
shake his hand and give him the money.:::['7-10-111']
how do you know so much about this? i don't know.:::['7-10-112']
richard used to do it, didn't he?:::['7-10-113']
we'd be eating our soup right now.:::['7-10-114']
mustached bastard.:::['7-10-115']
those people just left. come on. quick, give him the money.:::['7-10-116']
we're in a bit of a hurry. can we please?:::['7-10-118']
ah-ha-ha-ha.:::['7-10-119']
so you like the drums.:::['7-10-121']
i was worried that they would create maybe......an unbearable living situation.:::['7-10-123']
but, okay, well, apparently not. so, yay!:::['7-10-124']
hey, we already learned a song.:::['7-10-125']
ready? one, two, three, four.:::['7-10-126']
tequila!:::['7-10-127']
that's fun.:::['7-10-128']
thank you, gunther. put her there.:::['7-10-130']
definitely not easier with coins.:::['7-10-131']
both: thank you.:::['7-10-132']
here. now i only owe you $49.50.:::['7-10-134']
if you want to get joey a gift that disrupts the entire building......why not something more subtle......like a wrecking ball......or a vial of smallpox:::['7-10-136']
to release in the hallway?:::['7-10-137']
it's not just the drum noise. every five minutes......joey throws his sticks:::['7-10-138']
in the air......and i have to hear::::['7-10-139']
"oh, my eye! oh, god, my eye!":::['7-10-140']
i mean, it's so annoying. yes, thank you.:::['7-10-141']
you see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.:::['7-10-142']
you got joey drums to annoy rachel......so she wouldn't want:::['7-10-143']
to live there anymore?:::['7-10-144']
maybe on some level.:::['7-10-145']
you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.:::['7-10-146']
what is rock 'n' roll about that?:::['7-10-147']
hey, joey, i got you another present.:::['7-10-148']
joey: hold it! before you tell me what it is...:::['7-10-149']
okay, what is it?:::['7-10-150']
it's a......tarantula!:::['7-10-151']
god, rachel, i'm sorry. what was i thinking......giving joey this big, gross,scary spider......in such a poorly constructed cage?:::['7-10-153']
what are you talking about? i love them.:::['7-10-154']
i had a tarantula when i was a kid. but it died because my cat ate it.:::['7-10-155']
and then my cat died.:::['7-10-156']
but, joey, isn't this cool?:::['7-10-157']
is it on me? i feel like it's on me. i got...:::['7-10-158']
oh, isn't that adorable?:::['7-10-159']
joey is afraid of the tarantula. phoebe: oh.:::['7-10-160']
he's so adorable.:::['7-10-161']
he's so much fun.:::['7-10-162']
i'm glad you're having so much fun here.:::['7-10-163']
whoa. wait a minute.:::['7-10-164']
our apartment is ready.:::['7-10-166']
and that makes you angry because?:::['7-10-167']
because you'd rather live here with joey.:::['7-10-168']
where did you get that? monica and chandler......said you were having:::['7-10-169']
so much fun here......and apparently no amount of drums:::['7-10-170']
or tarantulas is gonna change that.:::['7-10-171']
did you get all this stuff for joey......to try to drive me out:::['7-10-172']
of the apartment?:::['7-10-173']
you might as well have gotten him a fish.:::['7-10-174']
you know how fish freak me out.:::['7-10-175']
fish.:::['7-10-176']
but it wouldn't have mattered. we're gonna live together.:::['7-10-177']
that's the deal.:::['7-10-178']
yes, but i wanted you to want to live with me.:::['7-10-179']
but if you're having so much fun over here...:::['7-10-180']
oh. it's so much more fun with you.:::['7-10-181']
we did have fun, didn't we? we did.:::['7-10-182']
they say if we want, we could see it tonight.:::['7-10-183']
i would love to. yay, okay!:::['7-10-184']
good, good, good. great. all right. good.:::['7-10-185']
and monica asked me to make the drumming stop.:::['7-10-186']
um, ahem.:::['7-10-187']
hey. hello, sir. you here to return those pants?:::['7-10-189']
no, these are my pants.:::['7-10-190']
how can i help you? um, do you have a santa outfit left?:::['7-10-193']
two days before christmas? sorry, man.:::['7-10-194']
okay, look. do you have anything, uh, christmas-y?:::['7-10-195']
i promised my son, and i really don't want to disappoint him.:::['7-10-196']
um, come on, you gotta have something.:::['7-10-197']
i'm the holiday armadillo!:::['7-10-198']
i'm a friend of santa's......and he sent me here to wish you......a merry christmas!:::['7-10-199']
what happened to santa, holiday armadillo?:::['7-10-200']
santa was unavailable......so close to christmas.:::['7-10-201']
come in, have a seat.:::['7-10-202']
you must be exhausted, coming all the way from texas.:::['7-10-203']
texas? that's right, ben.:::['7-10-204']
i'm santa's representative......for all the southern states.:::['7-10-205']
and mexico!:::['7-10-206']
but santa sent me here......to give you these presents, ben.:::['7-10-207']
maybe the lady will help me with these presents.:::['7-10-208']
wow, thanks!:::['7-10-209']
ross: you're welcome, ben.:::['7-10-210']
merry christmas. ooh.:::['7-10-211']
and happy hanukkah!:::['7-10-212']
are you for hanukkah too? because i'm part jewish.:::['7-10-213']
you are? me too.:::['7-10-214']
because armadillos also wandered in the desert?:::['7-10-215']
you want to wander in the hall?:::['7-10-216']
oh. hey, ben!:::['7-10-217']
what if the holiday armadillo......told you all about:::['7-10-218']
the festival of lights?:::['7-10-219']
cool!:::['7-10-220', '3-6-311']
years and years ago......there were these people called......the maccabees!:::['7-10-222']
ho-ho-ho. merry christmas!:::['7-10-223']
ben: santa!:::['7-10-224']
well, i'm here to see my old buddy, ben.:::['7-10-227']
what are you doing here......weird turtle man?:::['7-10-228']
i'm the holiday armadillo......your part-jewish friend.:::['7-10-229']
did you bring me any presents, santa?:::['7-10-233']
you bet i did, ben.:::['7-10-234']
put her there.:::['7-10-235']
well, it would have worked this time if his hands weren't so damn small.:::['7-10-236']
ben, come open more presents.:::['7-10-238']
you said you were having trouble finding a santa costume......so i borrowed one:::['7-10-242']
about hanukkah......and you're wrecking it.:::['7-10-246']
but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowlful of jelly.:::['7-10-247']
fine, i'll give the suit back.:::['7-10-249']
santa, really?:::['7-10-251']
yeah, is that okay?:::['7-10-252']
did your dad ever dress up like santa?:::['7-10-253']
no. then it's okay!:::['7-10-254']
okay, ben. santa has to go.:::['7-10-255']
say goodbye.:::['7-10-256']
no, why does he have to go?:::['7-10-257']
because if santa and the holiday......armadillo......are ever in the same room:::['7-10-258']
for too long......the universe will implode!:::['7-10-259']
merry christmas!:::['7-10-260', '7-10-272', '3-10-296']
no, why can't the armadillo leave? i want santa.:::['7-10-261']
fine, i give up. santa...:::['7-10-262']
santa can stay!:::['7-10-263']
well, i'll stay......but only because i want to hear:::['7-10-264']
ben, will you sit here with santa......and learn about hanukkah?:::['7-10-266']
okay, santa.:::['7-10-267']
all right, it's time......for the story of hanukkah.:::['7-10-269']
years and years ago......there were these people:::['7-10-270']
called the maccabees!:::['7-10-271']
oh, wow, look at this place!:::['7-10-273']
they've made so many changes......i can't even feel:::['7-10-275']
my grandmother's presence anymore.:::['7-10-276']
oh, new sconces!:::['7-10-277']
remember, uh, how you told me your grandmother put up that wall......to make that into two bedrooms?:::['7-10-279']
and that the landlord might find out......and then tear it down?:::['7-10-281']
do you really not know where i'm going?:::['7-10-283']
it left. it's one huge room.:::['7-10-284']
i guess we'll have to put the wall back up.:::['7-10-288']
you can't because of the new skylight. there's a skylight?:::['7-10-289']
oh. so should we start looking for a new place?:::['7-10-291']
you know, i'm sensing......that, um, my grandmother:::['7-10-292']
would not be comfortable with that.:::['7-10-293']
starting to feel her again there, are we?:::['7-10-295']
a little bit. yeah. yeah.:::['7-10-296']
is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone?:::['7-10-297']
you heard it too? you have the gift.:::['7-10-298']
phoebe, it's okay.:::['7-10-299']
i like living with joey.:::['7-10-300']
are you sure? please. i hate packing......it's closer to work.:::['7-10-301']
and we do have fun.:::['7-10-302']
although, i'm really gonna miss living with you.:::['7-10-303']
oh, me too. i know.:::['7-10-304']
oh. did you hear that?:::['7-10-305']
i'm getting something from your grandmother.:::['7-10-306']
she said since you get to keep the one-bedroom apartment......you should give rachel:::['7-10-307']
the purple chair.:::['7-10-308']
no, i do not hear that.:::['7-10-309']
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil......that should have lasted:::['7-10-310']
just one day, burned for...:::['7-10-311']
eight whole days. ross: that's right.:::['7-10-312']
and that's why we celebrate hanukkah today. the end.:::['7-10-313']
awesome. yeah.:::['7-10-314']
my favorite part......was when superman:::['7-10-315']
flew all the jews out of egypt.:::['7-10-316']
the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part.:::['7-10-317']
okay, ben, it's time to light......the hanukkah candles!:::['7-10-318']
chandler: ho-ho-ho.:::['7-10-319']
looks like the easter bunny's funeral in here.:::['7-10-322']
come on, come on. we're lighting the candles.:::['7-10-323']
phoebe & rachel: oh, oh.:::['7-10-324']
i understand why superman is here......but why is there a porcupine:::['7-10-325']
at the easter bunny's funeral?:::['7-10-326']
joey: you get it? i got it.:::['7-10-327']
joey: back in the cage?:::['7-10-328']
it's back in the cage.:::['7-10-329']
joey: is the cage closed?:::['7-10-330']
joey, will you just come out here and stop being such a baby?:::['7-10-331']
oh. mm.:::['7-11-0']
hi. chandler: hey.:::['7-11-1', '5-5-196']
you have got to try this cheesecake.:::['7-11-2']
oh, you know, i'm not that much of a sweet tooth...:::['7-11-3']
oh, my god, it's so creamy. oh.:::['7-11-4']
oh, my god. that's the best cheesecake i've ever had.:::['7-11-5']
where did you get this?:::['7-11-6']
it was at the front door when i got home. somebody sent it to us.:::['7-11-7']
chandler, this isn't addressed to you.:::['7-11-8']
this is addressed to mrs. braverman downstairs.:::['7-11-9']
thief.:::['7-11-10']
i didn't read the box before i opened it......and you can't return a box:::['7-11-11']
after you opened it.:::['7-11-12']
why not? because it's too delicious.:::['7-11-13']
chandler, you stole this cheesecake. that is wrong.:::['7-11-14']
no, no, no, it is going to be okay... ...because mrs. braverman is gonna send away for a free one.:::['7-11-15']
and that way, we all win.:::['7-11-16']
the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate::::['7-11-17']
"mama's little bakery.":::['7-11-18']
i feel terrible.:::['7-11-19']
i'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.:::['7-11-20']
well, i'm sorry, what?:::['7-11-21']
i should get going. big day at work.:::['7-11-22']
you know how i'm in a coma?:::['7-11-23']
today they do a test on me and it turns out i'm not brain-dead.:::['7-11-24']
ah-ah, mr. smarty-pants.:::['7-11-26']
it's just my character that's not brain-dead.:::['7-11-27']
pheebs, still on for tonight?:::['7-11-28']
absolutely. okay. all right, i'll see you at 8.:::['7-11-29']
oh, what's at 8?:::['7-11-30']
oh, i have dinner plans with joey. we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys.:::['7-11-31']
wow. did not know that.:::['7-11-32']
may i say how lovely you look today?:::['7-11-33']
duly noted.:::['7-11-34']
oh, so for tomorrow... ...do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what?:::['7-11-35']
what are you talking about? cousin frannie's wedding. it's tomorrow night.:::['7-11-36']
you were invited?:::['7-11-37']
oh, my god, i can't believe this.:::['7-11-39']
i knew mom and dad were invited. i thought that was it.:::['7-11-40']
i mean, from the ages of 7 to 9, frannie and i were inseparable.:::['7-11-41']
well, maybe since the age of 9, frannie's made some new friends.:::['7-11-42']
look, it's probably just a mistake. let me call aunt cheryl, okay?:::['7-11-43']
maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail.:::['7-11-44']
yeah, well, you call her and tell her that, you know, when we were kids......her precious little frannie:::['7-11-45']
tried to undress me several times, okay?:::['7-11-46']
if i hadn't stopped her, there probably wouldn't be a wedding to go to.:::['7-11-47']
she tried to undress me too.:::['7-11-48']
i used to undress my cousin glenn.:::['7-11-49']
joseph francis tribbiani, are you home yet?:::['7-11-50']
um, i think he's still out. what's wrong?:::['7-11-51']
well, i'll tell you, rachel karen green.:::['7-11-52']
i had plans with joey tonight, and he left me this note.:::['7-11-53']
"pheebs, can't make it. got a date. talk to you later.:::['7-11-54']
big daddy.":::['7-11-55']
"big daddy"? oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.:::['7-11-56']
hey, you know what nickname never caught on? "the ross-a-tron.":::['7-11-57']
hey. oh, here's joseph francis.:::['7-11-58']
whoa, what are you middle-naming me for?:::['7-11-59']
i left you a note.:::['7-11-60']
so what? that doesn't give you the right to ditch me.:::['7-11-61']
hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there's a possibility for sex.:::['7-11-62']
phoebe, he's right. that is the rule.:::['7-11-63']
i don't accept this rule. when we make plans, i expect you to show up.:::['7-11-64']
okay, i can't just be a way to kill time till you meet someone better.:::['7-11-65']
you know, boyfriends and girlfriends are gonna come and go, but this is for life.:::['7-11-66']
wow. i'm so sorry. i had no idea it would bother you this much.:::['7-11-67']
well, it does.:::['7-11-68']
okay, can i make it up to you? huh?:::['7-11-69']
how about dinner tomorrow night? i'll pay for myself.:::['7-11-71']
okay, you wore me down.:::['7-11-72']
joe, while you're over there, how about another beer for "the ross-a-tron"?:::['7-11-73']
"ross..." is that back?:::['7-11-74']
hi. the other cheesecake came.:::['7-11-75']
they delivered it to the wrong address again.:::['7-11-76']
so just bring it back downstairs. what's the problem?:::['7-11-77']
i can't seem to say goodbye.:::['7-11-78']
are you serious? chandler, we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago......and you want more?:::['7-11-79']
well, i've forgotten what it tastes like, okay?:::['7-11-80']
it was cheesecake. it was fine.:::['7-11-81']
it had a buttery, crumbly, graham-cracker crust......with a very rich......yet light cream-cheese filling.:::['7-11-82']
wow, my whole mouth just filled with saliva. ahem.:::['7-11-83']
know what? forget it. we are just hungry.:::['7-11-84']
we have not had lunch. we are just lightheaded.:::['7-11-85']
so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.:::['7-11-86']
we'll drop it off downstairs so we're not tempted.:::['7-11-87']
where do you wanna go to lunch? mama's little bakery, chicago, illinois.:::['7-11-88']
mel tormé died.:::['7-11-90']
joey, that paper's like a year old.:::['7-11-91']
oh, does that mean the sam goody's sale is over?:::['7-11-92']
so i finally heard back from aunt cheryl......and apparently it wasn't a mistake.:::['7-11-94']
uh, there's limited seating in the hall...:::['7-11-95']
limited seating? i am just one tiny person.:::['7-11-96']
yeah, but she doesn't know that.:::['7-11-97']
i mean, the last time she saw you......you would've turned one of those:::['7-11-98']
little wedding chairs into kindling.:::['7-11-99']
"limited seating." that's such a lame excuse.:::['7-11-100']
that's not the reason why she's not inviting me.:::['7-11-101']
what's the big deal? i wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception.:::['7-11-102']
and you know what? if it makes you feel any better... ...joan and i will just make an appearance......and then we'll leave early:::['7-11-103']
as a sign of protest.:::['7-11-104']
joan? yeah, joan tedeschi, my date.:::['7-11-105']
she's an assistant professor in the linguistics department. tall, very beautiful.:::['7-11-106']
and despite what some people say, not broad-backed.:::['7-11-107']
wait a minute. you got "ross geller and guest"?:::['7-11-108']
i wasn't invited, and you got "and guest"?:::['7-11-109']
uh, excuse me, i do have to interrupt on ross' behalf.:::['7-11-110']
i think the rule applies here.:::['7-11-111']
since he has a chance to get on broad-back...:::['7-11-112']
not broad-back!:::['7-11-113']
wait a minute. you're bringing me.:::['7-11-114']
what? i can't cancel on joan.:::['7-11-115']
why not? did you not hear me?:::['7-11-116']
she's an assistant professor in the linguistics department, okay?:::['7-11-117']
they're wild.:::['7-11-118']
why do you want to come anyway? because......she's my cousin.:::['7-11-119']
i mean, we grew up together.:::['7-11-120']
family, you know? and all that's important to me.:::['7-11-121']
okay, all right. i'll take you.:::['7-11-122']
i'll go call joan.:::['7-11-123']
family should be there.:::['7-11-125']
this is her wedding. happiest day of her life.:::['7-11-126']
we'll see. ha, ha.:::['7-11-127']
well, thank you for lunch.:::['7-11-128']
wait a minute, i didn't pay. i thought you paid.:::['7-11-129']
so apparently, we just don't pay for food anymore.:::['7-11-130']
do you see what i see? huh! it's still there.:::['7-11-131']
mrs. braverman must be out.:::['7-11-132']
she could be out of town. maybe she'll be gone for months.:::['7-11-133']
by then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. we don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.:::['7-11-134']
that could kill her. wouldn't want that.:::['7-11-135']
no, we're protecting her.:::['7-11-136']
we should take it. but move quick.:::['7-11-137']
why? i heard her moving around in there.:::['7-11-138']
go, go, go.:::['7-11-139']
oh, my god, that's david.:::['7-11-140']
monica: who? phoebe: david, the scientist guy.:::['7-11-141']
david that i was in love with.:::['7-11-142']
david who went to russia and broke my heart, david.:::['7-11-143']
oh, you say someone's name enough, they turn around.:::['7-11-145']
phoebe. david.:::['7-11-146']
what are you doing here? aren't you supposed to be in russia?:::['7-11-147']
yeah, i'm just in town for a conference.:::['7-11-148']
um, god, you look phenomenal.:::['7-11-149']
well, ha, ha...:::['7-11-150']
you look great too. did you get a haircut?:::['7-11-152']
yeah. well, i got like 30 of them.:::['7-11-153']
um, look, i got a confession to make. uh-huh.:::['7-11-155']
um, i was hoping to run into you here.:::['7-11-156']
i didn't know that i should call or not. you know, i was only in town a few days......and, you know, i didn't want:::['7-11-157']
to intrude on your life or anything.:::['7-11-158']
but i really wanted to see you......but i didn't know:::['7-11-159']
if you wanted to see me.:::['7-11-160']
of course i would want to see you. i think about you all the time.:::['7-11-161']
really? because i think about you all the time.:::['7-11-162']
really? there's a statue in minsk... ...that reminds me of you so much.:::['7-11-163']
i mean, um, it's actually of lenin......but, you know, at certain angles...:::['7-11-164']
phoebe: yeah.:::['7-11-165', '10-16-97', '2-3-221', '2-6-304']
anyway, do you want to have dinner tonight?:::['7-11-166']
oh, no. oh.:::['7-11-168']
uh, what? i can't.:::['7-11-169']
i can't believe i have plans. i can't. can you do it tomorrow?:::['7-11-170']
uh, no, i have to go in a few hours. i have to be on the redeye.:::['7-11-171']
well, listen, you know, next time you're in minsk, uh...:::['7-11-172']
phoebe? can i talk to you for a second? uh-huh.:::['7-11-173']
well, i have plans with joey tonight. so? he'll understand.:::['7-11-175']
no, he won't. and that's not even the point.:::['7-11-176']
monica, i made a whole speech about how you do not cancel plans with friends.:::['7-11-177']
and now, you know, what? just because, potentially, the love of my life......comes back from russia just for:::['7-11-178']
one night, i should change my beliefs?:::['7-11-179']
i should change my beliefs.:::['7-11-180']
no. no, no. if i don't have my principles, i don't have anything.:::['7-11-181']
god, you are so strong.:::['7-11-182']
or i should rush through dinner with joey and i could meet david at 9.:::['7-11-183']
oh, my god, that is so good.:::['7-11-184']
i'm full. and yet i know if i stop eating this......i'll regret it.:::['7-11-185']
hey, what have you got there?:::['7-11-186']
oh, it's, um...:::['7-11-187']
it's tofu cake. do you want some? aah.:::['7-11-188']
what are you doing tonight? huh?:::['7-11-189']
uh. dude. dude.:::['7-11-190']
sorry. uh, i got those plans with phoebe. why?:::['7-11-191']
oh, really? uh, monica said she had a date at 9.:::['7-11-192']
what? tonight? that's what monica said.:::['7-11-193']
after she gave me that big speech... ...she goes and makes a date on the same night she has plans with me?:::['7-11-194']
i think she's trying to pull a fast one on big daddy.:::['7-11-195']
here, i think this is us. yeah.:::['7-11-196']
limited seating, my ass.:::['7-11-197']
let's just see who made the cut.:::['7-11-198']
hi. hi. i'm monica geller.:::['7-11-199']
how do you know the bride and groom? i worked with frannie.:::['7-11-200']
used to work with her. used to.:::['7-11-201']
i'm a relative and i didn't get invited, okay?:::['7-11-202']
a blood relative. blood.:::['7-11-203']
stop saying "blood" to strangers.:::['7-11-204']
so how about you? how do you know the happy couple?:::['7-11-205']
we went to college with both of them. and now we live next door.:::['7-11-206']
okay, you're fine.:::['7-11-207']
hey. are you guys ready? hey. yes.:::['7-11-208']
i will have a green salad, um, house dressing and water's fine.:::['7-11-209']
both: okay. and for you, sir?:::['7-11-210']
yeah. this slow-roasted salmon......just how slow are we talking?:::['7-11-211']
it's already been roasted.:::['7-11-212']
oh, then no. maybe i should hear those specials again.:::['7-11-213']
oh, joey, we've heard the specials three times, okay?:::['7-11-214']
there's prime rib, mahi-mahi and a very special lobster ravioli.:::['7-11-215']
actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli. oh, well, that changes everything.:::['7-11-216']
you know what, pheebs? uh-huh.:::['7-11-217']
you were right before. friends are so important.:::['7-11-218']
yeah, i'm very wise. i know.:::['7-11-219']
you know what i really want?:::['7-11-220']
phoebe: what? is to have a long, long talk.:::['7-11-221']
you know? get joey out on the open road and really open him up.:::['7-11-222']
any progress? yes.:::['7-11-223']
i will have the lobster ravioli.:::['7-11-224']
god, joey, this is taking forever.:::['7-11-225']
what's the rush? well......i just have, you know, an appointment.:::['7-11-226']
and it's very important.:::['7-11-227']
well......it's a date.:::['7-11-229']
a date? no, no, pheebs, you must be mistaken... ...because you wouldn't schedule a date......on the night you have plans:::['7-11-230']
with a friend.:::['7-11-231']
come on. don't make me feel badly about this.:::['7-11-232']
no, i'm gonna.:::['7-11-233']
that's right. yeah, you made me feel really guilty... ...about going out with that girl.:::['7-11-234']
like i did something terrible to you. now, pheebs, you're doing the same thing.:::['7-11-235']
that's not the same thing. this is totally different.:::['7-11-236']
this is with david. remember david, the scientist guy?:::['7-11-237']
okay, he's very special to me.:::['7-11-238']
okay, well, my girl from the other night was special. she was a scientist too.:::['7-11-239']
she was? well, she graduated high school.:::['7-11-240']
okay, whatever. know what? i don't have time to convince you.:::['7-11-241']
he's only here for four hours and i'm gonna go see him.:::['7-11-242']
fine. fine! phoebe: yeah. yeah.:::['7-11-243']
what are you still doing here? i told you, lobster ravioli.:::['7-11-244']
oh, i was just about to leave. i didn't think you were coming.:::['7-11-246']
oh, i wouldn't have missed this. ha, ha.:::['7-11-247']
well, i'm very glad you're here.:::['7-11-248']
oh, you're such a gentleman.:::['7-11-249']
come on, we're going to my place.:::['7-11-250']
are you eating the cheesecake without me?:::['7-11-251']
mm-mm.:::['7-11-252', '5-16-219', '3-16-41']
i will give you $100 to whistle right now.:::['7-11-253']
how can you eat the cheesecake without me? what are you gonna do?:::['7-11-254']
gonna run and tell monica or joey? no, you'd have to tell them what we did.:::['7-11-255']
we are dessert stealers. we are living outside the law.:::['7-11-256']
you know what? i don't trust you with this cake.:::['7-11-257']
and i got it first, and i'm taking it back. what?:::['7-11-258']
what? oh, no, you don't. oh, yes.:::['7-11-259']
you think i trust you with it?:::['7-11-260']
we're gonna split it. you take half, i take half.:::['7-11-261']
that's not fair. you had some.:::['7-11-262']
oh, you know what? i think monica would be very interested to know......that you called her cheesecake:::['7-11-263']
dry and mealy.:::['7-11-264']
what do we use to split it? okay.:::['7-11-265']
all right, pick a half. okay.:::['7-11-266']
well, this side looks bigger. mm-hm.:::['7-11-267']
uh, but there's more crust on this side.:::['7-11-268']
yeah. so maybe if i measure it...:::['7-11-269']
for god's sake, pick a piece.:::['7-11-270']
all right, i pick that one. so the smaller piece.:::['7-11-271']
okay. there you go.:::['7-11-272']
enjoy your half, my friend. but that is it.:::['7-11-273']
no sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me......if you eat your piece too fast.:::['7-11-274']
you gonna give me some of your piece? oh, no.:::['7-11-276']
no switching, no sharing. and don't come crying to me.:::['7-11-277']
ha, ha. i may just sit here and have my cake all day.:::['7-11-278']
just sit here in the hallway and eat my...:::['7-11-279']
never met a girl that could me feel... ross, sweetheart.:::['7-11-281']
oh, hey, aunt millie.:::['7-11-282']
isn't it a beautiful wedding? yes. yes, it is.:::['7-11-283']
every time, on the lips.:::['7-11-284']
why? why on the lips?:::['7-11-285', '7-11-334']
there's frannie. won't she be happy to see me?:::['7-11-286']
now, wait a minute. you be nice, all right?:::['7-11-287']
i didn't bring you here so you could ambush her.:::['7-11-288']
frannie was the one who found your playboys and showed them to mom.:::['7-11-289']
that bitch.:::['7-11-290']
monica. what...?:::['7-11-291']
am i doing here? surprised to see me?:::['7-11-292']
ross brought me. how do you like that?:::['7-11-293']
hi, frannie. congratulations.:::['7-11-294']
you invite my brother, you invite my whole family, and not me? why?:::['7-11-295']
why wouldn't you want me at your wedding? what could i have possibly done?:::['7-11-296']
stuart.:::['7-11-297']
i believe you know my husband.:::['7-11-298']
so it's really a question of "who" could you have possibly done.:::['7-11-299']
i hate this, but i have to go. mm-hm.:::['7-11-300']
i can't miss my flight.:::['7-11-301']
are you sure? i bet there's another flight to minsk in...:::['7-11-302']
july.:::['7-11-303']
that's really beautiful. what does it mean?:::['7-11-304']
"please clean my beakers.":::['7-11-305']
i don't get out of the lab much.:::['7-11-306']
i thought it meant something else.:::['7-11-307']
yeah, well, i really actually wanted to say, um......that.:::['7-11-308']
but, um, i figured i probably shouldn't because......you know, i have to leave.:::['7-11-309']
hmm. no, you're right. don't say it.:::['7-11-310']
i do, though.:::['7-11-311']
i do too.:::['7-11-312']
well, bye, phoebe.:::['7-11-313']
okay, now's not the time, joey, all right? you can yell at me tomorrow.:::['7-11-314']
no, no. no, pheebs. i'm not gonna yell at you.:::['7-11-315']
i just started thinking about you and david......and i remember how bummed you were:::['7-11-316']
the first time he left.:::['7-11-317']
oh, pheebs, come here.:::['7-11-318']
are you okay? no, i'm not okay.:::['7-11-319']
the only guy i've ever been crazy about is going to minsk......and i may never see him again.:::['7-11-320']
hey, you could always visit him.:::['7-11-321']
oh, right. like they're gonna let me have a passport.:::['7-11-322']
anything i can do? whatever you need.:::['7-11-323']
well, now......if you achieve positronic distillation:::['7-11-324']
of subatomic particles before he does......then he could come back.:::['7-11-325']
i could give it a shot.:::['7-11-326']
stick to your side. come on, now.:::['7-11-328']
oh, wait, i forgot my wrap.:::['7-11-330']
oh, okay, wait here.:::['7-11-331']
hi, sweetie. are you leaving?:::['7-11-332']
well... give us a kiss. come on.:::['7-11-333']
you know, i'm thinking about letting emma have her first cookie.:::['10-5-0']
her first cookie? she has cookies all the time.:::['10-5-1']
i've never given her a cookie.:::['10-5-2']
have you? no.:::['10-5-3']
no. and for the record, i've also never given her frosting from a can.:::['10-5-4']
hey, rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation......and we wondered:::['10-5-5']
if you would write one for us?:::['10-5-6']
of course. i would be honored.:::['10-5-7']
thanks. thank you.:::['10-5-8']
i think there's been an oversight.:::['10-5-9']
joe, we would have asked you. we thought you wouldn't be interested.:::['10-5-10']
yeah, it's just that we don't think of you as really being so much with the words.:::['10-5-11']
clearly, we were wrong.:::['10-5-12']
i got a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, okay?:::['10-5-13']
and i know how much you want to have a baby......and i would love to help you get one.:::['10-5-14']
you know what? then we want you to do it.:::['10-5-15']
thank you. all right. let me see how i'm gonna start.:::['10-5-16']
"dear baby adoption decider people...":::['10-5-17']
so excited about your letter.:::['10-5-18']

what you working on? monica and chandler's recommendation.:::['10-5-71']
i want it to sound smart, but i don't know any big words or anything.:::['10-5-72']
why don't you use your thesaurus? what did i just say?:::['10-5-73']
watch.:::['10-5-74']
here, you highlight the word you want to change, uh, go under "tools"......and the thesaurus generates... gives.:::['10-5-75']
gives a whole list of choices.:::['10-5-76']
you can pick the word that sounds smartest.:::['10-5-77']
my god, that's great. i'm smart.:::['10-5-78']
no, no, i'm::::['10-5-79']
"brainy, bright, clever." i love this thing!:::['10-5-80']
look out, ladies! joey tribbiani's got the whole package!:::['10-5-81']
amy: god......so beautiful.:::['10-5-82']
i know, isn't she?:::['10-5-83']
no, i was talking about your bedding.:::['10-5-84']
all right, what's your news, amy? oh. ahem.:::['10-5-85']
well......i'm getting married.:::['10-5-86']
wow! oh, my god!:::['10-5-87']
to who? this guy.:::['10-5-88']
he has a killer apartment.:::['10-5-89']
and? and it's on 5th.:::['10-5-90']
and the elevator opens up right into the living room.:::['10-5-91']
no, what's he like? oh, he's okay.:::['10-5-92']
do you remember my old boyfriend mark?:::['10-5-93']
yeah. it's his dad.:::['10-5-94']
huh. wow, so he's gotta be... old? yeah.:::['10-5-95']
but he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.:::['10-5-96']
sweetie, i gotta tell you, it sounds a little bit like......you like the apartment:::['10-5-97']
more than you like...:::['10-5-98']
myron.:::['10-5-99']
yeah, i told you he was old.:::['10-5-100']
sit down. sit down.:::['10-5-101']
oh, honey, you know......i once also almost married:::['10-5-102']
somebody that i didn't love.:::['10-5-103']
do you remember barry? remember him?:::['10-5-104']
god, we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.:::['10-5-105']
sometimes just nodding is okay.:::['10-5-106']
um... but anyway, listen.:::['10-5-107']
not marrying barry was the best decision that i ever, ever made.:::['10-5-108']
honey, amy, you deserve true love. your soul mate is out there somewhere.:::['10-5-109']
someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun......and that you care about.:::['10-5-110']
you're right. i'm gonna do it. okay.:::['10-5-112']
i'm gonna marry myron and keep looking for mr. right.:::['10-5-113']
okay, let's keep talking.:::['10-5-115']
phoebe: excuse me. anniversary.:::['10-5-116']
excuse me. anniversary.:::['10-5-117']
sir, could you move your nachos? they're in my seat.:::['10-5-119']
it's my anniversary.:::['10-5-120']
here we are.:::['10-5-121', '4-2-207']
i can't believe it's been a whole year. i know.:::['10-5-122']
this has been the best year...:::['10-5-123']
this has been the best year of my life! me too!:::['10-5-124']
i never thought i could love someone this much!:::['10-5-125']
i feel the same way!:::['10-5-126']
you're so generous and kind, and you're amazing in bed!:::['10-5-127']
it's our anniversary.:::['10-5-128']
announcer: please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard.:::['10-5-129', '10-5-341']
someone has a special question to ask.:::['10-5-130', '10-5-342']
crowd: aw...:::['10-5-131']
oh, how lame. it's so tacky and impersonal.:::['10-5-132']
really? it's the worst way to propose.:::['10-5-133']
hey. i finished my recommendation. here.:::['10-5-135']
and i think you'll be very, very happy.:::['10-5-136']
it's the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.:::['10-5-137']
some of the words a little too sophisticated for you?:::['10-5-139']
it doesn't make any sense.:::['10-5-140']
well, of course it does. it's smart. i used a thesaurus.:::['10-5-141']
on every word?:::['10-5-142']
all right, what was this sentence originally?:::['10-5-144']
"they are warm, nice people with big hearts.":::['10-5-145']
and that became, "they are humid, prepossessing homo sapiens......with full-sized aortic pumps.":::['10-5-146']
yeah. yeah. and hey, i really mean it, dude.:::['10-5-147']
all right, joey, i don't think we can use this.:::['10-5-148']
why not? well, because you signed it::::['10-5-149']
"baby kangaroo tribbiani.":::['10-5-150']
why don't you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself?:::['10-5-151']
you don't need a thesaurus. just write from here.:::['10-5-152']
your full-sized aortic pump.:::['10-5-153']
amy. hi. i took your advice.:::['10-5-154']
i left myron. good for you!:::['10-5-155']
i know. i'm erin brockovich.:::['10-5-156']
aw, i'm so proud of you. thank you.:::['10-5-158']
oh. so can i stay with you?:::['10-5-159']
but erin brockovich had her own house.:::['10-5-160']
ah, look who's back.:::['10-5-161']
why do you have bags? rach, why does she have bags?:::['10-5-162']
i'm staying with you guys.:::['10-5-163']
what? we're gonna be roomies!:::['10-5-164']
you slept out here? rachel: yeah.:::['10-5-166']
amy kept kicking me in her sleep, yelling, "myron, get off!":::['10-5-167']
but, uh, we're getting rid of her, right? please tell me we're getting rid of her?:::['10-5-168']
joey, i can't do that. oh, come on.:::['10-5-169']
last night i was finishing off a pizza, and she said::::['10-5-170']
"a moment on the lips, forever on the hips.":::['10-5-171']
i don't need that kind of talk in my house!:::['10-5-172']
joey, look, i know that she's difficult......but i think it's really good:::['10-5-173']
that she's here.:::['10-5-174']
because we'll appreciate it more when she's gone?:::['10-5-175']
no, it's just... look, when i first moved to this city, i was a lot like her.:::['10-5-176']
i was spoiled, self-centered. and you guys really took care of me.:::['10-5-177']
yeah. monica made us.:::['10-5-178']
well, whatever. i really appreciate it......because i don't think i would be:::['10-5-179']
the person that i am today......if it wasn't for you guys.:::['10-5-180']
so i want to help amy the way you guys helped me.:::['10-5-181']
and i know it's gonna take patience, but that's okay.:::['10-5-182']
good morning. yeah.:::['10-5-183']
amy, that's what i was supposed to wear today. that's why i hung it on the door.:::['10-5-184']
oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.:::['10-5-185']
amy, you know what? i was thinking that maybe now would be a good time......for us to sit down and, you know,talk about your future.:::['10-5-186']
oh, i can't, honey. i'm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped.:::['10-5-187']
i am not happy.:::['10-5-188']
uh... sure you want to eat that?:::['10-5-189']
i'm curvy and i like it!:::['10-5-190']
hi. rachel: hi.:::['10-5-191']
i just had the worst anniversary ever.:::['10-5-192']
i doubt that. tell her about us last year.:::['10-5-193']
oh, well, i bought chandler a $500 watch, and he wrote me a rap song.:::['10-5-194']
seriously? word.:::['10-5-195']
well, mine was worse than that.:::['10-5-196']
well, what happened? we were at the game......and this guy proposed to his girlfriend:::['10-5-197']
on the big screen thing.:::['10-5-198']
oh, that is so tacky. well, that's what i said.:::['10-5-199']
but it turns out mike was planning to propose to me that same way last night.:::['10-5-200']
oh, my god. mike was gonna propose?:::['10-5-201']
phoebe, that's huge. do you want to marry him?:::['10-5-202']
yeah, i really do. yes.:::['10-5-203']
but after i dumped on the way he was gonna propose......i don't think he's ever gonna ask again.:::['10-5-204']
i mean, i said no in barbados, and now this?:::['10-5-205']
she's right. if i were a guy and...:::['10-5-206']
did i just say, "if i were a guy"?:::['10-5-207']
maybe you don't need him to propose to you. maybe you could propose to him.:::['10-5-208']
oh, i don't know. i don't know. isn't that a little desperate?:::['10-5-209']
i proposed to chandler.:::['10-5-210']
all right, moving on.:::['10-5-211']
i don't think it was desperate. i think it was amazing.:::['10-5-212']
well, do you think i should propose? i think it could be kind of great.:::['10-5-214']
absolutely. you'll love the feeling. there's nothing like it.:::['10-5-215']
okay. okay. so how should i do it?:::['10-5-216']
how about at a game on the big screen?:::['10-5-217']
huh! how about at a foot locker?:::['10-5-218']
what? what, he obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to.:::['10-5-219']
plus, he'd never suspect it. yeah, that does make sense.:::['10-5-220']
okay, now, would you two like that? sounds good to me.:::['10-5-221']
but what would a guy think?:::['10-5-222']
uh, nana's on the phone. rachel: wow.:::['10-5-223']
that's interesting, since she died seven years ago.:::['10-5-224']
she did?:::['10-5-225']
who got her condo in boca?:::['10-5-226']
it's our nanny.:::['10-5-228']
oh, god, i hope you feel better. okay. bye.:::['10-5-230']
that's molly. she's sick.:::['10-5-231']
can you watch emma today? i can't. i have back-to-back classes.:::['10-5-232']
did molly say what she had? because my throat's been hurting.:::['10-5-233']
menstrual cramps.:::['10-5-234']
i don't think that's what this is.:::['10-5-235']
can any of you watch emma? no, i'm sorry, sweetie.:::['10-5-236']
no, i've got work, and then i'm proposing.:::['10-5-237']
great. shoot. what am i gonna do?:::['10-5-238']
well, i could do it.:::['10-5-239']
well, actually... can i talk to you for a second?:::['10-5-240']
um, i do not want her babysitting our child.:::['10-5-242']
why not? for one thing, she keeps calling her ella.:::['10-5-243']
ella's a nice name. fine, we'll call the next one ella.:::['10-5-244']
what, the next one? okay.:::['10-5-245']
i don't want her watching our baby.:::['10-5-246']
ross, i am trying to help her become a better person.:::['10-5-247']
this is a huge breakthrough for her.:::['10-5-248']
she just offered to do something for another human being.:::['10-5-249']
you know, i don't know. rachel: ross, i'm telling you......she's giving up getting her eyebrows:::['10-5-250']
shaped to do this, all right?:::['10-5-251']
do you understand how important that is in our world?:::['10-5-252']
uh, listen, i couldn't help but overhear, because i was trying to.:::['10-5-253']
listen, let me do this. i really want to help you guys out.:::['10-5-254']
and plus, rachel's been so wonderful to me.:::['10-5-255']
absolutely. oh, great!:::['10-5-256']
so how much does it pay?:::['10-5-257']
hey, joe. how's the second draft of the letter coming?:::['10-5-258']
great. i'm finished. in fact, i just dropped it off at the agency.:::['10-5-259']
you dropped it off? yeah.:::['10-5-260']
can we read it? can you print out another copy?:::['10-5-261']
no can do, amigo.:::['10-5-262']
no, i didn't use the computer. it felt more personal to handwrite it.:::['10-5-263']
you handwrote it? yeah, and don't worry.:::['10-5-264']
i didn't try to sound smart at all.:::['10-5-265']
oh, my god. oh, my god. that letter is gonna go in our file.:::['10-5-267']
we're never gonna get a kid.:::['10-5-268']
we're gonna be one of those old couples......that collects orchids:::['10-5-269']
or has a lot of birds.:::['10-5-270']
it's okay. it's okay. you know what?:::['10-5-271']
i will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter.:::['10-5-272']
okay, good.:::['10-5-273', '3-9-203', '3-25-296']
hello, this is chandler bing.:::['10-5-274']
someone just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter and...:::['10-5-275']
thank you. goodbye.:::['10-5-278']
we're screwed, aren't we?:::['10-5-279']
you know what? just tell me on the way to the bird store.:::['10-5-280']
they loved it. what?:::['10-5-281']
they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.:::['10-5-282']
they thought joey was a child?:::['10-5-283']
she guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.:::['10-5-284']
amy: hi. monica: what'd you guys do today?:::['10-5-285']
ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.:::['10-5-286']
that sounds like fun. yeah, not really.:::['10-5-287']
babies are dull.:::['10-5-288']
hey. hi, how's my girl? i'm fine.:::['10-5-289']
and i got you a present for letting me stay with you.:::['10-5-290']
ready? yeah.:::['10-5-291']
amy: ta-da!:::['10-5-292']
you pierced her ears?:::['10-5-293']
doesn't it make her nose look smaller?:::['10-5-294']
rachel: you pierced her ears?:::['10-5-295']
how could you do this without telling me?:::['10-5-296']
if i had told you, then it wouldn't have been a surprise, now would it?:::['10-5-297']
i think she looks cute.:::['10-5-298']
but i am wrong.:::['10-5-299']
oh, my god. oh, my god. here comes ross. he's gonna flip out.:::['10-5-300']
why, did something happen to his falafel cart?:::['10-5-301']
hey, guys. chandler: ross!:::['10-5-302']
hi, emma. oh. why is she wearing her hat so low?:::['10-5-303']
she can barely see. i don't really want her to see.:::['10-5-304']
because there are so many terrible sights in this world.:::['10-5-306']
like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember?:::['10-5-307']
it was in a milk carton, but it looked like meat?:::['10-5-308']
come here. come here.:::['10-5-309', '2-6-349']
there she is. hi.:::['10-5-310']
what...?:::['10-5-313']
please tell me those are clip-ons! oh, they're real.:::['10-5-314']
did she do this to her?:::['10-5-315']
i told you we shouldn't have left emma with her!:::['10-5-316']
rachel: i know. and you were right, ross.:::['10-5-317']
okay? you are so irresponsible! i am never letting you babysit again!:::['10-5-318']
you know what? this kid needs me, okay?:::['10-5-319']
she needs to have a cool, fun aunt. i'm a cool, fun aunt.:::['10-5-320']
hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects.:::['10-5-322']
all i wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life.:::['10-5-323']
this is how you repay me?:::['10-5-324']
i don't need you to help me. i already know what i'm gonna do with my life.:::['10-5-325']
oh, yeah? since when? since today.:::['10-5-326']
i am going to be a baby stylist.:::['10-5-327']
what? that's not a thing!:::['10-5-328']
well, it should be.:::['10-5-329']
i'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize......what colors to wear,what clothes are slimming.:::['10-5-330']
babies don't care if they're slim! enter amy.:::['10-5-331']
amy, i... i just... i just wanna... what? what are you gonna do?:::['10-5-332']
no more falafel for you!:::['10-5-333']
great game, huh? uh-huh.:::['10-5-334']
why do you keep looking at the screen? i'm not. i'm praying.:::['10-5-335']
please let the knicks win.:::['10-5-336']
thank you, thor.:::['10-5-337']
where are you going? i'm gonna go to the bathroom.:::['10-5-338']
well, i think you should wait. why?:::['10-5-339']
well, if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.:::['10-5-340']
mike hannigan, will you marry me?:::['10-5-343']
get a load of this. she's proposing to him!:::['10-5-344']
guess we know who wears the pants in that family.:::['10-5-345']
well, that's not very enlightened.:::['10-5-346']
boo us? boo you!:::['10-5-348']
hello? yeah, this is joey tribbiani.:::['10-5-349']
well, i'm glad you liked my letter.:::['10-5-351']
no, my mommy and daddy aren't home right now.:::['10-5-352']
okay, bye-bye.:::['10-5-353', '2-14-66']
she was nice.:::['10-5-354']
joey, get amy's bags. she is moving out.:::['10-5-355']
woo-hoo!:::['10-5-356', '3-9-278']
you're kicking me out? you put holes in my baby's ears.:::['10-5-357']
at least now people will know she's a girl!:::['10-5-358']
i can't believe i ever even tried to help you.:::['10-5-359']
you are so beyond help! you know what?:::['10-5-360']
ever since i got here, you have been nothing but negative.:::['10-5-361']
excuse me? you didn't want me......to marry the old guy:::['10-5-362']
with the great apartment.:::['10-5-363']
then i tried to help your daughter de-emphasize her flaws......and suddenly i'm the bad guy?:::['10-5-364']
joey, where are those bags? joey: she has a lot of crap!:::['10-5-365']
you know? when i moved in here, i thought, "this will be so great.:::['10-5-366']
just us sisters back together again like when we were kids.":::['10-5-367']
except without that stupid jill. oh.:::['10-5-368']
who has gotten fat, by the way.:::['10-5-369']
mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.:::['10-5-371']
hips or thighs? ass and face.:::['10-5-372']
oh, my god! i thought she was on atkins.:::['10-5-373']
she was. carbs found her.:::['10-5-374']
see? this is what i wanted.:::['10-5-375']
two sisters talking about real stuff.:::['10-5-376']
oh, i can give you that.:::['10-5-377']
you can? rachel: yeah.:::['10-5-378']
i kept trying to make you a better person, but you're...:::['10-5-379']
you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.:::['10-5-380']
you gotta admit, emma does look cute.:::['10-5-382']
did you just say, "emma"? oh, i'm sorry. ella.:::['10-5-383']
that woman didn't know what she was talking about, mike.:::['10-5-384']
obviously, you have balls.:::['10-5-385']
please, let's just forget the whole thing. phoebe: i would love it.:::['10-5-386']
consider it forgotten. thank you.:::['10-5-387']
but just so you know...:::['10-5-388']
however and whenever you decide to propose, i promise i'll say yes.:::['10-5-389']
whether, you know, it's at a basketball game......or in skywriting......or, you know, like some lame:::['10-5-390']
guy in a cheesy movie......who hides it in the cake.:::['10-5-391']
it's in the cake, isn't it?:::['10-5-392']
where else would lame mr. no-balls hide it?:::['10-5-393']
what's the matter with me? why do i keep ruining this?:::['10-5-394']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. no, it's my fault.:::['10-5-395']
i keep trying to propose in these stupid ways......and i just wanna tell you i love you,and i wanna spend my life with you...:::['10-5-396']
i'm gonna do this now. oh, my god.:::['10-5-397']
phoebe, i... wait. oh, wait.:::['10-5-398']
ready? uh-huh.:::['10-5-400', '5-22-124']
there's no one else in the world i would ask to marry me three times.:::['10-5-403']
but i want to take care of you......have babies with you......and grow old with you.:::['10-5-404']
phoebe buffay, will you marry me?:::['10-5-405']
i love you. i love you more.:::['10-5-407']
not possible.:::['10-5-408']
she's gonna be mrs. no-balls!:::['10-5-409']
so how's the, uh, baby-styling business going?:::['10-5-410']
not that great.:::['10-5-411']
it's almost as if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.:::['10-5-412']
there's ross. hey, ross.:::['10-5-414']
hello, ross?:::['10-5-415', '5-20-89']
he's rude.:::['10-5-416']
hey, guys. all: hey.:::['10-4-0']
honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend.:::['10-4-1']
that place in vermont? you can take a hint.:::['10-4-2']
you can't go away this weekend. it's emma's birthday.:::['10-4-3']
yeah. we're having a party.:::['10-4-4']
can't you have the party when we get back?:::['10-4-5']
no. no. it won't be her real birthday.:::['10-4-6']
gee, if only she were 1 and had no idea what the hell a birthday was.:::['10-4-7']
come on, you guys, this is really important to us.:::['10-4-8']
sorry, but chandler and i could really use a weekend away......you know, to reconnect, emotionally.:::['10-4-9']
there's this thing i really want us to do.:::['10-4-10']
i read about it in maxim.:::['10-4-11']
well, can't you just go to vermont the next day?:::['10-4-12']
yeah, we want everyone to be there.:::['10-4-13']
as much as i hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.:::['10-4-14']
and, i mean, you know, you guys, this is a big deal.:::['10-4-15']
i mean, how can we have her first birthday party... ...without her aunt and her uncle?:::['10-4-16']
all right, we'll stay. we can just drive up after the party.:::['10-4-17']
fine. but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this party...:::['10-4-18']
believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that.:::['10-4-19']
you know, pheebs, when i was little, on my birthday......my daddy would hide a present:::['10-4-20']
in every room of the house.:::['10-4-21']
and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find them all.:::['10-4-22']
aw, i love family traditions like that.:::['10-4-23']
when ursula and i were kids, on our birthday......our stepdad would sell his blood:::['10-4-24']
to buy us food.:::['10-4-25']
hey, guys. rachel & phoebe: hi.:::['10-4-26']
i brought the camera for emma's video. oh, good!:::['10-4-27']
we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma......and we'll give it to her when she's 18.:::['10-4-28']
oh, cool.:::['10-4-29', '2-5-114']
wow, it's like a time capsule. ross: yeah.:::['10-4-30']
oh, just think, she's gonna be watching that video on a tv......that hasn't even been invented yet......with friends who, right now,are just, like, babies.:::['10-4-31']
and they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built......to escape the ant people.:::['10-4-32']
that's the hope.:::['10-4-33']
so is emma awake yet? no, it's still naptime.:::['10-4-34']
but she'll be up soon. where's joey?:::['10-4-35']
i said, it's still naptime.:::['10-4-36']
hey, there's uncle joey. joey: hey.:::['10-4-37']
hey, say something to emma on her 18th birthday.:::['10-4-38']
eighteen, huh? joey, no!:::['10-4-39']
what? what? it's for her hot friends.:::['10-4-40']
when they see this, you'll be 52.:::['10-4-41']
and starting to think about settling down.:::['10-4-42']
hey, joey, will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on?:::['10-4-43']
love to. yeah.:::['10-4-44']
we were supposed to bring presents? yeah. i wrote emma a song.:::['10-4-45']
oh, yeah. how was i supposed to know?:::['10-4-46']
joey, it's a birthday party. yeah, but for a 1 -year-old.:::['10-4-47']
what's the point? the other day she laughed for, like, an hour at a cup.:::['10-4-48']
just a cup with a picture of elmo on it, dressed as a farmer.:::['10-4-49']
and he's standing next to this cow, and the cow says, "el-moo.":::['10-4-50']
man, that's a funny cup.:::['10-4-51']
where's the birthday girl? oh, she's still napping.:::['10-4-53']
she was probably up all night excited about the party she knows is happening.:::['10-4-54']
i know you guys really want to get to vermont, and this isn't a big deal to you.:::['10-4-55']
but it really is to us, okay? emma will never have a first birthday again.:::['10-4-56']
you're right. we're sorry.:::['10-4-57']
let's wake up emma and get the fun time started!:::['10-4-58']
no, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her.:::['10-4-59']
are you frigging kidding me, green?:::['10-4-60']
both: hi! ross: hey!:::['10-4-61']
rachel: i'm so glad you came. i can't believe emma's already 1.:::['10-4-62']
i remember your first birthday.:::['10-4-63']
ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you.:::['10-4-64']
he pulled on his testicles so hard......we had to take him:::['10-4-65']
to the emergency room.:::['10-4-66']
there's something you didn't know about your dad.:::['10-4-67']
hey, mr. and mrs. geller. let me help you with that.:::['10-4-68']
thank you. oh, man, this is great, huh?:::['10-4-69']
the three of us together again. you know what would be fun?:::['10-4-70']
if we gave this present to emma from all of us.:::['10-4-71']
which one are you?:::['10-4-72']
i can't believe emma's still asleep. i know. what are we gonna do?:::['10-4-73']
i've got a plan. i've got a plan.:::['10-4-74']
i'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs.:::['10-4-75']
you're gonna scream out, and that'll wake her up.:::['10-4-76']
i'm not going to vermont with this monica.:::['10-4-77']
hey, pheebs? you know what?:::['10-4-78']
i was thinking since you wrote a song......maybe i could do something:::['10-4-79']
for emma using my talents.:::['10-4-80']
so you're gonna hit on her?:::['10-4-81']
no, no, no. my talents as an actor. phoebe: oh.:::['10-4-82']
you know, i could, like, maybe...:::['10-4-83']
i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books.:::['10-4-84']
or you could stick a fork in an apple.:::['10-4-85']
hey, i think emma might like it. oh, emma might like what?:::['10-4-86']
uh, my present. what did you get her?:::['10-4-87']
actually, we prepared performances. separate performances.:::['10-4-88']
but equally real.:::['10-4-89']
that sounds like fun.:::['10-4-90', '5-9-49']
you know what, actually? people are getting a little antsy waiting for emma to wake up from her nap.:::['10-4-91']
so would you mind performing them once now?:::['10-4-92']
sure, yeah! okay.:::['10-4-93']
okay. all right. everybody, let's get this party started, huh?:::['10-4-94']
joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.:::['10-4-95']
aren't you gonna be embarrassed having nothing prepared?:::['10-4-97']
i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting.:::['10-4-98']
so, joey, what are you gonna do for us?:::['10-4-99']
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma's books.:::['10-4-100']
oh, okay. which one?:::['10-4-101']
uh, well, it's one of her favorites.:::['10-4-102']
"riding the storm out: coping with postpartum depression.":::['10-4-103']
love you forever.:::['10-4-104']
"love you forever, by robert munsch. published by firefly books. printed......in mexico.:::['10-4-105']
ahem. a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him......back and forth, back and forth,back and forth.:::['10-4-106']
and while she held him, she sang, 'i'll love you forever.:::['10-4-107']
i'll like you for always. as long as i'm living......my baby you'll be."':::['10-4-108']
"and while he rocked her, he sang::::['10-4-109']
'i'll love you forever. i'll like you for always.:::['10-4-110']
as long as i'm living......my baby you'll be."':::['10-4-111']
that was amazing.:::['10-4-113', '5-17-206']
thank you so much for that gift.:::['10-4-114']
i was not ready for this today.:::['10-4-115']
amazing. amazing. rachel: phoebe, i'm sorry.:::['10-4-116']
phoebe has prepared something. phoebe: that's right.:::['10-4-117']
i prepared a song for emma, from my heart to hers.:::['10-4-118']
for there's no greater gift than the gift of music.:::['10-4-119']
emma:::['10-4-120']
your name poses a dilemma:::['10-4-121']
'cause not much else rhymes with emma:::['10-4-122']
maybe the actor, richard crenna:::['10-4-123']
he played the commanding officer in rambo.:::['10-4-124']
happy birthday, emma:::['10-4-125']
is that it?:::['10-4-126']
no, i've also, you know, prepared a reading.:::['10-4-128']
um, "sex and the single mother.":::['10-4-129']
"finding your g-spot." all: oh, no, no, no!:::['10-4-130']
hello, emma. happy 18th birthday.:::['10-4-131']
right now, that seems so far away, 17 years.:::['10-4-132']
yes. you'll be all grown up by then, and we'll be...:::['10-4-133']
well, your grandfather and i might not be here.:::['10-4-134']
that's true. this message could be coming to you......from beyond the grave, emma.:::['10-4-135']
after all, my parents died very young. and my cholesterol's off the charts.:::['10-4-136']
remember, emma, heart disease kills women too.:::['10-4-137']
okay, cut! great. great. that was just...:::['10-4-138']
yeah. judy: oh, good.:::['10-4-139']
ross, uh, don't forget to get a shot of emma's cake.:::['10-4-140']
it's in a box in the fridge. okay, sure.:::['10-4-141']
you're gonna love this cake. i got it from a bakery in new jersey, carino's.:::['10-4-142']
oh, my god, that place has the creamiest frosting.:::['10-4-143']
i used to hitchhike there when i was a kid.:::['10-4-144']
well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes......in all different shapes. and if you give:::['10-4-145']
them a photo, they'll copy it in icing.:::['10-4-146']
did you do a picture of emma? yes. on a cake shaped like a bunny.:::['10-4-147']
uh, rach? does this bakery by any chance also bake......erotic cakes?:::['10-4-148']
say, for bachelorette parties?:::['10-4-149']
rachel: ross, what are you talking...? oh, my god!:::['10-4-150']
they put my baby's face on a penis!:::['10-4-151']
now it's a party!:::['10-4-152']
wait, you guys, this isn't funny, all right?:::['10-4-153']
if i wanted this cake to be a disaster, i would have baked it myself!:::['10-4-154']
uh... is it okay that i still think it looks delicious?:::['10-4-155']
jack, look at this. i know what you're thinking, judy.:::['10-4-156']
the resemblance is uncanny.:::['10-4-157']
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again.:::['10-4-158']
no, no, this is not what i ordered, okay?:::['10-4-159']
i went all the way to new jersey so that i could have the perfect cake......for my daughter's birthday.:::['10-4-160']
and i need a bunny cake right now!:::['10-4-161']
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby's face off the penis......so we could put it on the bunny.:::['10-4-162']
that is a weird sentence.:::['10-4-163']
oh, believe you me, i am going to bring this cake back.:::['10-4-164']
i don't even want it in my home. don't touch it!:::['10-4-165']
i'm so confused!:::['10-4-166']
yes, i still want my daughter's picture, but on a bunny cake!:::['10-4-167']
yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!:::['10-4-168']
to be fair, this one does have nuts.:::['10-4-169']
hey, mon, it was nice of you to loan rachel your car......so she could get the cake.:::['10-4-170']
it was nice of her to pull my hair......till i dropped the key.:::['10-4-171']
well, while we're waiting, you could tape your message to emma......for her 18th birthday, huh? okay?:::['10-4-172']
hi, emma. it's the year 2020.:::['10-4-173']
are you still enjoying your nap?:::['10-4-174']
we're aunt monica and uncle chandler, by the way.:::['10-4-175']
you may not recognize us......because we haven't spoken:::['10-4-176']
to your parents in 17 years.:::['10-4-177']
we used to be married.:::['10-4-178']
but then we missed a weekend away together, and things kind of unraveled......because of you.:::['10-4-179']
happy birthday.:::['10-4-180', '5-3-141']
ross, rachel promised it would be over by now.:::['10-4-181']
we seriously have to go if we want to get to vermont.:::['10-4-182']
the last train leaves in a half-hour. and i have a massage client soon.:::['10-4-183']
you guys, just, please, a little bit longer.:::['10-4-184']
i promise, rachel will be back with the cake any minute.:::['10-4-185']
monica, remember the frosting, huh?:::['10-4-186']
all right, five more minutes.:::['10-4-187']
oh, no, what happened?:::['10-4-189']
okay, okay, where are you?:::['10-4-190']
okay, i'll be right there.:::['10-4-191']
was that emma? is she up?:::['10-4-192']
rachel got pulled over for speeding.:::['10-4-193']
she forgot her license. so i have to bring it to her.:::['10-4-194']
if you're leaving, i'm definitely going. wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!:::['10-4-195']
we've been complaining the longest!:::['10-4-196']
no, wait, you guys. no, you can't leave.:::['10-4-197']
rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up.:::['10-4-198']
how do you think she'll feel when she comes back and you're gone?:::['10-4-199']
i don't know. you'll tell us on monday.:::['10-4-200']
joey, you're in charge, okay? you make sure nobody leaves.:::['10-4-201']
got it!:::['10-4-202']
hey! where do you think you're going?:::['10-4-203']
to the bathroom.:::['10-4-204']
well, the rest of you get comfortable, okay... ...because we are gonna be here for a...:::['10-4-205']
wait, there's a window in there. oh, no! he's not getting away that easy!:::['10-4-206']
chandler: what are you doing? get the hell out of here!:::['10-4-207']
well, that one did not have emma's face on it.:::['10-4-208']
no, it did not. no.:::['10-4-209']
well, we'd better get going. it's late.:::['10-4-210']
jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. he has trouble staying in his lane.:::['10-4-211']
last winter i went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene.:::['10-4-212']
the papers thought it was a hate crime.:::['10-4-213']
anyway, it was lovely seeing you. okay.:::['10-4-214']
judy: bye. bye, dear. nighty-night.:::['10-4-215']
judy: nighty-night. joey: bye.:::['10-4-216']
how could you just let them leave? joey: hey, hey.:::['10-4-217']
i'm not gonna mess with jack. he's a great man. he fought for our country.:::['10-4-218']
no, he didn't. he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea.:::['10-4-219']
well, that's it. he's the last one to go. i'm locking you guys in. ha.:::['10-4-220']
you do know i can just turn them the other way around, right?:::['10-4-221']
oh, i forgot you used to live here.:::['10-4-222']
hey. so how'd your audition go today?:::['10-4-224']
what audition? the one i told you about last week.:::['10-4-225']
what? you never said anything about an audition.:::['10-4-226']
let me start over. i just got a call about an audition.:::['10-4-227']
i think you can still make it.:::['10-4-228']
it's down at the astor theater, and you need to have a monologue prepared.:::['10-4-229']
a monologue? i don't have a...:::['10-4-230']
i got it. uh...:::['10-4-231']
so i'm gonna take off.:::['10-4-232']
what? what? wait! you don't get to leave.:::['10-4-233']
i've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute.:::['10-4-234']
and we paid for a room that we're supposed to be in right now!:::['10-4-235']
well, okay, now......only one of us has to stay with emma.:::['10-4-236']
okay, and as the person who realized that, i get to go.:::['10-4-237']
no, no, no. no. no.:::['10-4-238']
let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.:::['10-4-239']
oh, i got it.:::['10-4-240']
okay, everyone pick a number from one to 10, all right?:::['10-4-241']
whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.:::['10-4-242']
okay, 10. okay, monica picks 10. i call nine.:::['10-4-243']
anyone else?:::['10-4-244']
no, let's just draw straws. monica: okay.:::['10-4-245']
or we could flip a coin and multiply the answer...:::['10-4-246']
i'm begging you to stop. right.:::['10-4-247']
okay, how about this? we got wind-up toys for emma for her birthday.:::['10-4-248']
we can make them race, and whoever comes in last stays.:::['10-4-249']
that sounds more fun than the thing we were gonna do in vermont!:::['10-4-251']
okay, everybody, pick your toys! okay. i want the dolphin!:::['10-4-252']
that's a bear. i'm too excited!:::['10-4-253']
phoebe, you get the bear. joey, you get the robot.:::['10-4-254']
oh, yeah. and chandler and i get the dog.:::['10-4-255']
and the race is going to go from here to here.:::['10-4-256']
now, the one who comes in last stays!:::['10-4-257']
okay, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys.:::['10-4-258']
okay. on your mark, get set, go! phoebe: go! go!:::['10-4-259']
joey: come on, robot!:::['10-4-260']
what are you barking at?:::['10-4-261']
well, how is that gonna help?:::['10-4-262']
i bought you! how did i forget that that's all you do?:::['10-4-263']
joey: way to go, robot!:::['10-4-264']
good job, alan.:::['10-4-265']
hey, good race, you guys. yeah, see you later.:::['10-4-266']
no. no, no. wait.:::['10-4-267']
we didn't lose.:::['10-4-268']
the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser.:::['10-4-269']
well, our dog never crossed the finish line. so technically...:::['10-4-270']
they left.:::['10-4-271']
there isn't time to go to the bakery. we're just gonna come home.:::['10-4-272']
everybody left?:::['10-4-273']
all right. well, just tell emma that we'll be there as soon as we can. bye.:::['10-4-274']
rachel! oh, god, sorry!:::['10-4-275']
i can't believe they gave you a ticket. you're such a good driver.:::['10-4-276']
emma's awake. yeah?:::['10-4-277']
this is her first birthday, she's awake, we're not even there.:::['10-4-279']
everybody left. we still have this stupid obscene cake.:::['10-4-280']
hey, maybe i can fix that. you know, try to turn it into something else.:::['10-4-281']
oh, don't even bother.:::['10-4-282']
we've already ruined her first birthday.:::['10-4-283']
and do you know how important these early experiences are, ross? very!:::['10-4-284']
according to the back cover of that book that you gave me.:::['10-4-285']
rach, she's not gonna remember this.:::['10-4-286']
oh, i just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know?:::['10-4-288']
emma laughing......and everybody gathered around:::['10-4-289']
her cake, singing "happy birthday.":::['10-4-290']
and then we would all... hey, get out of the road, you stupid student driver!:::['10-4-291']
they have to learn.:::['10-4-292']
hey. what?:::['10-4-293']
this is not bad.:::['10-4-294']
oh, my god. look, you made it into a bunny. how did you do that?:::['10-4-295']
well, i just made these two things cheeks.:::['10-4-296']
and then i split this to make ears.:::['10-4-297']
well, i am very impressed.:::['10-4-298']
some can sing, some can dance.:::['10-4-299']
i, apparently, can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.:::['10-4-300']
now, another way to organize your stuffed animals is by size.:::['10-4-301']
i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?:::['10-4-302']
game?:::['10-4-303']
emma, do you even know it's your birthday today? you're 1.:::['10-4-304']
one year old. that's little.:::['10-4-305']
that's my girl.:::['10-4-306']
that's how old you are.:::['10-4-307']
did i teach her that? did i just impart wisdom?:::['10-4-308']
aw, i want one.:::['10-4-309']
there's no one around. why don't we just take this one?:::['10-4-311']
and head to canada. i was kidding.:::['10-4-312']
i wasn't. let's get going.:::['10-4-313']
hey, are ross and rachel back? no, not yet.:::['10-4-314']
phoebe: good, i didn't miss the party. what about your massage client?:::['10-4-315']
i just felt so bad missing this. so i just slipped him a little something, you know.:::['10-4-316']
as long as i'm back in five or six hours, it'll be all right.:::['10-4-317']
if ross and rachel ask, i've been here the whole time. the whole time.:::['10-4-319']
i've been here the whole time.:::['10-4-320']
joey, we just saw you come in. you ran past us on the stairs.:::['10-4-321']
i don't care that you left. i'm just glad that you're here. thanks, you guys.:::['10-4-322']
hey, guys, come on. you gotta see what emma just did.:::['10-4-323']
rachel: what? emma, how old are you?:::['10-4-324']
how old are you today?:::['10-4-325']
oh, emma, that's right. you're that many.:::['10-4-326']
oh, my god, our daughter's a genius.:::['10-4-327']
this means... no! no science camp!:::['10-4-328']
damn it! i'll put a candle on the cake. oh...:::['10-4-329']
oh, and, emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly.:::['10-4-330']
emma's first birthday cake.:::['10-4-333']
go ahead, emma, blow out the candle.:::['10-4-334']
joey: come on, emma. you can do it.:::['10-4-335']
what's wrong? are you okay? oh, yeah, nothing.:::['10-4-336']
these are happy tears. ha, ha.:::['10-4-337']
this is just what i wanted.:::['10-4-338']
hey, you made it into a bunny.:::['10-4-339']
what is wrong with me? it looked more delicious when it was a penis.:::['10-4-340']
okay. yeah. okay, you ready?:::['10-4-341']
and record. okay.:::['10-4-342']
hi, emma. well, your first birthday is over, and...:::['10-4-343']
all: go! go! come on!:::['10-4-344']
go! go, alan! run, you hairy bastard!:::['10-4-345']
mm, hey. rachel: hi.:::['10-6-0']
pheebs, what's wrong?:::['10-6-1']
ah, i'm just so exhausted from dragging around this huge engagement ring.:::['10-6-2']
oh, my god. congratulations. wow.:::['10-6-3']
so did he get on one knee? did he have a speech prepared?:::['10-6-4']
oh, did he cry?:::['10-6-5']
yeah, big surprise, i like proposals.:::['10-6-6']
well, it was really sweet, and, like, the most romantic thing ever.:::['10-6-7']
here's to phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world.:::['10-6-8']
to phoebe and...:::['10-6-9']
i want to say "mike"?:::['10-6-10']
to phoebe and mike. rachel: hey.:::['10-6-11']
thank you. rachel: oh. oh, and i have something for you. hmm.:::['10-6-12']
it's my little black book. it's got the numbers of all the guys i've dated.:::['10-6-13']
oh, ha, ha. phoebe, that's nice, but you know what? i think i'm okay.:::['10-6-14']
give it to one of your other single girlfriends.:::['10-6-15']
i would, but you're the last one.:::['10-6-16']
give me the book!:::['10-6-17']
"pablo diaz.:::['10-6-18']
brady smith." ha.:::['10-6-19']
"guy in van"?:::['10-6-20']
oh, my first love.:::['10-6-21']
what does the red x next to bob gremore's name mean?:::['10-6-23']
dead.:::['10-6-24']
oh, it's okay. no, he was old. yeah.:::['10-6-25']
and he lived a full life. he was in the first wave at omaha beach.:::['10-6-26']
i should've given you guys my black book when i got married.:::['10-6-27']
although, it wasn't so much a book as a napkin.:::['10-6-28']
with janice's phone number on it.:::['10-6-29']
phoebe, isn't jethro tull a band?:::['10-6-30']
oh, yes, they are.:::['10-6-31']
hey, honey.:::['10-6-32']
is monica not here? no.:::['10-6-34']
oh, then i'll tell you. my agency was bidding for a big account, and they got it.:::['10-6-35']
it's my first national commercial. cool.:::['10-6-36']
and i don't want to brag, but a lot of the ideas were mine.:::['10-6-37']
hell, you weren't there. all the ideas were mine.:::['10-6-38']
that's great. hey, can you cast me in it?:::['10-6-39']
oh, i really don't think you're right for the part.:::['10-6-40']
what do you mean? i can do anything. i'm a chameleon, huh?:::['10-6-41']
i'm old.:::['10-6-42']
huh, i'm tired, huh?:::['10-6-43']
cold, huh? come on, what can't i do?:::['10-6-44']
first of all, bravo.:::['10-6-45']
uh, but i don't think you're right for this.:::['10-6-46']
the part's a stuffy college professor.:::['10-6-47']
i can do that. hello, i'm your professor.:::['10-6-48']
when i'm not busy thinking of important things, or professing......i like to use...:::['10-6-49']
oh, what's the product?:::['10-6-50']
software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions.:::['10-6-51']
i'm cold.:::['10-6-52']
guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant?:::['10-6-54']
i'll give you a hint. he's looking right at you.:::['10-6-55']
huh, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt......i'm gonna say, "congratulations.":::['10-6-56']
ha, ha. uh, i'm so excited. apparently, i beat out hundreds of other applicants......including five guys:::['10-6-57']
i went to graduate school with.:::['10-6-58']
not that i'm keeping score, or anything. five.:::['10-6-59']
wow, that's great. yeah.:::['10-6-60']
so tell me about the grant. well, okay, it's for $25,000.:::['10-6-61']
and if i get it, i'll finally be able to complete my field research.:::['10-6-62']
and there will be an article about me in the paleontology review.:::['10-6-63']
it'll be the first time my name is in there......without people raising:::['10-6-64']
serious questions about my work.:::['10-6-65']
are you talking about the dewer grant? yeah. why?:::['10-6-66']
benjamin hobart is administering that grant.:::['10-6-67']
your ex-boyfriend? yeah.:::['10-6-68']
so your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant?:::['10-6-69']
wow, your new boyfriend is screwed.:::['10-6-70']
no. no, we ended on great terms.:::['10-6-71']
if anything, i think this could help you. you know what?:::['10-6-72']
why don't we all go out to dinner, and i can introduce you.:::['10-6-73']
if you think it'd help. yeah, absolutely. i'll call him.:::['10-6-74']
now, is there anything i could do to butter him up?:::['10-6-75']
anything he really likes? hmm.:::['10-6-76']
he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.:::['10-6-77']
we'll see how dinner goes.:::['10-6-78']
hey. hey, you want to go see a movie?:::['10-6-79']
i told you i had to spend all day clearing out stuff so mike could move in.:::['10-6-80']
now that i'm here, i might as well help with the cleaning and organizing.:::['10-6-82']
i just happen to have my label maker.:::['10-6-83']
oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff.:::['10-6-84']
did you and chandler make compromises when you moved in together?:::['10-6-85']
huh, chandler did.:::['10-6-86']
what does he want you to give up? a bunch of stuff.:::['10-6-87']
and the worst one... he wants me to get rid of gladys.:::['10-6-88']
who's gladys?:::['10-6-89']
oh, what a tragic loss. mm-hm.:::['10-6-90']
yeah, i really hate to give her up. oh, i know. oh, you should take her.:::['10-6-91']
oh, i... i don't know.:::['10-6-92']
oh, what, you don't like her? heh, of course i do. what's not to like?:::['10-6-93']
i'd take her in a minute.:::['10-6-94']
but i think that you're giving up too easy.:::['10-6-95']
i think that you need to fight for her.:::['10-6-96']
really, you think? absolutely.:::['10-6-97']
you say to him, "i'm sorry, mike, i can't live without her.:::['10-6-98']
she means too much to me.":::['10-6-99']
okay, i'll fight for her. okay.:::['10-6-100']
oh, wait. oh, i just realized, if i do that, that means you don't get her.:::['10-6-101']
damn it, i did not think this through.:::['10-6-102']
hey, guys. hi.:::['10-6-103']
oh, any word on casting yet?:::['10-6-104']
i told you, you're not right for the part. joey: what do you mean?:::['10-6-105']
rach, don't i seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?:::['10-6-106']
i'm sorry, this sounds like something i'm never gonna be interested in.:::['10-6-107']
look, come on, please? it's not like i'm asking you for some crazy favor.:::['10-6-108']
this is what i do for a living. i am a professional actor.:::['10-6-109']
oh, man, i'm two hours late for work.:::['10-6-110']
here's my reel. it's got all the commercials that i've been in.:::['10-6-111']
joe... uh, just watch it.:::['10-6-112']
if you don't like it, don't pass it on to your bosses.:::['10-6-113']
work, joe. damn it.:::['10-6-115']
what am i gonna do now? just pass the tape along.:::['10-6-116']
he's not right for the part.:::['10-6-117']
if i suggest him, my bosses will think i'm an idiot.:::['10-6-118']
and that's something they should learn on their own.:::['10-6-119']
oh, just tell joey that you watched the tape......and you liked it,but your bosses didn't.:::['10-6-120']
then you're the good guy, and they're the bad guy.:::['10-6-121']
that's good. i liked it, they didn't.:::['10-6-122']
joey, for god's sake, go to work.:::['10-6-123']
i can't believe i'm about to meet benjamin hobart.:::['10-6-124']
um, i've always thought of him as someone i'd invite......to my fantasy dinner party, ha, ha.:::['10-6-125']
do you think there's any chance he'll bring christie brinkley or c-3po?:::['10-6-126']
sorry, it looks like it's just him.:::['10-6-127']
charlie.:::['10-6-128']
my god, you look absolutely stunning. oh.:::['10-6-129']
well, i am having a good hair day.:::['10-6-130']
it's so good to see you. charlie: oh, you too.:::['10-6-131']
benjl: mm.:::['10-6-132']
ahem, i'm okay.:::['10-6-133']
um, i'm sorry. um, ross geller, benjamin hobart.:::['10-6-134']
oh, it's an honor to meet you. i can't tell you how long......i've been an admirer of your work.:::['10-6-135']
i mean, that nobel prize, uh, whoo!:::['10-6-136']
ha, ha. oh.:::['10-6-137', '4-18-285']
i mean, i have to tell you that you're one of the reasons i got into the field.:::['10-6-138']
oh, well, uh, likewise.:::['10-6-139']
uh, not likewise. i'd never heard of you until this morning.:::['10-6-140']
but it's nice to be nice.:::['10-6-141']
uh, shall we? yeah, ahem. thank you. ahem.:::['10-6-142']
i can't believe that you chose this restaurant.:::['10-6-143']
do you remember the night? oh, my god. i completely forgot.:::['10-6-144']
benjl: ha-ha-ha. oh, my god. i can't believe they let us back in this place.:::['10-6-145']
you weren't there. ha, ha.:::['10-6-146']
no, but, you know, it's just a funny image.:::['10-6-147']
you know, the two of you in this restaurant with the hmm...:::['10-6-148']
why don't you tell benji about your proposal while i go to the ladies' room.:::['10-6-149']
so tell me about it.:::['10-6-150']
okay. well, i would like to do a dig in the painted desert.:::['10-6-151']
there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.:::['10-6-153']
break up with charlie. what?:::['10-6-154']
did you just say, "break up with charlie"?:::['10-6-156']
well, yes and no. yes, i did say it. and no, i didn't not say it.:::['10-6-157']
um, kind of inappropriate, don't you think? listen, i'm sorry.:::['10-6-158']
i just haven't seen her for so long, all these feelings are rushing back.:::['10-6-159']
i'm starting to realize how much i've missed her.:::['10-6-160']
and i'm gonna need you to break up with her.:::['10-6-161']
are you serious? if you say, yes, then i'm serious.:::['10-6-162']
if you say, no, then i'm joking.:::['10-6-163']
no. joking it is.:::['10-6-164']
hi, sorry i'm late. hey, how'd it go with mike?:::['10-6-165']
is he gonna let you keep the painting? huh, no, he really hates it, ugh.:::['10-6-166']
but he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair.:::['10-6-167']
so you gotta pick your battles. but the good news is, gladys is yours.:::['10-6-168']
wow, what's the bad news?:::['10-6-169']
who's gladys? oh, she's that work of art i made.:::['10-6-170']
you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.:::['10-6-171']
ah, and monica gets to keep her?:::['10-6-172']
in her house? i am so jealous.:::['10-6-173']
oh, i didn't know you wanted her too. oh.:::['10-6-174']
well, i mean, sure, of course.:::['10-6-175']
but you already gave that to monica, so...:::['10-6-176']
you know, i would give her up for you. no, i couldn't let you do that.:::['10-6-177']
no, but i want to. but i don't want you to.:::['10-6-178']
but i insist. but i insist harder.:::['10-6-179']
girls. girls. stop. okay, we'll flip a coin.:::['10-6-180']
heads, she's rachel's. tails, she's monica's.:::['10-6-181']
tails. rachel: oh. monica, she's yours. no, that landed in your food.:::['10-6-182']
no, no, that's okay. you won fair and square. i'm so sad.:::['10-6-183']
hey, joe? what's up?:::['10-6-184']
bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses......and they weren't interested.:::['10-6-185']
i'm sorry, man.:::['10-6-187', '2-18-323', '5-10-88']
but, uh, you watched the tape? yeah, i... i liked it.:::['10-6-188']
but, uh, my bosses didn't go for it. stupid sons of bitches.:::['10-6-189']
you didn't watch the tape. what? of course i did.:::['10-6-190']
look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?:::['10-6-191']
i'm not lying to you. i watched it. ah, you lied again.:::['10-6-192']
i watched it. keep going, pinocchio.:::['10-6-193']
i did. no, you didn't!:::['10-6-194']
i'm telling you, i watched the tape.:::['10-6-195']
did you watch the tape? no.:::['10-6-196']
the selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists.:::['10-6-197']
the decision will be based on the answers you give to the questions i ask.:::['10-6-198']
we'll start with dr. li. you claim the field is too reliant......on the linnaean taxonomic system.:::['10-6-199']
how do you propose to correct this?:::['10-6-200']
i believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence.:::['10-6-201']
i plan to begin there. interesting.:::['10-6-202']
dr. biely, your proposal includes some fieldwork. where might that take place?:::['10-6-204']
primarily in the pierre shale region of south dakota.:::['10-6-205']
certainly. very well. and dr. geller, when is my birthday?:::['10-6-206']
what? i... uh.:::['10-6-207']
care to venture a guess?:::['10-6-208']
may 12? that's not even kind of close.:::['10-6-209']
dr. li, how many graduate students will you need?:::['10-6-210']
half a dozen. i see. and dr. biely?:::['10-6-211']
three for excavation, and two for analysis.:::['10-6-212']
certainly. dr. geller, which 1965 shirelles hit......was later covered by:::['10-6-213']
a popular british invasion band?:::['10-6-214']
what? i need six graduate students.:::['10-6-216']
no, i'm sorry. we were looking for "baby it's you.":::['10-6-217']
"baby it's you.":::['10-6-218']
what? wait just a minute.:::['10-6-219']
none of my questions have anything to do with paleontology.:::['10-6-220']
you're right, i apologize. scratch the last question.:::['10-6-221']
spell "boscodictiasaur.":::['10-6-222']
um, i've never heard of a "boscodictiasaur.":::['10-6-223']
yeah, i just made it up. spell it.:::['10-6-224']
okay. b-o... no, it starts with a silent m.:::['10-6-225']
i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar.:::['10-6-227']
but you are a liar.:::['10-6-228']
what did i just say?:::['10-6-229', '10-16-101']
are you still here? chandler: yes.:::['10-6-230']
and i'm not just hurt, i'm insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...:::['10-6-231']
okay, hold on, let me just stop you right there, okay? first, you lied. right?:::['10-6-232']
then you lied about lying, okay?:::['10-6-233']
then you lied about lying about lying, okay?:::['10-6-234']
so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about lying...:::['10-6-235']
stop lying.:::['10-6-236']
why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?:::['10-6-237']
you wanna know why? you wanna know why?:::['10-6-238']
well, this is going well.:::['10-6-239']
here's how i know.:::['10-6-240']
if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you'd have some comments.:::['10-6-241']
all right, remember, i got paid a lot of money for this......and it only aired in japan.:::['10-6-242']
ichiban.:::['10-6-243']
ichiban, lipstick for men.:::['10-6-244']
and that's how i know you didn't watch the tape.:::['10-6-245']
he really is a chameleon.:::['10-6-246']
well, gladys, say hello to your new home.:::['10-6-247']
oh, my. wow.:::['10-6-248']
oh, she is so nice and big.:::['10-6-249']
oh, monica, where are you going to display gladys, oh, so proudly?:::['10-6-250']
i haven't really settled on a spot yet. how about right above the tv?:::['10-6-251']
that way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door.:::['10-6-252']
yeah, yeah, and you can get rid of that french poster.:::['10-6-253']
i like that poster. phoebe: really?:::['10-6-254']
it doesn't have anything coming out of it.:::['10-6-255']
or maybe there's someplace for her in your bedroom?:::['10-6-256']
oh, there's nothing above your bed. are you still here?:::['10-6-257']
oh, hi. hello.:::['10-6-258']
uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology-related questions?:::['10-6-259']
um, your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? ann-margret's pant size?:::['10-6-260']
i've come here to apologize. i think i may have let my feelings......for charlie interfere:::['10-6-261']
with the interview process.:::['10-6-262']
no. stop!:::['10-6-263']
anyway, i decided to offer you the grant.:::['10-6-264']
really? there is just, uh, one small stipulation.:::['10-6-265']
i have to break up with charlie? hey, you got one right.:::['10-6-266']
you're crazy. crazy or romantic?:::['10-6-267']
crazy.:::['10-6-268', '4-2-72']
or? get out!:::['10-6-269']
what? joey, what is this thing doing here?:::['10-6-271']
i got her from monica. she sold it to me for a very reasonable price.:::['10-6-272']
joey, we're not keeping this. but it's an original buffay.:::['10-6-273']
all right, fine. you can keep it.:::['10-6-274']
as long as you don't mind that she's haunted.:::['10-6-275']
hey, what? whoa. what?:::['10-6-276']
well, legend has it, joey, that she comes alive when you're asleep.:::['10-6-277']
she climbs out of the frame......and then drags her half-a-body:::['10-6-278']
across the floor......just looking for legs to steal.:::['10-6-279']
and then with her one good hand......she slowly reaches up......and turns your doorknob.:::['10-6-280']
get that legless witch out of here!:::['10-6-281']
hey, i sold that to joey. yeah, well, i told him it's haunted.:::['10-6-282']
two can play at this game. too late. you can't give it back.:::['10-6-283']
oh, yes, i can. no, you can't, she's yours.:::['10-6-284']
she's yours. she's yours.:::['10-6-285']
she's yours. hey.:::['10-6-286']
she's mine. she's mine.:::['10-6-287', '10-6-291']
you guys, you don't have to fight over her anymore.:::['10-6-288']
whoever doesn't get gladys, gets glynnis.:::['10-6-289']
i want gladys. she's mine.:::['10-6-290']
look, i'm sorry i didn't give them your tape.:::['10-6-292']
and i promise next time to submit you, whether i think you're right or not.:::['10-6-293']
that's not the point, chandler. the point is that you lied.:::['10-6-294']
i know. you're right. oh, what's it gonna take for you to forgive me?:::['10-6-295']
oh, excellent.:::['10-6-297', '3-5-144']
now what do you say?:::['10-6-298']
lying is wrong.:::['10-6-299']
and? and?:::['10-6-300']
i'm a pretty little girl.:::['10-6-301']
i knew it. ha, ha.:::['10-6-302']
your ex-boyfriend is insane.:::['10-6-303']
did you get the grant? no. and you wanna know why?:::['10-6-304']
because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.:::['10-6-305']
he refused me because i wouldn't give you up.:::['10-6-307']
benji isn't in love with me. i mean, he broke up with me.:::['10-6-308']
and besides, he's a very ethical man. really?:::['10-6-309']
is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review::::['10-6-310']
"who was the voice of underdog?":::['10-6-311']
i'm sure he was just joking.:::['10-6-312']
if you don't believe me, let's go talk to him.:::['10-6-313']
i'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.:::['10-6-314']
seriously? oh, i'm sorry. no, he did ask me one::::['10-6-315']
uh, "how do you spell boscodictiasaur?":::['10-6-316']
well, if it's like the lake mbosco in congo, then m-b-o...:::['10-6-317']
dr. geller. charlie, what are you doing here?:::['10-6-319']
i want you to tell her everything.:::['10-6-320']
about the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you...:::['10-6-321']
wally cox. that's the voice of underdog.:::['10-6-322']
like i tried to tell you in the interview......this grant is not based on your:::['10-6-323']
knowledge of pretty useless trivia.:::['10-6-324']
no, don't do that. i want you to look her in the eyes and tell her the truth.:::['10-6-325']
benji?:::['10-6-326']
it's true. i behaved horribly, but it's only because i still love you.:::['10-6-327']
and i would do anything to have you back in my life.:::['10-6-328']
too little, too late, benji.:::['10-6-329']
i can't believe this. i never should've broken up with you.:::['10-6-330']
i think about you all the time. do you ever still think about me?:::['10-6-331']
yes. what?:::['10-6-333']
i don't know what to say, benji. this is all so......romantic.:::['10-6-334']
i know i may be way out of bounds here......but is there any chance:::['10-6-336']
you would take me back?:::['10-6-337']
sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.:::['10-6-339']
oh, god. i am so sorry, but...:::['10-6-340']
i mean, there's so much history between us, you know?:::['10-6-341']
i love you. oh, i love you too.:::['10-6-343']
okay, that's it, we are seeing other people.:::['10-6-344']
gladys?:::['10-6-345']
for the third time this week. man, this does not get old.:::['10-6-346']
you're mean! oh, don't be such a baby. please.:::['10-6-347']
hey, you guys. phoebe: hey. what are you doing?:::['10-7-0']
figuring out our wedding plans. we were doing the same thing.:::['10-7-1']
it's really crazy. the hall, the dress, the food.:::['10-7-3']
i had no idea how expensive this stuff was. yeah, it is really pricey.:::['10-7-4']
i freaked when i heard the numbers. so, what did you two do about it?:::['10-7-5']
it was simple. i came up with some cost-cutting solutions......wrote out a list:::['10-7-6']
and monica told me to go to hell.:::['10-7-7']
there's no way around it. just accept that this is gonna cost a lot of money.:::['10-7-8']
i heard that weddings are, like, a $40 billion-a-year industry.:::['10-7-9']
yeah. and i'm responsible for just, like, half of that.:::['10-7-10']
but really, it does seem like this money could be put to better use.:::['10-7-11']
yeah. now, how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity......and we just got married at city hall?:::['10-7-13']
i think it would make me wanna marry you even more.:::['10-7-14']
well, i gotta say, you guys, that's an incredible gesture.:::['10-7-15']
maybe you do that next time you get married.:::['10-7-16']
no, no, no. the next time's gonna be hawaii at sunset.:::['10-7-17']
but maybe the time after that.:::['10-7-18']
our adoption social worker is coming by, so we're cleaning the apartment.:::['10-7-21']
"we"?:::['10-7-22']
you know you don't want me to help. you can't have it both ways.:::['10-7-23']
hey, is this the person who decides whether or not you get a baby?:::['10-7-24']
kind of. she's coming to see where we live. and it has to go perfectly.:::['10-7-25']
if she doesn't like us, she can keep us off every adoption list in the state.:::['10-7-26']
hey, maybe i should stop by. she could be a soap-opera fan.:::['10-7-27']
it's very impressive when the little people know a celebrity.:::['10-7-28']
"little people"?:::['10-7-29']
"celebrity.":::['10-7-30']
so i think i'm just about done here.:::['10-7-31']
unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?:::['10-7-32']
no. chandler.:::['10-7-34', '3-20-322']
i don't, and i'm offended by the insinuation.:::['10-7-35']
so there's not a magazine under the couch......or a pack of cigarettes:::['10-7-36']
taped to the back of the toilet tank......or a filthy video in the vcr?:::['10-7-37']
i'll admit to the cigarettes and the magazine.:::['10-7-38']
but that tape is not mine.:::['10-7-39']
it isn't mine. i guess we'll never know whose it is.:::['10-7-40']
may i help you? yes.:::['10-7-41']
we're here to make a rather sizable donation to the children.:::['10-7-42']
well, any contribution, large or small, is appreciated.:::['10-7-43']
well, i think you're gonna appreciate the crap out of this one.:::['10-7-44']
well, this is very generous. and we don't want any recognition.:::['10-7-45']
this is completely anonymous.:::['10-7-46']
completely anonymous. from two kind strangers.:::['10-7-47']
mr. x and phoebe buffay.:::['10-7-48']
we can put your names in our newsletter.:::['10-7-49']
not necessary. buffay is spelled b-u-f-f-a-y.:::['10-7-50']
and x is spelled, uh, "mike hannigan.":::['10-7-51']
all right, well, on behalf of the children, thank you both very much.:::['10-7-52']
sure. i'm glad we did this. it feels so good. it does. it feels really good.:::['10-7-53']
oh, look. and we get these free t-shirts.:::['10-7-54']
actually, that's the shirt i wore to the gym.:::['10-7-55']
it's moist.:::['10-7-56']
rachel: emma will be up in a minute. ross: oh, good.:::['10-7-57']
oh, hey, ross, listen. i heard about you and charlie. i'm really sorry.:::['10-7-58']
aw, that's okay. i'm sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there.:::['10-7-59']
absolutely. there was one. she's it.:::['10-7-60']
all the rest look like they should live under a bridge.:::['10-7-61']
so, uh, what are you gonna do today?:::['10-7-62']
well, i was thinking of taking emma to the playground.:::['10-7-63']
like i said, i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire.:::['10-7-65']
okay, look, ross. i do not want emma going to the playground.:::['10-7-66']
because?:::['10-7-67']
all right, if you must know, i had a traumatic......swing incident when i was little.:::['10-7-68']
seriously? yes. i was 4 years old.:::['10-7-69']
and i was on the swing......and then all of a sudden my hair:::['10-7-70']
got tangled in the chain.:::['10-7-71']
and to get me out, my mom had to cut a big chunk of my hair.:::['10-7-72']
and it was uneven for weeks.:::['10-7-73']
and you made it through that?:::['10-7-74']
i wonder who's gonna play you in the movie.:::['10-7-75']
okay, fine, you can make fun of me. i do not want emma going there.:::['10-7-76']
and i was thinking claire danes.:::['10-7-77']
look, i'm sorry to hear about your tragedy.:::['10-7-78']
okay? but the swings are perfectly safe. and besides, emma loves them.:::['10-7-79']
you should come, and you'll see. those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.:::['10-7-80']
and there's that moment when you're at the top......when you just don't know:::['10-7-81']
if you're gonna return back to earth.:::['10-7-82']
space is filled with orbiting children.:::['10-7-83']
look, please, just come on.:::['10-7-84']
when you see the look on emma's face, i swear, you won't regret it.:::['10-7-85']
all right. good.:::['10-7-86']
you don't wanna be a mothers... ...who pass on their irrational fears to their children, do you?:::['10-7-87']
"irrational," huh?:::['10-7-88']
i'll remember that next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment.:::['10-7-89']
oh, yeah, that's the same. i'm sure there are 30 different species of poisonous swings.:::['10-7-90']
oh, my god. the adoption lady is early.:::['10-7-91']
okay. okay. here we go. monica: okay. here we go.:::['10-7-92']
stand up straight.:::['10-7-93']
big smile.:::['10-7-94']
hello. is this the creepy residence?:::['10-7-95']
we're waiting for the adoption lady. but, hey, i'm glad you're here.:::['10-7-96']
i was cleaning this morning and i found this.:::['10-7-97']
i don't know if you wanna use it, but...:::['10-7-98']
oh, this is so sweet of you.:::['10-7-99']
oh, but i won't be needing a veil. i actually won't be wearing a dress at all.:::['10-7-100']
i told you, i am not coming to a naked wedding.:::['10-7-101']
no, no, no. we're not having a big reception.:::['10-7-102']
we took the wedding money we were gonna spend... ...and donated it to a children's charity.:::['10-7-103']
that's crazy!:::['10-7-104']
i'm sorry. i can't imagine giving up my one wedding day like that.:::['10-7-105']
yeah, well, we're different. i don't care about having a huge party.:::['10-7-106']
this is really nice for you, but...:::['10-7-107']
oh, please. i put this on and, ugh, i just look like...:::['10-7-108']
well, radiant.:::['10-7-109']
all right, but who cares? you know, i don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.:::['10-7-110']
that's right. you're making a commitment.:::['10-7-111']
and, you know, that's the same whether you do it at the plaza or...:::['10-7-112']
where you gonna do it? city hall.:::['10-7-113']
oh, that sounds nice.:::['10-7-115']
i was just there for jury duty. they've really spruced that place up.:::['10-7-116']
okay. no, it's okay. it's okay. it's okay. i've made my decision.:::['10-7-117']
what i really want is a great big wedding.:::['10-7-118']
but you gave all the money to charity. well, i'll just ask for it back.:::['10-7-120']
i don't think you can do that. monica: why not?:::['10-7-121']
this is her wedding day. that's way more important than some stupid kids.:::['10-7-122']
that's sweet, honey, but save something for the adoption lady.:::['10-7-123']
rachel: all right, okay. be careful. ross: okay.:::['10-7-124']
careful. watch her hair. watch her hair!:::['10-7-125']
rach, she's got, like, three hairs. i know. i know.:::['10-7-126']
but they're just so beautiful. oh, my god, i just pulled one out.:::['10-7-127']
i promise you she's safe, okay? watch how much she loves this.:::['10-7-128']
okay. okay. are you ready, sweetie? here we go.:::['10-7-129']
rachel: okay, careful. okay. oh.:::['10-7-130']
she's smiling.:::['10-7-131']
look at that, she does like it.:::['10-7-132']
see, i told you. oh. ah!:::['10-7-133']
oh, my god. look at her, she's a little daredevil.:::['10-7-134']
oh, god. let me push. can i push? oh, absolutely.:::['10-7-135']
okay. oh, god. okay, get the camera. it's in the diaper bag.:::['10-7-136']
see? scared of the swings. i bet you feel pretty silly. aah!:::['10-7-138']
we're seriously asking for the money back? it's for our wedding day.:::['10-7-139']
all right, now, is this guy gay or straight? because one of us has to start flirting.:::['10-7-140']
wow. you here to make another donation the same day?:::['10-7-141']
i don't think that's ever happened before.:::['10-7-142']
gay. go.:::['10-7-143']
oh, my god, i love your shirt.:::['10-7-144']
the donation we made earlier? um, well, we want it back.:::['10-7-145']
see, okay, that money was for a big wedding we thought we didn't want.:::['10-7-147']
but it turns out we do.:::['10-7-148']
so you're asking us to refund your donation to the children?:::['10-7-149']
this feels really good.:::['10-7-151']
yeah, i'm sorry. i am. but this wedding's just really important to me.:::['10-7-152']
hey, it's none of my business. besides, this is probably a good thing.:::['10-7-153']
we've really been spoiling the children, what with all the food and warm clothing.:::['10-7-154']
that's not fair. a person's wedding is important.:::['10-7-155']
and especially to me.:::['10-7-156']
okay, i didn't have a graduation party. and i didn't go to prom.:::['10-7-157']
and i spent my sweet 16 being chased around a tire yard......by an escaped mental patient who,in his own words, wanted to::::['10-7-158']
"kill me, or whatever.":::['10-7-159']
so i deserve a real celebration.:::['10-7-160']
and i'm not gonna let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it.:::['10-7-161']
she could've been talking about either one of us.:::['10-7-162']
hi, i'm laura. i'm here for your adoption interview.:::['10-7-163']
hi, i'm monica. and this is chandler.:::['10-7-164']
laura: hi. thank you. please come in.:::['10-7-165']
would you like something to drink? laura: water would be fine.:::['10-7-166']
we're so glad that you're here.:::['10-7-167']
we're really excited about getting this process started.:::['10-7-168']
because we love kids. love them to death.:::['10-7-169']
well, not actually to death. that's just a figure of speech.:::['10-7-170']
we love kids the appropriate amount......as allowed by law.:::['10-7-171']
your place is just lovely. thank you.:::['10-7-172']
yes, this building does have a wholesome, family feel to it.:::['10-7-173']
i feel like i've been here before. are any other couples in the building adopting?:::['10-7-174']
is that that couple on the first floor? because we should get a baby before them.:::['10-7-175']
that guy tried to sell me drugs.:::['10-7-176']
but other than that, wholesome, wholesome building.:::['10-7-177']
what? i just realized why i remember this place.:::['10-7-179']
really? what is it? oh, it's nothing.:::['10-7-180']
i went on a date with a guy who lived in this building. it didn't end very well.:::['10-7-181']
that wouldn't, by any chance, be joey tribbiani?:::['10-7-182']
yes! of course it was.:::['10-7-183']
we had a great night. in the morning, he promised he'd call and he didn't.:::['10-7-184']
rat bastard!:::['10-7-185']
so you're not friends with him? oh, god, no.:::['10-7-186']
no, no, no. no. nope.:::['10-7-187']
no, no, no. no, no, no. no.:::['10-7-188']
well, i'm sorry i brought it up.:::['10-7-190']
so are either one of you planning on staying at home?:::['10-7-191']
joey: hello? anybody in there order a celebrity?:::['10-7-192']
that's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here.:::['10-7-195']
he's great with kids, though.:::['10-7-196']
ross. oh, my god, are you okay? son of a bitch!:::['10-7-197']
oh, relax. i didn't say the f-word.:::['10-7-198']
ross, see, i told you! those swings are evil!:::['10-7-199']
all right. that is it. that's the last time emma is getting on one of those things for her entire life.:::['10-7-200']
no, no, no. okay, it wasn't the swing's fault. it was my fault.:::['10-7-201']
and kind of that kid's fault.:::['10-7-202']
who is still laughing. nice.:::['10-7-203']
come on. can we just get out of here before somebody else gets hurt?:::['10-7-204']
no. okay, okay. wait. i have an idea. i want you to get on the swing......and you'll see that there's:::['10-7-205']
nothing to be afraid of.:::['10-7-206']
i know what this is all about.:::['10-7-207']
you've always been jealous of my hair.:::['10-7-208']
i just think you're an adult, okay? and you should get over your silly fears.:::['10-7-209']
all right, fine. i'll do it. good.:::['10-7-210']
if you hold a spider. where? where?:::['10-7-211']
if you hold a spider.:::['10-7-212']
guys, is everything okay? it's me, joey.:::['10-7-214']
adoption!:::['10-7-215']
oh, it's just like i said, that crazy......bert, roaming the halls.:::['10-7-217']
joey: guys? keep on roaming, bert!:::['10-7-218']
we don't want any crazy today!:::['10-7-219']
joey: what's going on? we'll talk later, bert. everything's fine!:::['10-7-220']
everything doesn't sound fine.:::['10-7-221']
is he all right out there by himself?:::['10-7-222']
oh, yeah. he has a caretaker. his older brother......ernie.:::['10-7-223']
bert and ernie? you can't make this stuff up.:::['10-7-224']
you never told me about that guy and your sweet 16.:::['10-7-225']
i'm sorry about that. oh, it ended okay.:::['10-7-226']
one of my friends shot him.:::['10-7-227']
well, at least you'll get a proper wedding. you really deserve that.:::['10-7-228']
yeah, i really do. you know, i had nothing growing up.:::['10-7-229']
just like the kids i took the money from.:::['10-7-230']
no. no, no. i see where this is going. don't make me go back there.:::['10-7-231']
look, i can't have a wedding with this money now. it's tainted.:::['10-7-232']
fine, we'll give the money back.:::['10-7-233']
if that guy at the charity gives us a hard time......my friend hasn't shot anyone:::['10-7-234']
in a really long time.:::['10-7-235']
i must say this seems like a lovely environment to raise a child in.:::['10-7-236']
you are welcome to look under any of the furniture......because, believe me, you won't find:::['10-7-237']
any porn or cigarettes under there.:::['10-7-238']
before we look around, let me make sure i have everything i need up to here.:::['10-7-239']
why don't i show you the baby's room.:::['10-7-240']
what are you doing? you wouldn't let me in.:::['10-7-241']
i thought you were in trouble. well, we're not.:::['10-7-242']
but you called me "bert.":::['10-7-243']
that's our code word for danger.:::['10-7-244']
we don't have a code word. we don't?:::['10-7-245']
we really should.:::['10-7-246']
from now on, "bert" will be our code word for danger.:::['10-7-247']
monica: so that was the baby's room.:::['10-7-248']
uh, what room should we see next? any room that isn't behind this couch.:::['10-7-249']
some people don't get him, but i think he's really funny.:::['10-7-250']
i did not care for that.:::['10-7-251']
you have to get out of here.:::['10-7-252']
you slept with our social worker and never called her back.:::['10-7-253']
she is still pissed, so she can't see you.:::['10-7-254']
chandler: what? i forgot my bat.:::['10-7-256']
and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you!:::['10-7-258']
and we don't wanna buy your bat!:::['10-7-259']
bert. bert. bert. bert.:::['10-7-261']
are you friends with him? i can explain.:::['10-7-262']
all right. okay. uh...:::['10-7-264']
wow. yeah...:::['10-7-265']
you have got some nerve coming back here.:::['10-7-266']
i can't believe you never called me. excuse me?:::['10-7-267']
you probably don't even remember my name. it's joey, by the way.:::['10-7-268']
and don't bother telling me yours, because i totally remember it, lady.:::['10-7-269']
i waited weeks for you to call me.:::['10-7-270']
i gave you my number. you never called me.:::['10-7-271']
don't try to turn this around on me.:::['10-7-272']
i am not some kind of social work......that you can just......do.:::['10-7-273']
i'm pretty sure i gave you my number. really? think about it. come on.:::['10-7-274']
you're a beautiful woman. smart, funny.:::['10-7-275']
we had a really good time. huh?:::['10-7-276']
if i had your number, why wouldn't i call you?:::['10-7-277']
well, maybe i'm wrong. i'm sorry.:::['10-7-279']
hey, too late for apologies. okay? you broke my heart.:::['10-7-280']
you know how many women i had to sleep with to get over you?:::['10-7-281']
joey, wait... joey: no!:::['10-7-282']
i waited a long time! i can't wait anymore.:::['10-7-283']
i'm sorry that you had to see that. i'm so embarrassed.:::['10-7-284']
oh, that's really okay. yeah. we totally understand.:::['10-7-285']
dating is hard. boy, you people are nice.:::['10-7-286']
and i've got to say......i think you're going to make:::['10-7-287']
excellent parents.:::['10-7-288']
laura!:::['10-7-289']
we're back.:::['10-7-290']
are you here to take more money?:::['10-7-291']
because i think what you're looking for is an atm.:::['10-7-292']
no, no, we're here to give the money back.:::['10-7-293']
yeah. because you know what? it's all about the children.:::['10-7-294']
although it's also about the wedding.:::['10-7-295']
ugh. all right, here. no. oh, god.:::['10-7-296']
if i haven't said so already, sir, congratulations.:::['10-7-297']
okay, look, enough, all right?:::['10-7-298']
i'm stepping in and putting my foot down.:::['10-7-299']
as your future husband, i'm gonna make this decision for us.:::['10-7-300']
what do you think we should do?:::['10-7-301']
it's not your decision anymore. what?:::['10-7-302']
on behalf of the children of new york, i reject your money.:::['10-7-303']
but we're giving you this. and i'm giving it back to you.:::['10-7-304']
come on. consider it a contribution.:::['10-7-305']
well, this is very generous.:::['10-7-306']
please, take the check. go have a great wedding and a wonderful life together.:::['10-7-307']
sounds good to me. we can save up, come back......and make an even bigger donation.:::['10-7-308']
man: absolutely.:::['10-7-309']
and when you do, ask for brian.:::['10-7-310']
oh, is that you? no.:::['10-7-311']
oh, my god, really? i can't wait to tell chandler.:::['10-7-314']
okay. goodbye.:::['10-7-315', '4-15-303', '4-2-23']
wrong number? that was laura.:::['10-7-316']
she gave us a great report and we're officially on the waiting list.:::['10-7-317']
that's great. now we just wait for a call......and someone tells us:::['10-7-318']
there's a baby waiting for us. oh.:::['10-7-319']
have you seen joey's bat?:::['10-7-321']
okay. i got a spider.:::['10-7-322']

okay, get on the swing.:::['10-7-326']
rachel: okay.:::['10-7-327', '10-12-256', '2-22-314', '5-7-131']

you know what? i'm getting used to this little guy.:::['10-7-333']
i don't even feel him in here anymore. that's because he's on your neck.:::['10-7-334']
whoa! ross!:::['10-7-335']

wow, so tonight may be the night. you nervous?:::['10-3-2']
nah. no. this is the part i'm actually good at, ha, ha.:::['10-3-3']
what must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing?:::['10-3-4']
how can you be so confident?:::['10-3-6']
well, i know exactly what i'm gonna do.:::['10-3-7']
really? like, you have a routine? no. see, each woman is different.:::['10-3-8']
you have to appreciate their uniqueness.:::['10-3-9']
really? no, i do six things.:::['10-3-10']
first, i look deep into her eyes, then i kiss her.:::['10-3-11']
next, i take my hand and i softly graze her thigh.:::['10-3-12']
you mean like this?:::['10-3-13']
no, not like that. no, no. no, like this::::['10-3-14']

i can't believe that's sprayed on.:::['10-3-28']
i mean, it looks really good. i wonder if i should get one.:::['10-3-29']
sure, then you should get a miniskirt so you can really show it off.:::['10-3-30']
so do you get colors or just french tips?:::['10-3-31']
here. here's their card. thanks.:::['10-3-32']

and she always brags about all the famous people she's met.:::['10-3-51']
"uh, i slept with billy joel.":::['10-3-53']
all right, who hasn't?:::['10-3-54']
oh, what are we gonna do? i don't wanna see her.:::['10-3-55']
oh, let's just cut her out.:::['10-3-56']
what? cut her out of our lives.:::['10-3-57']
just ignore her calls and dodge her till she gets the point.:::['10-3-58']
well, i guess we could try that. but it seems so harsh.:::['10-3-59']
have you ever done that? no. had it done to me, though.:::['10-3-60']
feels good.:::['10-3-61']
all right, mr. geller, right this way.:::['10-3-62']

no, don't get it. let the machine pick up.:::['10-3-104']
oh, yeah, it could be rachel asking if someone could babysit again.:::['10-3-105']
it could be amanda. oh, you're right. oh.:::['10-3-106']
i was just kidding about rachel. babysitting's a gas.:::['10-3-107']

i got this uncontrollable need to please people.:::['10-3-123']
fine. fine. you would not hold up well under torture.:::['10-3-124']
oh, and you would? i did.:::['10-3-125']
rach, are you sure you wanna do this? absolutely.:::['10-3-126']
it's just a little weird. it's you, and it's me.:::['10-3-127']
it'll just take some getting used to. okay.:::['10-3-128']
okay, well, uh, how can we make it easier?:::['10-3-129']
okay. let's work from the top down.:::['10-3-130']
just work the bra, joe. okay, got it, yeah. absolutely.:::['10-3-131']
okay, ha, ha. okay.:::['10-3-132']
is this thing welded shut? ha, ha. okay.:::['10-3-133']
all right, turn around. i gotta get a look at this thing. oh.:::['10-3-134']
ow! sorry.:::['10-3-135']
well, this is romantic.:::['10-3-136']
i'm sorry. this has never happened to me before.:::['10-3-137']
i'm an expert at taking off bras. i could do it with one hand.:::['10-3-138']
i could do it with my eyes closed. once i just looked at one......and it popped open.:::['10-3-139']
i blame your bra. it's a standard-issue bra clasp.:::['10-3-140']
then i blame you. yeah. that's right. you threw me off with all your slapping.:::['10-3-141']
okay, look, i'm really sorry about that, joey.:::['10-3-142']
but do you think maybe, on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?:::['10-3-143']
no, i don't have another level.:::['10-3-144']
hold on. there's something different.:::['10-3-145']
i went to that tanning place your wife suggested.:::['10-3-146']
was that place the sun?:::['10-3-147']
oh, and it gets worse.:::['10-3-148']
oh, my god, you can do a duet of "ebony and lvory" all by yourself.:::['10-3-149']
how could you mess this up? it's so easy.:::['10-3-150']
you go in the booth, count to five and turn around.:::['10-3-151']
how do you count to five? one, two, three...:::['10-3-152']
i know! ha-ha-ha.:::['10-3-154']
oh, what is up with miss hawaiian tropic?:::['10-3-155']
how was your date with joey?:::['10-3-156']
well, it was good, until we got back to our apartment.:::['10-3-157']
and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg......and i kept slapping it away.:::['10-3-158']
you didn't like that?:::['10-3-159']
well, it wasn't just me, all right? he freaked out too.:::['10-3-160']
he couldn't even undo my bra.:::['10-3-161']
wow, really? one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.:::['10-3-162']
i do not know what's wrong with us.:::['10-3-163']
we've kissed before and that's been great.:::['10-3-164']
but this time it was leading somewhere......and i was very aware of the fact:::['10-3-165']
that it was joey touching me.:::['10-3-166']
you guys have been friends forever.:::['10-3-167']
the first time you kissed ross was weird.:::['10-3-168']
mm-hm. you couldn't stop laughing. you got through that. mm-hm.:::['10-3-169']
okay. that's true. that's true, we can do this.:::['10-3-170']
you're right. we can do this. we'll just power through.:::['10-3-171']
hey, uh, chandler, can i talk to you for a second?:::['10-3-172']
no need, problem solved. we are powering through.:::['10-3-173']
chandler, stop. it's not going to pop open.:::['10-3-174']
you don't know.:::['10-3-175', '5-11-287']
hi, phoebe. hey.:::['10-3-176']
is amanda here yet? no.:::['10-3-177']
i'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting her out" plan, but i have a new plan.:::['10-3-178']
chandler will call in a few minutes with an emergency.:::['10-3-179']
oh, okay, what kind of emergency gets us both out of here?:::['10-3-180']
what do you think of mike and chandler being in a car accident?:::['10-3-181']
are you kidding? i love it. okay.:::['10-3-182']
amanda: hi. ha, ha. phoebe: hi.:::['10-3-183']
it's so nice to see you. ha, ha.:::['10-3-185']
both of you, look at me. look how young i look.:::['10-3-186']
oh, gosh, we have so much to catch up on.:::['10-3-187']
but first things first. touch my abs. i don't exercise at all.:::['10-3-188']
oh, gosh. so, monica, you're married.:::['10-3-189']
yeah, his name is chandler and he's... oh, smell my neck.:::['10-3-190']
it's not perfume. it's me. it's my natural scent.:::['10-3-191']
musty. oh.:::['10-3-192']
gosh, this is brilliant. gosh, it's just like old times.:::['10-3-193']
i'm so happy you two are friends again.:::['10-3-194']
when were we not friends? well, it was 1992.:::['10-3-195']
and i remember, because that was the year i had sex with evel knievel. ha, ha.:::['10-3-196']
uh, we were friends in 1992.:::['10-3-197']
no, i distinctly remember you were dodging her calls......and trying to avoid seeing her.:::['10-3-198']
you were going to cut me out? well, kind of.:::['10-3-199']
oh, my god. oh, bugger.:::['10-3-200']
should i not have said that? unh! i feel like a perfect arse.:::['10-3-201']
well, in america, you're just an ass.:::['10-3-202']
chandler, what's wrong?:::['10-3-204']
oh, my god, are you all right? yeah, i'll be right there.:::['10-3-205']
oh, i'm so sorry, but chandler was in a car accident.:::['10-3-206']
oh, my god. yeah.:::['10-3-207']
was mike with him? nope.:::['10-3-208']
got the champagne? yes. ready to power through.:::['10-3-210']
excellent. put it on ice, the phone is off the hook......and, in the interest:::['10-3-211']
of powering through...:::['10-3-212']
okay, sexy, sexy.:::['10-3-213']
very sexy, sexy.:::['10-3-214']
all right, let's do it. okay, you're scaring me a little bit.:::['10-3-215']
oh, get over it, soldier, we gotta do this. okay.:::['10-3-216']
okay. ha, ha, you like that, huh? oh, yeah.:::['10-3-217']
you like that? let's kick this into high gear, huh?:::['10-3-218']
yeah, baby. i'll show you how we do it.:::['10-3-220']
you kneed me in my misters.:::['10-3-222']
what? oh, my god. i'm so sorry.:::['10-3-223']
joey? are you okay?:::['10-3-224']
soldier down.:::['10-3-225']
we are not friends with phoebe anymore.:::['10-3-226']
if she asks, i protested a little, but okay.:::['10-3-227']
oh, chandler, thank god you're alive. monica, can i talk to you outside?:::['10-3-228']
i have nothing to say to you. wow. my flat is twice this size.:::['10-3-229']
please, monica, in the hall?:::['10-3-230']
ooh, that accident must have been terrible.:::['10-3-231']
you look positively ghastly.:::['10-3-232']
well, aren't you a treat.:::['10-3-233']
i can't believe you tried to cut me out. why, phoebe? why?:::['10-3-234']
it was right after we were living together......and you were driving me crazy,okay?:::['10-3-235']
you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.:::['10-3-236']
well, i'm still all those things.:::['10-3-237']
you're also so generous and kind and scrappy.:::['10-3-238']
i am scrappy.:::['10-3-239']
exactly. no matter what i tried to do, i couldn't keep you out of my life.:::['10-3-240']
of all the people i've cut out......you were the only one:::['10-3-241']
who ever clawed her way back in.:::['10-3-242']
that's because i'm scrappy.:::['10-3-243']
yeah, you are, and i'm so glad that you fought your way back in......because i don't know what:::['10-3-244']
i would do without you.:::['10-3-245']
i don't know what i would do without you.:::['10-3-246']
well, i guess we should go back in. i mean, you gave me another chance.:::['10-3-248']
we should do the same for amanda. yeah, i guess you're right.:::['10-3-249']
can you believe it? i've never had any professional dance training.:::['10-3-250']
let me explain how this works. go in the booth and...:::['10-3-251']
i'm gonna stop you right there, glenda. okay? ha, ha.:::['10-3-252']
does it look like this is my first time, huh?:::['10-3-253']
now, i want four two's, and i want them all on my back.:::['10-3-254']
wait. there's two sets of nozzles. which one is it? which one is it?:::['10-3-256']
oh, son of a bitch!:::['10-3-257']
what is the matter with us?:::['10-3-258']
well, i know what's the matter with me.:::['10-3-259']
no, i mean with us, you know? i mean, is it supposed to be this......difficult?:::['10-3-260']
that fake british woman's a real bitch, but she sure can dance.:::['10-3-262']
hey, listen, can i ask you a question? when you and monica first hooked up......was it weird going from friends:::['10-3-264']
to more than that?:::['10-3-265']
kind of. sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...:::['10-3-266']
no, no, no. no, i mean......sexually.:::['10-3-267']
yeah, uh, was there a part of you that felt like it was......really wrong?:::['10-3-268']
actually, no. no, it felt right, you know?:::['10-3-269']
if felt like, uh: "i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.":::['10-3-270']
i can tell from your expressions that's the good news you were hoping for.:::['10-3-271']
well, i'm gonna go continue to spread the joy.:::['10-3-272']
just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to for us.:::['10-3-273']
yeah. yeah, absolutely.:::['10-3-274']
i mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.:::['10-3-275']
right, totally. yeah. and so......we'll just keep trying:::['10-3-276']
and trying until we do it.:::['10-3-277']
if not, we'll just be a couple that never has sex.:::['10-3-278']
that's a plan.:::['10-3-279']
i did not see this coming. i know.:::['10-3-280']
i don't know, i don't get it. i mean, i was so sure this is what i wanted.:::['10-3-281']
well, how come monica and chandler could do it?:::['10-3-284']
i guess they weren't as good friends as we are.:::['10-3-285']
i bet you're right. hmm.:::['10-3-287']
love you too.:::['10-3-291']
all right, i'm going to bed. yeah, me too.:::['10-3-292']
yeah. i'm not going anywhere for a while.:::['10-3-293']
chandler: it's chandler. let me in. go away.:::['10-3-294']
i don't wanna see anybody.:::['10-3-295']
chandler: i went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me.:::['10-3-296']
let me in. really?:::['10-3-297']
did you count mississippi-ly?:::['10-3-298']
you're not tan.:::['10-3-299']
no. i just had to get a picture of this. i'll see you later.:::['10-3-300']
joey: uh, okay, ross.:::['10-2-0']
i realize that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but, uh...:::['10-2-1']
let me explain, okay? we weren't doing anything!:::['10-2-2']
rach, he just saw us.:::['10-2-3']
uh, but what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? one kiss.:::['10-2-5']
that's a lie! we also kissed in barbados. dude, chill!:::['10-2-6']
okay, we also kissed in barbados......but we didn't plan it.:::['10-2-7']
the only reason that happened......was because i saw you kiss charlie.:::['10-2-8']
yeah, you started it! i have got to chill.:::['10-2-9']
look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened.:::['10-2-10']
but... oh, we feel so terrible about this, ross.:::['10-2-11']
yeah. but it did happen.:::['10-2-12']
can we just close the door?:::['10-2-15']
ross, say something.:::['10-2-16']
anything.:::['10-2-17']
so you two are?:::['10-2-18']
and have you had?:::['10-2-20']
no. no, no, no. no. no.:::['10-2-21']
but if i hadn't walked in here, would you?:::['10-2-22']
probably... no. no.:::['10-2-23']
ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this.:::['10-2-24']
you have every right to go nuts.:::['10-2-25']
i'm not going nuts. do you see me going nuts?:::['10-2-26']
no, but you know what i mean.:::['10-2-27']
hey, hey, hey.:::['10-2-28', '3-10-115']
if you two are happy......then i'm happy for you.:::['10-2-29']
totally fine.:::['10-2-33']
heh. i don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky......because, really......i'm fine.:::['10-2-34']
i wasn't a little surprised......heh, to see you guys kissing.:::['10-2-35']
i mean, at first i was like::::['10-2-36']
but now that i've had time to absorb it...:::['10-2-37']
loving this.:::['10-2-38']
ross... it's all working out.:::['10-2-39']
me and charlie. and you two.:::['10-2-40']
you know what we should do? calm ourselves?:::['10-2-41']
we should all have dinner.:::['10-2-43']
yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. i'll cook!:::['10-2-44']
wow. uh, look, don't you think that would be a little weird?:::['10-2-45']
weird? what? what's weird? huh?:::['10-2-46']
the only thing weird would be if someone didn't like mexican food......because i'm making fajitas!:::['10-2-47']
i do like fajitas.:::['10-2-48']
god, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming.:::['10-2-49']
there's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.:::['10-2-50']
there's so many ways to go, and this is, like, the biggest decision of our lives.:::['10-2-51']
there's a hair in my coffee.:::['10-2-52']
hey, guys. monica: hey.:::['10-2-53']
have you seen frank jr? he's meeting me here with the triplets.:::['10-2-54']
it's funny, every time you say "triplets"......i think of three hot,blond 19-year-olds.:::['10-2-55']
oh, that's sweet.:::['10-2-56']
drink your hair.:::['10-2-57']
hey, what's all this stuff?:::['10-2-58']
oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.:::['10-2-59']
ooh, babies! oh, this one is so cute.:::['10-2-60']
get this one.:::['10-2-61']
that's not really how it works.:::['10-2-62']
oh, how does it work? i don't know!:::['10-2-63']
if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends......bill and colleen. they adopted:::['10-2-64']
a kid. i'm sure they'd help you.:::['10-2-65']
monica: thanks, that would be great. sure.:::['10-2-66']
hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?:::['10-2-67']
all right, all right. remember what we talked about.:::['10-2-68']
when we're in a public place, there are certain rules.:::['10-2-69']
that's not what we talked about!:::['10-2-70']
hi, frank. hi.:::['10-2-71']
good to see you. good to see you too.:::['10-2-72']
monica: hi, frank. hi. hey, how you doing?:::['10-2-73']
oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big. which one is which again?:::['10-2-74']
oh, well, uh, uh, that's, uh, frank jr. jr......pulling the tampons out:::['10-2-75']
of the lady's purse.:::['10-2-76']
and, uh, that's, uh, chandler climbing on chandler.:::['10-2-77']
and, uh, that's leslie throwing bagels at him.:::['10-2-78']
"willing to adopt triplets?" no.:::['10-2-79']
oh, can i just say, i know we're doing this for ross and that's cool.:::['10-2-80']
but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.:::['10-2-81']
well, what would we be doing?:::['10-2-82']
i'd take you out for a romantic night.:::['10-2-83']
some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home.:::['10-2-84']
feel me up?:::['10-2-85']
in a carriage.:::['10-2-86']
hey, charlie! hi.:::['10-2-87']
rachel: hi. charlie: hey. hmm.:::['10-2-88']

oh, you bet.:::['10-2-90']
charlie: mm. joey: mm-hm.:::['10-2-91']
so did you, uh, bring a little something for ross?:::['10-2-92']
actually, uh, it's some stuff you left at my apartment.:::['10-2-93']
oh, well, thanks.:::['10-2-94']
and you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.:::['10-2-95']
yeah, i didn't throw any of that out. heh, heh.:::['10-2-96']
ah, i thought i heard voices. what? ha, ha.:::['10-2-97']
hi, charlie. mwah.:::['10-2-98']

okay. uh, well, we brought you some wine.:::['10-2-103']
oh. ah. that is so thoughtful.:::['10-2-104']

and what did you bring me, huh? uh, actually, that's, uh...:::['10-2-106']
underwear, a toothbrush......and a van halen cd.:::['10-2-107']
i can use all these things!:::['10-2-108']
gosh, ross, you know, you seem a little, um...:::['10-2-109']
what? fine? because i am, huh?:::['10-2-110']
aren't you? aren't you? aren't...? you see?:::['10-2-111']
who else is fine?:::['10-2-112']
joey: ha, ha. come on.:::['10-2-113']
listen. why don't you, uh, try to relax. maybe have a drink.:::['10-2-114']
you know what, that is a very good idea.:::['10-2-115']
i'm gonna go make a pitcher of margaritas.:::['10-2-116']
so adorable.:::['10-2-118']
look at them, sleeping there like angels.:::['10-2-119']
yeah, i really cherish these moments... phoebe: mm.:::['10-2-120']
...because, uh, before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.:::['10-2-121']
well, they may be a handful......but they're so cute.:::['10-2-122']
oh, god, last time i babysat them, they did the funniest thing. ha, ha.:::['10-2-124']
i haven't slept in four years.:::['10-2-125']
that's a long time.:::['10-2-126']
frank: you just don't know how hard it is, phoebe.:::['10-2-127']
there's just so many of them.:::['10-2-128']
you know, two i could handle.:::['10-2-129']
two's great. you just hold one in each hand.:::['10-2-130']
what do i do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on?:::['10-2-131']
i got no more hands to protect my area.:::['10-2-132']
there's three of them, phoebe. three.:::['10-2-133']
yeah, i know, frank.:::['10-2-134']
i counted them when they were coming out of my area.:::['10-2-135']
sometimes, i think that, uh...:::['10-2-136']
oh, no, no, no, i can't say it. it's too horrible. no.:::['10-2-137']
frank: no, no, i can't.:::['10-2-139']
oh, my god, frank. are you thinking of leaving?:::['10-2-140']
because i didn't have those triplets so you could run out on them.:::['10-2-141']
oh, no, i would never do that. no. i just......was thinking that, you know,maybe you could take one.:::['10-2-142']
you can't separate them, that's terrible! which one?:::['10-2-144']
thank you so much for seeing us.:::['10-2-145']
phoebe has told us great things about you guys.:::['10-2-146']
oh, please, we're happy to help.:::['10-2-147']
we went through the same thing when we were adopting.:::['10-2-148']
so a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?:::['10-2-149']
i mean, you have a lovely home.:::['10-2-150']
we appreciate anything you can tell us.:::['10-2-151']
well, actually, i think this might help.:::['10-2-152']
it's pretty much......all the information you need.:::['10-2-153']
everything is broken into categories, then cross-referenced.:::['10-2-155']
then color-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.:::['10-2-156']
i think i just had a tiny orgasm.:::['10-2-158']
i know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it.:::['10-2-159']
adopting owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.:::['10-2-160']
that's great. can i see the book?:::['10-2-161']
you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?:::['10-2-162']
please. it's just so pretty and white.:::['10-2-163']
bathroom is down the hall to your left.:::['10-2-164']
i would have told him to do it too.:::['10-2-165']
can i adopt you?:::['10-2-166']
hey, you must be owen. yeah.:::['10-2-167']
i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too.:::['10-2-168']
you were? in fact, my father was a den mother.:::['10-2-169']
huh? you know how to use a compass?:::['10-2-170']
i have a badge in it.:::['10-2-171']
you do? that's fantastic. you want to see it?:::['10-2-172']
i'd love to, but i gotta get back to your parents.:::['10-2-173']
they're telling us about how they adopted you.:::['10-2-174']
i'm adopted?:::['10-2-177']
margaritas was not so great......but this second batch is good.:::['10-2-179']
well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.:::['10-2-180']
oh, god, this is fun, isn't it?:::['10-2-181']
you know, just the four of us.:::['10-2-182']
just hanging. ha.:::['10-2-183']
dude, are you okay?:::['10-2-184']
and when are the fajitas gonna be ready?:::['10-2-185']
i'm fine, okay? i'm great.:::['10-2-186']
i'm just... i'm just proud of us.:::['10-2-187']
you know? there's no weirdness, no tension.:::['10-2-188']
no awareness.:::['10-2-189']
we make a great foursome. we should do more stuff together.:::['10-2-190']
you know, oh, let's take a trip!:::['10-2-191']
okay, where do you think we can go?:::['10-2-192']
my fajitas!:::['10-2-193']
look, charlie, i just want you to know......ross is just having a little trouble:::['10-2-194']
adjusting to the thought of joey and me.:::['10-2-195']
he normally doesn't drink like this.:::['10-2-196']
oh, you know what, this is nothing. my father is a raging alcoholic.:::['10-2-197']
oh, i'm sorry, have i made this evening uncomfortable?:::['10-2-198']
fajitas! be careful! very hot plate! very hot!:::['10-2-199']
ross, you don't even have oven mitts on.:::['10-2-200']
that is gonna hurt tomorrow.:::['10-2-201']
okay, well, this is crazy.:::['10-2-202']
we can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?:::['10-2-203']
oh, no, of course we're not.:::['10-2-204']
phoebe: that's insane. i know.:::['10-2-205']
alice would never go for it.:::['10-2-206']
she's pretty tired too. i think we could get her on board.:::['10-2-207']
well, just for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically......which one:::['10-2-208']
would you be willing to give up?:::['10-2-209']
frank: huh.:::['10-2-210']
frank jr. jr?:::['10-2-211']
you'd be getting a really good one.:::['10-2-212']
i mean, you know, he's really funny.:::['10-2-213']
like, the other day, he made up this joke::::['10-2-214']
what's green and says, "hey, i'm a frog"?:::['10-2-215']
a talking frog.:::['10-2-216']
oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny. ha, ha.:::['10-2-217']
well, all right, that's fine. what about, um, leslie?:::['10-2-218']
oh, no, no, not leslie. no.:::['10-2-219']
she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.:::['10-2-220']
all right, so that leaves chandler.:::['10-2-221']
oh, no, no, you can't have chandler. no, no. she's my little genius.:::['10-2-222']
i got big hopes for her.:::['10-2-223']
she's gonna be a doctor or a realtor.:::['10-2-224']
wow, frank. ha. i think we just ran out of kids.:::['10-2-225']
oh, i think you're right.:::['10-2-226']
oh, wow. phoebe, i don't think i can give one of them up.:::['10-2-227']
i mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.:::['10-2-228']
i'm sorry, frank, i didn't realize things were so bad.:::['10-2-229']
you know, i'll help out more. i can babysit anytime you want.:::['10-2-230']
you name the day and i'll be there.:::['10-2-231']
how about tomorrow? well, that's not good.:::['10-2-232']
but i can move some stuff around and i'll be there.:::['10-2-233']
you and alice just take the whole day together.:::['10-2-234']
tsk. you'd do that for us?:::['10-2-235']
are you kidding? that's what sisters are for.:::['10-2-236']
tsk. oh.:::['10-2-237']
oh, look at them.:::['10-2-238']
oh. i love you so much.:::['10-2-239']
oh, crap, don't wake up! don't wake up!:::['10-2-240']
where are bill and colleen? kitchen, getting something to eat.:::['10-2-241']
can you believe how nice they are? we have to leave.:::['10-2-242']
why? what did you do in the bathroom?:::['10-2-243']
i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way.:::['10-2-244']
he didn't know he was adopted. there's a slight chance......i may have told him.:::['10-2-245']
oh, my god, where's my purse? no, i can replace everything in there.:::['10-2-246']
get that binder and let's go! hi. ha.:::['10-2-247']
some little snacks for everybody.:::['10-2-248']
you don't have to eat the sour worms. those are for owen.:::['10-2-249']
colleen: i'll get him in a second.:::['10-2-250']
uh, by the way, you should know, we haven't told him he's adopted yet.:::['10-2-251']
but kids are so intuitive.:::['10-2-252']
don't you think, on some level, he already knows?:::['10-2-253']
i'm adopted? see? intuitive.:::['10-2-254']
what? where did you hear that?:::['10-2-255']
he told me.:::['10-2-256']
and he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.:::['10-2-257']
which, technically, now you should give back.:::['10-2-258']
you told him he's adopted?:::['10-2-259']
i'm sorry. you should have a sign out there or something.:::['10-2-260']
or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door.:::['10-2-261']
"owen doesn't know he's adopted... ...and he also thinks santa is real.":::['10-2-262']
he isn't?:::['10-2-263']
we have to get out of here, baby.:::['10-2-264']
everyone, i would like to make a toast......to rachel and joey.:::['10-2-265']
and to love.:::['10-2-266']
ah, love!:::['10-2-267']
rachel: mm.:::['10-2-268', '4-21-176']
l-o-v-e. love.:::['10-2-269']
l is for "life.":::['10-2-270']
and what is life without love?:::['10-2-271']
oh, my god, are we supposed to answer?:::['10-2-272']
o is for::::['10-2-273']
"oh, wow!":::['10-2-274']
the v is for this......very surprising turn of events......which i am still fine with,by the way.:::['10-2-275']
e… e......is for how......extremely normal i find it......that you two......are together.:::['10-2-276']
and that one day you might get married......and have children of your own.:::['10-2-277']
dude, are you okay? totally.:::['10-2-278']
ross, you don't seem okay.:::['10-2-279']
i'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining.:::['10-2-280']
i think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.:::['10-2-281']
wait, ross. ross, i, um... i have to take off.:::['10-2-282']
no! charlie: i'm sorry.:::['10-2-283']
i have an early class in the morning.:::['10-2-284']
but this has been lovely.:::['10-2-285']
wasn't it? and you thought it would be awkward with joey.:::['10-2-286']
and that you never really liked rachel.:::['10-2-287']
you are on fire! i'll call you in the morning, okay?:::['10-2-288']
rachel, what ross just said, that's just...:::['10-2-290']
oh, that's okay. girls tend not to like me.:::['10-2-291']
okay. i guess it's just flan for three.:::['10-2-293']
hey, that rhymes.:::['10-2-295']
you know what, ross, i think, uh, we're gonna take off too.:::['10-2-296']
oh, oh. heh. of course. god, i'm so stupid.:::['10-2-297']
you guys are a couple now.:::['10-2-298']
i mean, you probably just want to be alone.:::['10-2-299']
no, it's just getting late... it's fine. it's totally fine.:::['10-2-300']
i've got plenty of margaritas. it's all good.:::['10-2-301']
i don't even know what that's for.:::['10-2-302']
i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.:::['10-2-304']
that's probably a good idea. i'll see you in the morning.:::['10-2-305']
rachel: uh-huh. okay. all right.:::['10-2-306']
yeah, you know, joey, i...:::['10-2-307']
i don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.:::['10-2-308']
joey: it doesn't look good, does it? mm-mm.:::['10-2-309']
joey: morning.:::['10-2-310']
did you stay here all night? yeah.:::['10-2-312']
so you took off my pants and shoes?:::['10-2-313']
you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago soundtrack.:::['10-2-315']
ahem. look, uh, ross......about rachel and i. listen, you don't:::['10-2-316']
have to worry about that......because nothing's gonna happen.:::['10-2-317']
she and i said from the beginning......we weren't gonna do anything:::['10-2-319']
unless you were okay with it.:::['10-2-320']
and clearly...:::['10-2-321']
what are you talking about? i'm fine.:::['10-2-322']
it's okay, ross. you know, i totally understand.:::['10-2-323']
of course you're not fine. you're...:::['10-2-324']
you're ross and rachel.:::['10-2-325']
yeah, except we're not.:::['10-2-326']
i mean, we haven't been a couple in, like......six years.:::['10-2-327']
my god, is that right?:::['10-2-328']
has it been that long?:::['10-2-329']
that's what i hear, yeah.:::['10-2-330']
this is crazy. i mean, six years......and because of me,you guys aren't gonna be together?:::['10-2-331']
can i ask you something?:::['10-2-332', '3-24-95']
really......what is this thing:::['10-2-333']
with you and rachel?:::['10-2-334']
come on, you know me. ha, ha. you know...:::['10-2-335']
i'm crazy about her.:::['10-2-337']
and she feels the same way?:::['10-2-338']
i think so.:::['10-2-339', '5-7-80', '4-3-306', '3-1-329', '3-6-249']
well, then......maybe it's time:::['10-2-340']
we all moved on.:::['10-2-341']
yeah, but, ross, i mean, you're not okay with it, so...:::['10-2-342']
no, but i want to be.:::['10-2-343']
and hey::::['10-2-344']
i will be.:::['10-2-345']
besides, i'm with charlie, right?:::['10-2-346']
oh, my god, i'm still with charlie, aren't i?:::['10-2-347']
she didn't see the dance, did she? no, no, no.:::['10-2-348']
no, that was, uh... that was just for me.:::['10-2-349']
hey, you, uh?:::['10-2-350']
you sure about this?:::['10-2-351']
and......we're okay?:::['10-2-353']
um, we just want to give you a heads up.:::['10-2-355']
bill and colleen hate us.:::['10-2-356']
owen didn't know he's adopted and monica told him.:::['10-2-357']
still, he had to find out sometime.:::['10-2-359']
how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?:::['10-2-360']
i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident.:::['10-2-361']
the way you crushed mike at ping-pong was such a turn-on. you wanna?:::['10-1-1']
you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired.:::['10-1-2']
i'll put a pillowcase over my head. you're on.:::['10-1-3']
well, mike's taking a shower, which, by the way, there's no law against.:::['10-1-5']
and, um, then we're gonna grab some food. so if you want...:::['10-1-6']
ross: finally. is that ross?:::['10-1-7']
yeah. you can hear everything through these stupid walls.:::['10-1-8']
sounds like he's with someone. he could be alone.:::['10-1-9']
this morning i heard him do pushups and then talk to his triceps.:::['10-1-10']
wait a minute, i think phoebe's right.:::['10-1-11']
yeah, i hear someone else in there with him.:::['10-1-12']
dr. geller! god, you're amazing.:::['10-1-14']
i didn't even have to ask you to call me that.:::['10-1-15']
oh, my god, that's charlie! she's cheating on joey with ross!:::['10-1-16']
oh, that tart! floozy! giant!:::['10-1-17']
i'm not sure about this. yeah, you're right.:::['10-1-18']
this is none of our business.:::['10-1-19']
i'm not sure it's the best way to hear everything. get me a glass!:::['10-1-20']
no, i'm not gonna do this, okay? i'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.:::['10-1-21']
rachel: ha, ha. i love barbados.:::['10-1-22']
i can't believe i'm kissing you. ha, ha. i'm kissing rachel! ha, ha.:::['10-1-23']
i know. i'm her. ha, ha. oh!:::['10-1-24']
rachel and joey! it's rachel and joey!:::['10-1-25']
what? get over here!:::['10-1-26']
rachel: oh. whoa!:::['10-1-27']
oh, my god! i love how thin these walls are!:::['10-1-28']
hey, before, you said that nothing could happen between us. what changed?:::['10-1-30']
well, i only said that because of ross. mm.:::['10-1-31']
and then i saw him kissing charlie. what?:::['10-1-32']
ross and charlie?:::['10-1-33']
wow! she's really making her way through the group, huh?:::['10-1-34']
ah, who am i to talk? ha, ha. yeah.:::['10-1-35']
i can't believe this. rachel and joey?:::['10-1-36']
how about the dinosaur twins in the other room?:::['10-1-37']
no one is manning that wall! i'm on it!:::['10-1-38']
anything? i think i hear curtains closing.:::['10-1-39']
we've got shoes being kicked off over here.:::['10-1-40']
bedsprings! unmistakable!:::['10-1-41']
you realize that's your brother. not until you said it. somebody switch!:::['10-1-42']
wow! wait a minute.:::['10-1-43']
ross and charlie. joey and rachel.:::['10-1-44']
phoebe and mike. we're the only ones leaving with the person we came with!:::['10-1-45']
that's not true. i came with monica, i'm leaving with weird al.:::['10-1-46']
okay, i've had it with the hair jokes.:::['10-1-47']
tomorrow i'm going to the salon. okay, buckwheat.:::['10-1-48']
you gotta hear this, it's great! it's like free porn.:::['10-1-49']
is everything okay? it's just... i don't think i can do this.:::['10-1-51']
oh, is it because of what might be on the bed?:::['10-1-52']
i saw that report, with the infrared... no! no.:::['10-1-53']
no, uh...:::['10-1-54']
look, i need to talk to joey. i mean, you guys just broke up.:::['10-1-55']
before anything more happens between us, i need to know he's okay with it.:::['10-1-56']
i, uh, completely understand. all right, i'm gonna go find him.:::['10-1-57']
i just need a second before i can, you know...:::['10-1-58']
grandma, grandma, grandma.:::['10-1-59']
okay, i'll see you later. okay!:::['10-1-60']
that's the door. he's gone.:::['10-1-61']
and she's turning on the tv......and watching miss congeniality.:::['10-1-62']
honey? if you know it through a wall, you know it too well.:::['10-1-63']
oh, we're just... we're sad to go, so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel.:::['10-1-65']
i love you......paradise hotel golf resort and spa.:::['10-1-66']
yeah. we had a great time, thank you.:::['10-1-67']
okay. um, hey, have you guys seen joey anywhere?:::['10-1-69']
he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend, charlie.:::['10-1-70']
that's the situation as we know it.:::['10-1-71']
if you see him, could you tell him i'm looking for him?:::['10-1-72']
you got it. thanks.:::['10-1-73']
other wall, people! other wall!:::['10-1-75']
ross: rach, you there? oh, my god, that's ross!:::['10-1-76']
what are we gonna do? okay, just be calm.:::['10-1-77']
for all he knows, we're just hanging out.:::['10-1-78']
all right? so just be nonchalant.:::['10-1-79']
that's not nonchalant! no idea what it means.:::['10-1-80']
okay, just hide.:::['10-1-81']
ross: rach? coming! try under the bed.:::['10-1-82']
there's no room under the bed...:::['10-1-83']
ross: is everything okay? yeah.:::['10-1-84']
hey. do you know where joey is? hi.:::['10-1-85']
i really don't.:::['10-1-86', '10-14-225']
can i talk to you for a minute? yeah. sure.:::['10-1-87']
i don't believe this.:::['10-1-88', '5-22-220', '3-21-294']
have you guys been...? shh! this is the listening side of the wall.:::['10-1-89']
then she told me that she and joey had broken up......and part of the reason:::['10-1-90']
was she had feelings for me.:::['10-1-91']
uh-huh, right. yeah.:::['10-1-92']
you know i've wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her.:::['10-1-93']
oh, i know, i know. that's been really hard for you.:::['10-1-94']
anyway, one thing led to another, and......oh, before you know it, we were kissing.:::['10-1-95']
how angry do you think joey's gonna be?:::['10-1-96']
that is hard to say, ross. that is hard to say.:::['10-1-97']
i gotta find him. he's gotta be here someplace.:::['10-1-98']
you would think.:::['10-1-99', '3-10-161']
joey: is he gone? how are you doing this?:::['10-1-101']
psst!:::['10-1-102']
what? hey!:::['10-1-103']
what are you...? what is this? have you been listening this entire time?:::['10-1-104']
all: yeah!:::['10-1-105']
now, what is this?:::['10-1-106']
what is this? well, let's see. we kissed for 10 minutes......and now we're talking to our friends:::['10-1-107']
about it, so i guess this is sixth grade.:::['10-1-108']
no, no. have you thought about how complicated this could get?:::['10-1-109']
what about ross? well, he's with charlie now.:::['10-1-110']
yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her.:::['10-1-111']
and as his friend, i mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?:::['10-1-112']
you're a pain in my ass, geller.:::['10-1-113']
look, we appreciate all the advice......but this is between joey and me.:::['10-1-114']
we can handle it.:::['10-1-115']
we'll go. will you do one thing for us, the people that care about you?:::['10-1-116']
sure. enunciate.:::['10-1-117']
are they right?:::['10-1-119']
probably, yeah. i mean, maybe we should......hold off until we talk to ross.:::['10-1-120']
yeah. yeah. we can wait. we don't have to do anything tonight.:::['10-1-121']
yeah, i think that would be best.:::['10-1-122']
so, i'm gonna... i'm gonna take off.:::['10-1-123']
although... i like "although.":::['10-1-124']
uh... i mean, you know...:::['10-1-125']
ross and i haven't dated in, like......six years.:::['10-1-126']
six years?:::['10-1-127']
wow. that's almost as long as high school.:::['10-1-128']
plus, you know, he is with charlie now.:::['10-1-129']
he's not thinking about you. no.:::['10-1-131']
i'm thinking about you.:::['10-1-132']
let's forget about ross. it's forgotten.:::['10-1-134']
what's wrong? nothing.:::['10-1-135']
seriously, what is it?:::['10-1-136']
nothing. it's really... it's nothing. come here. come here.:::['10-1-137']
ah. sorry, i just, um...:::['10-1-139']
i can't seem to get ross out of my head.:::['10-1-140']
well, maybe i can help.:::['10-1-141']
your lips are so soft. do that again.:::['10-1-142']
yeah, we need to talk to ross. yeah. yeah.:::['10-1-143']
hey. you guys ready to go? hey.:::['10-1-144']
not quite. monica's at the salon, and i'm finishing packing.:::['10-1-145']
dude, you're not taking your bible?:::['10-1-146']
you're not supposed to take that.:::['10-1-147']
besides, it's a new testament. what are you gonna do with it?:::['10-1-148']
learn about jesus.:::['10-1-149']
hey! so did you talk to joey?:::['10-1-150']
uh, no. i couldn't find him. i'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.:::['10-1-151']
okay. sounds like a good idea, dr. geller.:::['10-1-152']
ph.d.:::['10-1-154']
you're filthy.:::['10-1-155']
hey. have you guys seen monica? uh, actually, i think she went to the salon.:::['10-1-156']
oh, yeah. oh, she went to the salon, all right.:::['10-1-157']

whose day just got better?:::['10-1-159']
chandler!:::['10-1-160', '10-10-255']
hey! aah.:::['10-1-161']

i think i can see your scalp. ha, ha.:::['10-1-163']
don't you just love it?:::['10-1-164']
yeah. yeah, you got shellfish in your head.:::['10-1-165']
it's, uh, something. you go, girlfriend.:::['10-1-166']
you never said that in your life. not once.:::['10-1-167']
i thought so.:::['10-1-168']
oh, and listen to this.:::['10-1-169']
what do you know? it's a treat for the eyes and the ears.:::['10-1-170']
wow, it's, uh, kind of weird that i'm sitting next to charlie after we broke up.:::['10-1-172']
yeah. it's almost as if air barbados doesn't care about your social life.:::['10-1-173']
does someone mind switching and sitting with charlie?:::['10-1-174']
oh, i mean, i... dude, i spent the whole conference with charlie.:::['10-1-175']
i understand. no, i'll do it.:::['10-1-176']
wish i could switch. i really don't want to sit with allen lverson over there.:::['10-1-177']
um, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seat belt sign......you feel free to roam about my cabin.:::['10-1-178']
and you should be careful when checking your overhead bins.:::['10-1-179']
because items may shift during... oh, you're not good at this.:::['10-1-180']
do you have to go home tonight? no, i think i could come over.:::['10-1-181']
it's saturday, right? oh.:::['10-1-182']
um, i can't do anything tonight. why not?:::['10-1-184']
i have a date. wh...?:::['10-1-185']
you have a date? with who? oh, it's my girlfriend.:::['10-1-186']
you have a girlfriend? yeah.:::['10-1-187']
well, when you and i broke up, i started seeing someone.:::['10-1-188']
well, for how long? three months.:::['10-1-189']
three months?:::['10-1-190']
this is none of my business, but, um, how long are you gonna keep seeing her?:::['10-1-192']
i'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. i promise.:::['10-1-193']
oh, okay, good. you do that.:::['10-1-194']
when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.:::['10-1-195']
maybe i'll sign for it, tear it open.:::['10-1-196']
pull out the packing material... we'll have sex. let's leave it there.:::['10-1-197']
all right, i'm gonna go talk to joey. i think this is the right time.:::['10-1-198']
he's in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty-free.":::['10-1-199']
okay. good luck.:::['10-1-200', '2-4-279', '4-17-219']
ross is coming over. i think now would be a good time to talk to him.:::['10-1-201']
oh, i guess so. i'm just... i'm really nervous.:::['10-1-202']
well, keep in mind that by the time you're done......they'll probably be serving dinner.:::['10-1-203']
still nervous?:::['10-1-205']
i'm gonna get the lasagna.:::['10-1-206']
hey, rach, uh... yeah?:::['10-1-207']
do you mind if i sit here for a sec? yeah. yeah, sure. yeah.:::['10-1-208']
hey. ha. hey.:::['10-1-210']
so i, um...:::['10-1-211']
i kind of need to talk to you about charlie.:::['10-1-212']
yeah? last night, after you guys broke up...:::['10-1-213']
so sorry to hear about that, by the way. hmm, yeah.:::['10-1-214']
well, charlie and i were talking, and...:::['10-1-215']
you kissed. wh...?:::['10-1-217']
what? ha, ha.:::['10-1-218', '3-21-233']
what? ha, ha. what would give you that idea?:::['10-1-219']
i saw you. yeah, we kissed.:::['10-1-220']
but nothing else. nothing else happened, okay?:::['10-1-221']
ross, ross, ross. it's okay. what?:::['10-1-222']
it's okay. you know, look......i totally understand, all right? you guys......make way more sense than her:::['10-1-223']
and i ever did, you know? and...:::['10-1-224']
i want you to be happy. are you serious?:::['10-1-225']
now i have something... i am speechless.:::['10-1-227']
i mean, the fact that you would put my happiness first like that, i mean...:::['10-1-228']
you're an incredible friend, do you know that?:::['10-1-229']
oh, well, look, before you go... no, i mean it.:::['10-1-230']
i mean, you're so loyal, man. and selfless and generous.:::['10-1-231']
i am those things, yeah.:::['10-1-232']
i've known chandler longer, so i think of him as my best friend. but now......i may have to rethink some stuff.:::['10-1-233']
dude!:::['10-1-234']
hey, if there is ever anything i can do for you...:::['10-1-235']
i can't think of anything. ha, ha.:::['10-1-236']
ross: thanks. yeah.:::['10-1-237']
so hi. hi.:::['10-1-238']
so, you, uh, talked to joey? oh, yeah. we had a really good talk.:::['10-1-239']
oh. so everything's okay? oh. oh, no, it's great.:::['10-1-241']
it's great. he's an amazing guy. oh, well, obviously, i think so too.:::['10-1-242']
well, i'm so excited about this.:::['10-1-243']
really? ha, ha. excited?:::['10-1-244']
what, are you kidding? i have had some very dirty dreams about this.:::['10-1-245']
you didn't tell him, did you?:::['10-1-247']
i couldn't. he was saying all these really nice things about me.:::['10-1-248']
i didn't want him to get mad and take them back. i'm gonna edge out chandler! oh, god.:::['10-1-249']
fine. forget it. when we go back to new york, i will tell him.:::['10-1-250']
thank you. yeah, i appreciate that.:::['10-1-251']
hi, mike's place. hey, it's mike.:::['10-1-252']
ooh, that was fast. oh, uh, no, she's not here yet.:::['10-1-253']
you know, i'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone.:::['10-1-254']
you can't do that. oh, come on, mike, strap on a pair.:::['10-1-255']
why don't you tell her that we got back together. women appreciate honesty.:::['10-1-256']
we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while, just fyi.:::['10-1-257']
one more thing. there might be a picture of precious on my coffee table.:::['10-1-258']
her name's precious?:::['10-1-259']
is she a pure breed, or did you pick her up at the pound? ha, ha.:::['10-1-260']
i just want to give you a heads-up. okay. and if she gets upset......just scratch her tummy:::['10-1-261']
and give her a liver snap.:::['10-1-262']
hi. i'm precious. who are you?:::['10-1-263']
i'm... i'm phoebe. phoebe?:::['10-1-264']
mike's ex-girlfriend, phoebe? the love of his life? that phoebe?:::['10-1-265']
oh, i can't wait for everyone at work to see these!:::['10-1-266']
you go back to work tomorrow night? yeah.:::['10-1-268']
so if you want people to see them......you're not having them taken out,say, at the break of dawn?:::['10-1-269']
well, if i had them taken out, then i wouldn't be able to do this.:::['10-1-270']
aah! aah!:::['10-1-272', '2-12-68', '5-14-22']
you like that, right?:::['10-1-273']
what are you singing? it's "bolero" from 10.:::['10-1-274']
it's "ride of the valkyries" from apocalypse now.:::['10-1-275']
here's the thing. the cornrows were a solution to your frizzy-hair problem.:::['10-1-276']
now that we're home, you don't have that problem. if you think about it...:::['10-1-277']
i hate them.:::['10-1-278']
what? you said you liked them. did i? let's refresh.:::['10-1-279']
i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp.:::['10-1-280']
well, fine. so you don't like them. everybody else does.:::['10-1-281']
again, let's journey back.:::['10-1-282']
as i recall, rachel said she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.:::['10-1-283']
and joey? well, joey didn't realize there was anything different.:::['10-1-284']
you know what? i don't care. i like it, and i'm gonna keep it.:::['10-1-285']
you're just jealous because your hair can't do this.:::['10-1-286']
get yourself in the tooth? and the eye.:::['10-1-288']
hi! there she is! hi, emma. oh, my god, i missed you.:::['10-1-289']
oh, emma, i missed you so much. hi.:::['10-1-290']
did you have a good time with grandma green? huh?:::['10-1-291']
did she give you a bottle of antidepressants again to use as a rattle?:::['10-1-292']
that was one time, ross, and they were only, like, five milligrams.:::['10-1-293']
ooh, hey, emma, daddy has some presents for you, okay? i want you to wait right here.:::['10-1-294']
come here, sweetie. rachel: oh.:::['10-1-295']
ross, um, actually, there's something that, uh... ...i really need to talk to you about.:::['10-1-296']
okay, shoot.:::['10-1-297']
okay. um, all right, here's the deal. ah! oh, no!:::['10-1-298']
what is it? oh, major shampoo explosion!:::['10-1-299']
uh, look, ross, this really isn't easy. oh, it's all over everything!:::['10-1-300']
why? why me?:::['10-1-301']
because you took 300 bottles of shampoo?:::['10-1-302']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. you were saying?:::['10-1-303']
well, yeah, uh... look, it's about me and... oh, not another one!:::['10-1-304']
oh, my god... oh, and this is moisturizer! it's even harder to clean!:::['10-1-305']
why? why do bad things happen to good people?:::['10-1-306']
wow. clearly this is not a good time. uh, you think?:::['10-1-307']
all right, so mike's on his way over.:::['10-1-309']
you thought you were meeting here, he thought at the restaurant, so...:::['10-1-310']
it doesn't matter who's right or wrong. the point is, i'm gonna take off.:::['10-1-311']
wait. i'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on. i mean......are you guys getting back together:::['10-1-312']
or something?:::['10-1-313']
susie... can i call you susie?:::['10-1-315']
my name is precious.:::['10-1-316']
i can't say that.:::['10-1-317']
um, susie, i'm gonna be straight with you.:::['10-1-318']
mike and i are back together. and, um, unfortunately......that effectively ends:::['10-1-319']
your relationship with him.:::['10-1-320']
he's very sorry about that, and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavors.:::['10-1-321']
i just can't believe this. why?:::['10-1-322']
well, i don't... why would he do this?:::['10-1-323']
what's wrong with me? there's nothing wrong with you.:::['10-1-324']
what the hell am i supposed to do now?:::['10-1-325']
damn it, woman! pull yourself together!:::['10-1-326']
have some pride, for the love of god!:::['10-1-327']
okay, not a fan of the tough love.:::['10-1-328']
i just can't believe that mike didn't give me any warning.:::['10-1-329']
he didn't know. he wasn't planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me.:::['10-1-330']
he proposed to you? this is the worst birthday ever!:::['10-1-331']
look, precious...:::['10-1-332']
mike's not worth this. you're an attractive, intelligent woman......and let's face it, mike's kind of a wang.:::['10-1-333']
he proposed to me while he was still seeing you.:::['10-1-334']
he was gonna break up with you on your birthday?:::['10-1-335']
i don't like to kiss and tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.:::['10-1-336']
oh, my god, you know, maybe you're right. maybe i don't need him.:::['10-1-337']
i deserve to be treated with respect.:::['10-1-338']
screw you, mike. you're a coward and a bastard, and i hope you rot in hell!:::['10-1-339']
honey? you've been in there for a long time. is everything okay?:::['10-1-341']
monica: not really.:::['10-1-342']
i have a problem.:::['10-1-343']
really? what happened?:::['10-1-344']
well, i was dancing around and singing "no woman, no cry"......and, um, i got stuck.:::['10-1-345']
you can't move at all? oh, i can move. ha, ha.:::['10-1-346']
if i untangle you, will you please get rid of the cornrows?:::['10-1-347']
some of these look a little frayed. yeah, i tried to gnaw myself free.:::['10-1-349']
so? did you, uh, tell ross? well, i tried......but then he had:::['10-1-351']
a shampoo-related emergency.:::['10-1-352']
so i guess now it's your turn again. no, no, no, no.:::['10-1-353']
i think it's better if you tell him. you know, it's easier for a woman.:::['10-1-354']
that way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go::::['10-1-355']
"i didn't mean it.:::['10-1-356']
i'm so sorry.":::['10-1-357']
yeah, because that's what we do.:::['10-1-358']
all right, all right, okay. um, how about this? how about this? tomorrow...:::['10-1-359']
mm-hm?:::['10-1-360']
tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.:::['10-1-361']
okay, that sounds fair.:::['10-1-362']
that just means, once again, we can't... i know.:::['10-1-363']
that's okay. i mean, we can control ourselves. we're not animals.:::['10-1-364']
no! pfft. of course, we can wait. yeah.:::['10-1-365']
all right, so i guess that means good night then.:::['10-1-366']
yep. good night.:::['10-1-367']
good night. stop saying good night.:::['10-1-370']
look what i found in the drawer.:::['10-1-373']
and you said i'd never wear this.:::['10-1-374']
now that i untangled you, how about you do a little something for me?:::['10-1-375']
sure. what did you have in mind? i think you know.:::['10-1-376']
really? i don't... i don't really feel like it. this is what i want to do.:::['10-1-377']
i just don't get why you like it so much.:::['10-1-379']
she's an fbi agent posing as a beauty contestant!:::['10-1-380']
oh, hey, joey. mmm.:::['10-12-0']
hey. listen, i need to ask you something.:::['10-12-1']
you know how my stepdad's in prison?:::['10-12-2']
he was supposed to get a weekend furlough so he could go to the wedding.:::['10-12-4']
but he just called and...:::['10-12-5']
well, apparently stabbing iceman in the exercise yard couldn't wait till monday.:::['10-12-6']
so he can't come? no.:::['10-12-7']
and so there's no one to walk me down the aisle. and...:::['10-12-8']
well, i would just really love it if you would do it.:::['10-12-9']
seriously? yeah.:::['10-12-10']
you've, you know, sort of been like a dad to me.:::['10-12-11']
you've always, you know, looked out for me and shared your wisdom.:::['10-12-12']
i am pretty "wisdomous.":::['10-12-13']
so, what do you say?:::['10-12-14']
are you kidding? phoebe, i would be honored.:::['10-12-15']
phoebe: oh, thank you.:::['10-12-16']
i hope...:::['10-12-17']
i hope you know how much you mean to me.:::['10-12-18']
listen, i hope...:::['10-12-19']
i hope that you know...:::['10-12-20']
i don't want you to see your father cry. go to your room!:::['10-12-21']
oh. oh, no, no, no. let your dad get this.:::['10-12-22']
oh. it's my wedding planner. she's driving me crazy!:::['10-12-23']
hello? okay, stop screaming!:::['10-12-24']
okay, so halibut.:::['10-12-25']
all right, so salmon. either way. i don't...:::['10-12-26']
it doesn't matter to me. well, it matters to me!:::['10-12-27']
well, i don't care. so you pick.:::['10-12-28']
did you just hang up on me?:::['10-12-29']
all right, look, i need you at the rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.:::['10-12-30']
okay. what time is that?:::['10-12-31']
you don't know military time?:::['10-12-32']
i must have been in missile training the day they taught that.:::['10-12-33']
just subtract 12.:::['10-12-34']
okay, so 1800 minus 12......is 1788.:::['10-12-35']
six o'clock! okay.:::['10-12-36']
hold on. yeah? geller here.:::['10-12-37']
no, i said it has to be there by 4:00. goodbye.:::['10-12-38']
how hard is it to make an ice sculpture?:::['10-12-39']
that sounds really fancy.:::['10-12-40']
i told you, i just want a simple wedding.:::['10-12-41']
please, honey, leave the details to me.:::['10-12-42']
now, i wanna make this day as special for you as i can.:::['10-12-43']
i was thinking the harpist should wear white.:::['10-12-44']
harpist? my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums.:::['10-12-45']
oh, she backed out. she did? why?:::['10-12-46']
i made her.:::['10-12-47']
steel drums don't really say "elegant wedding.":::['10-12-48']
nor does marjorie's overwhelming scent. hey!:::['10-12-49']
she will shower when tibet is free.:::['10-12-50']
chandler: hey. you look great. phoebe: you too.:::['10-12-51']
i'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner. i rarely practice my meals before i eat.:::['10-12-52']
what did we say was your one gift to us?:::['10-12-53']
no stupid jokes, but i thought that was for the actual wedding.:::['10-12-54']
rehearse it.:::['10-12-55']
thanks for coming, you guys. oh, yeah...:::['10-12-57']
i was... i was going for a handshake.:::['10-12-58']
that why your hand's against my crotch?:::['10-12-59']
that is why. mike: yeah.:::['10-12-60']
so, rach, where's emma?:::['10-12-61']
monica made me send her to my mom's.:::['10-12-62']
apparently, babies and weddings don't mix.:::['10-12-63']
are you still crying about your damn baby?:::['10-12-64']
pheebs, you got to keep the line moving. remember, 20 seconds per person.:::['10-12-65']
you see these clowns all the time.:::['10-12-66']
hey, you're mike's parents, right? yes, we are.:::['10-12-67']
gosh, our little ones are growing up fast, aren't they?:::['10-12-68']
how's that? you know......on one hand, you're happy for them.:::['10-12-69']
on the other, it's hard to let go.:::['10-12-70']
who in god's name are you?:::['10-12-71']
i'm not that fond of you either, buddy. i'm just trying to be nice for the kids.:::['10-12-72']
you know what? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.:::['10-12-73']
i thought we'd be groomsmen. they would have asked us by now.:::['10-12-74']
when did they ask you to be a bridesmaid?:::['10-12-75']
november. i wanna say it's not looking good.:::['10-12-76']
hey, pheebs? huh?:::['10-12-77']
you haven't told these guys what they're doing in the wedding yet.:::['10-12-78']
um, well, they're not in the wedding.:::['10-12-79']
well......this is really awkward.:::['10-12-81']
oh, and i can leave.:::['10-12-82']
i'm sorry, you guys. but mike's got his brother and his friends from school.:::['10-12-83']
so, you know, you were...:::['10-12-84']
if it helps, you were next in line. you just missed the cut.:::['10-12-85']
this is like figure skating team all over again.:::['10-12-87']
i mean, synchronized swimming.:::['10-12-88']
i mean... i mean, the balance beam.:::['10-12-89']
help me. football.:::['10-12-90']
oh, pheebs, spit that out. that has pork in it.:::['10-12-92']
phoebe: oh! oh!:::['10-12-93']
i thought the pot stickers were supposed to be vegetarian?:::['10-12-94']
yeah, i changed them. i sent you a fax about it.:::['10-12-95']
i don't have a fax machine.:::['10-12-96']
huh. well, then there are gonna be a few surprises.:::['10-12-97']
i can't believe we're gonna be the only people not in the wedding.:::['10-12-98']
i know. i hate being left out of things. and it's a wedding.:::['10-12-99']
it'll be weird if i'm not in it.:::['10-12-100']
hey, guys, how's it going? fine.:::['10-12-101']
we're sitting here, alone, doing nothing. it's our rehearsal for tomorrow.:::['10-12-102']
look, about tomorrow, i've got a question for you.:::['10-12-103']
i found out one of my groomsmen had an emergency and can't make it.:::['10-12-104']
what happened? who cares? and?:::['10-12-105']
and i was wondering if one of you guys...:::['10-12-106']
i'll do it! me!:::['10-12-107']
you both wanna do it? there's only room for one.:::['10-12-108']
pick me. i look great in a tux, and i won't steal focus.:::['10-12-109']
no, mike. no, no, you wanna pick me. i mean... watch.:::['10-12-110']
you know, i really don't feel very comfortable making this decision.:::['10-12-112']
you know, phoebe knows you better. i'm gonna let her choose.:::['10-12-113']
well, if phoebe's choosing, then say hello to mike's next groomsman.:::['10-12-114']
oh, i will. but i will need a mirror......as he is me.:::['10-12-115']
please. you're going down. you are going "downer.":::['10-12-116']
they say that on the figure skating team?:::['10-12-117']
i wouldn't know. i didn't make it.:::['10-12-118']
you know i'm filling in for phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?:::['10-12-119']
yeah. yeah. hey, thanks for doing that. oh, hey, my pleasure.:::['10-12-120']
so, what are your intentions with my phoebe?:::['10-12-121']
i intend to marry her. oh, a wiseacre.:::['10-12-122']
i understand you plan to support your wife by playing the piano?:::['10-12-123']
isn't that kind of unstable?:::['10-12-124']
no more so than acting. strike two.:::['10-12-125']
you're right. she probably will support me.:::['10-12-126']
hey, unless we move in with you, dad.:::['10-12-127']
strike three.:::['10-12-128']
you only get one more, mike.:::['10-12-129']
so? what did you decide?:::['10-12-130']
i decided to pee.:::['10-12-131']
you have to choose one of us to be in your wedding.:::['10-12-132']
one of the groomsmen fell out. oh, no, no.:::['10-12-133']
i can't choose between you two. i love you both so much.:::['10-12-134']
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.:::['10-12-135']
but i don't wanna choose. it's...:::['10-12-136']
okay, wait. rach? yeah?:::['10-12-137']
listen, i have a very special bridesmaid task for you to do.:::['10-12-138']
goody! what is it?:::['10-12-139']
well, there's a spot open for only one groomsman......and you have to choose between ross:::['10-12-140']
and chandler. so good luck with that.:::['10-12-141']
what? what, what, what? no, i don't wanna do that.:::['10-12-142']
i guess i have to find a new bridesmaid.:::['10-12-143']
i'll do it!:::['10-12-144', '10-12-363']
okay, it's 2100 hours.:::['10-12-145']
time for your toast. do i have time to go to the bathroom?:::['10-12-146']
you had a bathroom break at 2030. pee on your own time, mike.:::['10-12-147']
in regards to the toasts, okay, you wanna keep them short.:::['10-12-148']
nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches. okay.:::['10-12-149']
you just get in, do your thing, and get out.:::['10-12-150']
is that what you say to chandler?:::['10-12-151']
it's 2101, and i am not amused.:::['10-12-152']
the bride and groom have a few words they'd like to say.:::['10-12-154']
okay. hello, everyone.:::['10-12-155']
and thank you all for being here tonight. so tomorrow's the big event.:::['10-12-156']
some of you might not know, but mike and i didn't get off to the best start.:::['10-12-157']
yeah. my friend joey and i......decided to fix each other up:::['10-12-158']
with friends. so i...:::['10-12-159']
oh, okay. i...:::['10-12-160']
i thought about it, and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen......who couldn't be here tonight,because... it's not...:::['10-12-161']
it's not important. well, she's in rehab.:::['10-12-162']
anyway. so joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike......only he didn't have a friend mike,so he just brought my mike. and... and...:::['10-12-163']
but despite, you know... it got good.:::['10-12-164']
i wanna take a moment to mention my mother, who couldn't be here.:::['10-12-165']
and... and moment's over.:::['10-12-167']
so okay... oh, no, forget that.:::['10-12-168']
i can forget that. oh, this is funny.:::['10-12-169']
oh, but you need to know that to get that.:::['10-12-170']
so... oh, well, okay.:::['10-12-171']
i... okay.:::['10-12-172']
okay, monica, i can't do it like this!:::['10-12-173']
this is my wedding, okay? i don't want this...:::['10-12-174']
or this... or this...:::['10-12-175']
okay? i just wanted a simple wedding......where my fiancé can go:::['10-12-176']
to the bathroom any time he wants!:::['10-12-177']
you know what? you're done. what?:::['10-12-178']
you're fired!:::['10-12-179']
cheers.:::['10-12-180', '2-24-266', '3-2-309']
hey. happy wedding day.:::['10-12-181']
happy my wedding day to you.:::['10-12-182']
joey, listen, this is gonna be bridesmaid central, all right?:::['10-12-183']
we're gonna have hair and makeup in the bathroom.:::['10-12-184']
i had to move a couple things in the fridge to make room for the corsages.:::['10-12-185']
man! i wouldn't have had breakfast if i knew there was gonna be corsages.:::['10-12-186']
about last night...:::['10-12-188']
i know you're under a lot of stress, and...:::['10-12-189']
well, even though the things you said hurt me a little bit...:::['10-12-190']
my point is...:::['10-12-191']
well, i'm willing to take my job back.:::['10-12-192']
oh, well, that's okay.:::['10-12-193', '3-6-128']
i think you and i will do much better if you're just here as a bridesmaid.:::['10-12-194']
oh, is that so?:::['10-12-195']
if that's really what you want, then here.:::['10-12-197']
i give you the headset. i don't really wanna give you the headset.:::['10-12-198']
i guess if you're taking over, then you should probably return these messages.:::['10-12-199']
this is a lot. uh-huh.:::['10-12-200']
but i'm sure you can handle this. i have won awards......for my organizational skills.:::['10-12-201']
but i'm sure you'll do fine.:::['10-12-202']
you've won awards? i printed them out on my computer.:::['10-12-203']
where's rach? she's in her room. why?:::['10-12-205']
i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation.:::['10-12-206']
i'm not gonna watch chandler up there while i'm in the seats like some chump.:::['10-12-207']
my god, you're breathtaking.:::['10-12-208']
you haven't by any chance chosen a groomsman yet, have you?:::['10-12-210']
ross, please don't make this harder than it already is.:::['10-12-211']
i'm not. i'm making it easier. pick me.:::['10-12-212']
chandler said it's important to him too. listen. listen.:::['10-12-213']
whoever you pick is gonna walk down the aisle with you.:::['10-12-214']
now, i promise i won't say a word. but if you pick chandler......he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes:::['10-12-215']
in your ear the whole time.:::['10-12-216']
oh, you are the lesser of two evils.:::['10-12-217']
sven, i don't understand what you're saying. what is wrong with the flowers?:::['10-12-219']
"lorkins"? what the hell are "lorkins"?:::['10-12-220']
hey. mike, if you were swedish......and you were saying the word:::['10-12-222']
"lorkins," what flower would that be?:::['10-12-223']
orchids? right there!:::['10-12-224']
that's why i'm marrying you.:::['10-12-225']
hello, michael.:::['10-12-226']
may i have a word with you, please?:::['10-12-228']
this is......great.:::['10-12-229']
last night......i tried to welcome you into my family.:::['10-12-231']
and instead, you disrespect me.:::['10-12-232']
i cannot allow this.:::['10-12-233']
are you rehearsing for some really bad mafia movie?:::['10-12-234']
more back talk.:::['10-12-235']
and yes, i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition......for family honor 2::::['10-12-236']
this a-time it's a-personal.:::['10-12-237']
joey, i kind of have a lot to do today. what do you want?:::['10-12-238']
i want you to take this seriously!:::['10-12-239']
phoebe is very, very important to me, okay?:::['10-12-240']
i wanna make sure you are gonna take care of her.:::['10-12-241']
joe, i love phoebe.:::['10-12-242']
she's the most important thing in my life.:::['10-12-243']
i'd die before i let anything happen to her.:::['10-12-244']
that's what i wanted to hear.:::['10-12-245']
because she's family, okay?:::['10-12-246']
and now you're gonna be family.:::['10-12-247']
and there's nothing more important in the whole world than family.:::['10-12-248']
that must have been one lousy movie.:::['10-12-249']
that was me!:::['10-12-250']
hi. let's talk about this groomsman thing.:::['10-12-251']
if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the aisle just fine.:::['10-12-252']
but if you choose me......you'll be getting some comedy.:::['10-12-253']
even so......i think i'm gonna pick ross.:::['10-12-254']
let me tell you why you need to pick me.:::['10-12-255']
see, when i was a kid, you know, i was always left out of everything......and it really made me feel insecure.:::['10-12-257']
i was always picked last in gym......even behind that fat exchange student:::['10-12-258']
who didn't know the rules to baseball.:::['10-12-259']
i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third.:::['10-12-260']
anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding......i just know that all those feelings:::['10-12-261']
are gonna come rushing back.:::['10-12-262']
all right, fine, i pick you.:::['10-12-263']
make "groom" for chandler.:::['10-12-265']
no, we're gonna do it my way. because your way is stupid.:::['10-12-267']
all right, i got to go. i have another call, reverend.:::['10-12-268']
i'm glad we had this little talk. yes.:::['10-12-270']
and thanks for all the wedding night advice.:::['10-12-271']
that didn't make me uncomfortable at all.:::['10-12-272']
all right, so i'll see everybody tonight.:::['10-12-273']
did you guys know that there's a giant ice sculpture in the hall?:::['10-12-275']
phoebe: oh, my god, what's it doing here?:::['10-12-276']
i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address.:::['10-12-277']
what a pickle. oh, my god, everything's such a mess.:::['10-12-278']
why is this happening to me?:::['10-12-279']
how bad do you wanna stick your tongue on that?:::['10-12-280']
how's it going? ross: good.:::['10-12-281']
i'm just getting some coffee so i'm alert for the wedding.:::['10-12-282']
that's what i was doing too.:::['10-12-283']
well, you have fun tonight.:::['10-12-284']
you too. oh, i will.:::['10-12-285']
wait a minute. i know why i'm being such an ass. why are you?:::['10-12-287']
i'm not supposed to tell you. i'm not supposed to tell you.:::['10-12-288']
you told us both we could be in the wedding?:::['10-12-289']
in my defense, you weren't supposed to tell each other!:::['10-12-290']
rachel, only one of us can do it. you have to choose.:::['10-12-291']
you and me together again.:::['10-12-292']
rach, rach? knock-knock.:::['10-12-293']
who's there? i'll tell you at the wedding.:::['10-12-294']
hey, i forgot my scarf.:::['10-12-295']
i can't do this. i don't know which one of you guys to pick.:::['10-12-296']
oh, you haven't picked yet? oh, good, because i had an idea.:::['10-12-297']
i thought it would be fun if the third groomsman was my family dog, chappy.:::['10-12-298']
what? a dog? no. rachel gets to choose.:::['10-12-299']
wow, this is a tough one.:::['10-12-300']
i think i'm gonna have to go with the dog.:::['10-12-301']
so, what you're saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club......but the food is not? and the drinks:::['10-12-302']
are there but the bartender is not?:::['10-12-303']
are you freaking kidding me?:::['10-12-304']
help me. what?:::['10-12-306']
i want you to be crazy bitch again.:::['10-12-307']
you really want me to come back? more than i wanna get married.:::['10-12-310']
okay, people, we are back in business!:::['10-12-311']
oh, god, i have missed you so much. okay.:::['10-12-312']
get your hair and makeup done. i'll take care of everything.:::['10-12-313']
hey, what are you guys gonna do? about what?:::['10-12-314']
the blizzard. i just saw on the news......it's the worst snowstorm:::['10-12-315']
in 20 years.:::['10-12-316']
they already closed all the bridges and tunnels.:::['10-12-317']
but the band and the photographer are coming in from new jersey.:::['10-12-318']
i don't think they are.:::['10-12-319']
ha-ha! looks like you're not gonna be in the wedding, either.:::['10-12-320']
so sorry, pheebs.:::['10-12-321']
well, the club lost its power. the news said most of the city did.:::['10-12-322']
since when do you watch the news? for your information......since they hired:::['10-12-323']
a very hot weather girl.:::['10-12-324']
i can't believe you aren't getting married today.:::['10-12-325']
phoebe: i know.:::['10-12-326']
it's so beautiful out there. you always wanted to get married outside.:::['10-12-327']
why don't you just do it on the street? what?:::['10-12-328']
well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.:::['10-12-329']
i mean, you couldn't ask for a more romantic setting.:::['10-12-330']
this could be the simple wedding you've always wanted.:::['10-12-331']
i think i wanna get married to you today.:::['10-12-333']
me too. monica, do you think we could do it?:::['10-12-334']
affirmative!:::['10-12-335']
okay, let's get these chairs out here!:::['10-12-336']
gunther, hit the christmas lights.:::['10-12-337']
okay, who left the ice sculpture on the steam grate?:::['10-12-339']
mrs. hannigan: michael. mike: hey, you made it. great. chappy!:::['10-12-340']
there you go. mike: hi. hi.:::['10-12-341']
i know getting married in the street isn't what you approve of.:::['10-12-342']
no, it's lovely. the lights and the snow. i could look at them forever.:::['10-12-343']
i crushed a pill and put it in her drink.:::['10-12-344']
come on, sweetheart.:::['10-12-345']
you know, chappy's too small to handle all this snow.:::['10-12-346']
someone has to walk him down the aisle.:::['10-12-347']
would this person be in the wedding? i guess.:::['10-12-348']
i'll do it! i'll do it!:::['10-12-349']
chandler, hello? i mean, aren't you scared of dogs?:::['10-12-350']
i'm not scared. i'll just take little chappy and...:::['10-12-351']
he can sense my fear! my throat is exposed!:::['10-12-352']
well, i guess i'm in the wedding then.:::['10-12-353']
he stinks.:::['10-12-354']
level one alert! i repeat, level one, this is not a drill!:::['10-12-355']
we have a situation. the minister called. he's snowed in, he can't make it.:::['10-12-356']
oh, no. joey: hey, don't worry.:::['10-12-357']
i'm still ordained from your wedding. really?:::['10-12-358']
yeah. you think i'd give up being a minister and pay to ride the subway?:::['10-12-359']
ministers don't ride the subway for free.:::['10-12-360']
i had to read the bible pretty carefully, but, yeah, we do.:::['10-12-361']
we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the aisle.:::['10-12-362']
okay, mike and joey, get in position.:::['10-12-364']
chandler, come with me.:::['10-12-365']
okay, joey's doing the ceremony, and chandler's giving you away.:::['10-12-366']
oh, okay. hi, new dad.:::['10-12-367']
so you ready to do this? oh, my god. this is really happening.:::['10-12-368']

i love you guys. i love you.:::['10-12-372']
okay, it's zero hour! all teams execute on my count!:::['10-12-373']
let's get this bad boy on the road!:::['10-12-374']
is it okay i want you to wear that headset in bed?:::['10-12-375']
i have you scheduled for nudity at 2300 hours.:::['10-12-376']
okay, marjorie, hit it.:::['10-12-378']
jeez, ross. you could've showered. it's the dog.:::['10-12-379']
groomsman? why are you standing there? where's your bridesmaid?:::['10-12-380']
we've got a broken arrow! bridesmaid down!:::['10-12-381']
oh, that's me.:::['10-12-382', '5-16-254']
ready? okay.:::['10-12-383']
oh, wait. oh, no. wait.:::['10-12-384']

the cold has now spread to my special place......so i'm gonna do:::['10-12-394']
the short version of this.:::['10-12-395']
phoebe and mike are perfect for each other.:::['10-12-396']
and i know i speak for everyone here......when i wish them:::['10-12-397']
a lifetime of happiness.:::['10-12-398']
who has the rings?:::['10-12-399']
when i was growing up, i didn't have a normal mom and dad......or a regular family like everybody else.:::['10-12-401']
and i always knew that something was missing.:::['10-12-402']
but now i'm standing here today......knowing that i have everything:::['10-12-403']
i'm ever gonna need.:::['10-12-404']
you are my family.:::['10-12-405']
phoebe, you are so beautiful.:::['10-12-406']
you're so kind. you're so generous.:::['10-12-407']
you're so wonderfully weird.:::['10-12-408']
every day with you is an adventure.:::['10-12-409']
and i can't believe how lucky i am.:::['10-12-410']
and i can't wait to share my life with you forever.:::['10-12-411']
oh, wait! oh, i forgot. and......i love you.:::['10-12-412']
and you have nice eyes.:::['10-12-413']
chappy's heart rate has slowed way down.:::['10-12-416']
okay. phoebe......do you take this man:::['10-12-417']
to be your husband?:::['10-12-418']
mike, do you take this woman to be your wife?:::['10-12-421']
i now pronounce you......husband and wife.:::['10-12-423']
i got married!:::['10-12-424']
could someone get me a coat? i'm frigging freezing.:::['10-12-425']

i kind of don't want it to end. hey......you wanna come in for a drink:::['10-12-427']
and a bite of corsage?:::['10-12-428']
i'd love to, but it's 2300 hours......and i'm about to have the most:::['10-12-429']
organized sex anyone's ever had.:::['10-12-430']
whatever happened to ross? i don't know.:::['10-12-431']

come on, chappy! do your business! make!:::['10-12-433']

so, uh, why is erica coming to visit? we wanna get to know her better.:::['10-13-30']
and, uh, she's never been to new york, so she wants to see the tourist spots::::['10-13-31']
statue of liberty, empire state building.:::['10-13-32']
oh, there's always so many people, and they're being corralled like cattle.:::['10-13-33']
and, you know, there's always some idiot who goes, "moo.":::['10-13-34']
well, if it annoys you so much, then why do you do it?:::['10-13-35']
ross: oh, hi! hi!:::['10-13-36']
thanks for showing up 30 minutes late. ross.:::['10-13-37']

uh, a mani-pedi? was there a sale at barneys?:::['10-13-39']
my father had a heart attack.:::['10-13-40']

oh, my god, rach. honey?:::['10-13-42']
i'm so sorry. uh, is he okay?:::['10-13-43']
yeah, he's gonna be fine, but he's heavily sedated.:::['10-13-44']
okay, i'm gonna go to long island with you.:::['10-13-45']
i mean, you can't be alone right now. no, come on, i'm totally okay.:::['10-13-46']
i don't need you to come.:::['10-13-47']
i can totally handle this on my own. still, still, let me come for me.:::['10-13-48']
okay. if you really need to.:::['10-13-49']
i bet someone could use one of monica's freshly baked cookies.:::['10-13-50']
oh, i really could. oh.:::['10-13-51']
all right, it seems pretty simple.:::['10-13-53']
your first line is, "my name is claude.":::['10-13-54']
okay. so just repeat after me.:::['10-13-55']
well, let's try it again. okay.:::['10-13-56']

it's really nice to meet you guys. i can't believe i'm here.:::['10-13-72']
well, welcome to new york city, or should i say::::['10-13-73']
...new york city.:::['10-13-74']
why would you say that?:::['10-13-75']
okay. what are you gonna be doing today?:::['10-13-76']
well, i wanna see everything! times square, coney island, rockefeller center.:::['10-13-77']
you should walk to the top of the statue of liberty.:::['10-13-78']
oh, yeah, let's do that. great.:::['10-13-79']
this baby better be really good.:::['10-13-80']
hi, um, uh, excuse me, i'm here to see my father. my name is rachel green.:::['10-13-81']
and i'm dr. ross geller. ross, please, this is a hospital.:::['10-13-82']
that actually means something here.:::['10-13-83']
so can we please go in? absolutely.:::['10-13-84']
rach, i think i'm gonna wait out here......because, uh, my throat is feeling a:::['10-13-85']
little scratchy. i don't wanna infect him.:::['10-13-86']
ross, please. don't be so scared of him. i am not scared of him. i'm really sick.:::['10-13-87']
he's under sedation, so he's out. i'm feeling better.:::['10-13-88']
oh, oh, wow.:::['10-13-90']
that ear and nose hair trimmer i got him was just money down the drain, huh?:::['10-13-91']
ms. green? your father's doctor's on the phone if you'd like to speak to him.:::['10-13-92']
oh, great. um, are you gonna be okay?:::['10-13-93']
he's unconscious. we'll be just fine. okay.:::['10-13-94']
uh, did the tv wake you? no.:::['10-13-95']
when you put your feet up on my bed, you tugged on my catheter.:::['10-13-96']
ouchy.:::['10-13-97']
what are you doing here, geller?:::['10-13-98']
well, i came with rachel, who should be back any second.:::['10-13-99']
so, what's new? oh, i had a little heart attack.:::['10-13-100']
right. is it painful?:::['10-13-101']
what, the heart attack or sitting here talking to you?:::['10-13-102']
let's see if we can get that rachel back in here.:::['10-13-103']
so, what's new with you? knocked up any more of my daughters lately?:::['10-13-104']
nope. just the one. rachel!:::['10-13-105']
okay, maybe if we just break it down.:::['10-13-107']
okay, let's try it one syllable at a time. okay, so repeat after me.:::['10-13-108']
great! okay, faster.:::['10-13-109']
okay, it's too hard. i can't teach you. what are you doing?:::['10-13-110']
i have to go before i put your head through a wall.:::['10-13-111']
no, no. don't go, i need you! my audition is tomorrow!:::['10-13-112']
i was gonna make us some dinner......but all i found in your dad's fridge:::['10-13-114']
was bacon and heavy cream.:::['10-13-115']
i think we solved the mystery of the heart attack.:::['10-13-116']
did you call your parents? oh, yeah. emma's doing great.:::['10-13-117']
i just can't believe i'm in rachel green's room.:::['10-13-121']
you've been in my room before. hah, yeah, sure, right. ha, ha.:::['10-13-122']
like i'd ever be in rachel green's room.:::['10-13-123']
okay, i gotta tell you, it's really weird when you use my whole name.:::['10-13-124']
oh, ha, ha. sorry.:::['10-13-125']
yeah, you had a rough day, huh? yeah.:::['10-13-127']
it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know? i mean, he's a doctor.:::['10-13-128']
you don't expect doctors to get sick.:::['10-13-129']
but we do.:::['10-13-130']
well, he's gonna be okay, rach.:::['10-13-131']
i don't want him to wake up alone. i should go to the hospital.:::['10-13-133']
what? no, no. hey, hey, look. what?:::['10-13-134']
they gave him a lot of medication.:::['10-13-135']
he wouldn't even know if you were there.:::['10-13-136']
we'll go see him first thing in the morning.:::['10-13-137']
really? i shouldn't feel guilty? no-- god, hey.:::['10-13-138']
rach, you've been an amazing daughter, okay?:::['10-13-139']
right now you need to get some rest. okay, maybe you're right.:::['10-13-140']
would you stay here with me for a little while?:::['10-13-143']
thank you for coming with me today. oh, of course.:::['10-13-145']
rachel green is very happy you're in her room.:::['10-13-146']
me too. come here. no.:::['10-13-147']
i just don't wanna be alone tonight.:::['10-13-148']
okay, well, um, i can maybe grab a sleeping bag or--:::['10-13-149']
no, rach!:::['10-13-150']
i'm sorry, i just don't think this is a good idea.:::['10-13-151']
well, we won't know that until we do it, will we?:::['10-13-152']
no, um, uh, look, um.:::['10-13-153']
you are upset about your father, and you're feeling vulnerable......and i just don't feel:::['10-13-154']
it would be right.:::['10-13-155']
i feel like i'd be, you know, taking advantage of you.:::['10-13-156']
what--? taking advantage? i am giving you the advantage. enjoy!:::['10-13-157']
look, i'm sure it would be great......but i think one of us:::['10-13-158']
has to be thinking clearly.:::['10-13-159']
so i'm gonna go.:::['10-13-160']
i'll see you in the morning. mm-hm.:::['10-13-163']
i haven't had sex in four months. i should get a medal for that!:::['10-13-164']
thanks so much for taking me to all those places. i had a great time.:::['10-13-165']
oh, i'm glad. listen, i wanna apologize about chandler, though.:::['10-13-166']
i just did not see this coming. new york is awesome!:::['10-13-167']
what is with you? i've been to these places before......but i've never really seen them.:::['10-13-168']
yeah, you miss a lot when you're mooing.:::['10-13-169']
thanks so much for showing me around. oh, it was our pleasure.:::['10-13-170']
we're so much enjoying getting to know you.:::['10-13-171']
well, if there's anything else you wanna know...:::['10-13-172']
okay, um.:::['10-13-174']
can we ask you some questions about the father?:::['10-13-175']
oh, sure. yeah.:::['10-13-176']
well, he was my high-school boyfriend, captain of the football team, really cute.:::['10-13-177']
got a scholarship and went to college. that's great.:::['10-13-178']
yeah, it's almost definitely him.:::['10-13-179']
how's that, now?:::['10-13-180']
well, there's a chance it's another guy.:::['10-13-181']
i mean, i've only ever been with two guys......but they sort of overlapped.:::['10-13-182']
so, what does the other guy do?:::['10-13-183']
does he go to college too? no, he's in prison.:::['10-13-184']
well, um, was he falsely accused of something?:::['10-13-186']
he killed his father with a shovel.:::['10-13-188']
other than that, he's a great guy.:::['10-13-189']
i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.:::['10-13-190']
are you awake? of course i'm awake.:::['10-13-191']
assume from now on that i'm always awake.:::['10-13-192']
all right, we don't know that it's him. i mean, it could be the football guy.:::['10-13-193']
honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel killer.:::['10-13-194']
well, all right, let's say that it is him.:::['10-13-195']
would we not want the baby? no.:::['10-13-196']
would we treat him any differently? i'd keep an eye on him.:::['10-13-197']
we have to find out which the father is.:::['10-13-198']
how? i don't know.:::['10-13-199']
they have tests for these things, right? yeah, but maybe we're overreacting.:::['10-13-200']
easy for you to say. he's a father killer.:::['10-13-201']
he probably loves his mommy.:::['10-13-202']
he's probably got a tattoo that says "mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.:::['10-13-203']
we'll now count from one to five.:::['10-13-204']
on recording]:::['10-13-205']
hey. hey, joey-:::['10-13-207']
listen, i feel really badly about yesterday, and i thought about it a lot.:::['10-13-208']
no, i was too impatient. so let's try it again.:::['10-13-209']
that's okay. i don't need your help.:::['10-13-210']
i worked on it myself, and i gotta say, i am pretty good.:::['10-13-211']
really, can i hear some of it? sure, sure.:::['10-13-212']
right, but you're not--:::['10-13-215']
you're not-- you're--:::['10-13-216']
again, you're not speaking french!:::['10-13-217']
oh, well, i think i am! yeah, and i think i'm definitely gonna get the part!:::['10-13-218']
how could you possibly think that?:::['10-13-219']
the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job!:::['10-13-220']
hey, rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?:::['10-13-221']
you've been quiet all morning. ls everything okay?:::['10-13-223']
you sure you're all right? yep.:::['10-13-225']
well, i'm gonna go, uh, grab us some breakfast.:::['10-13-227']
fyi. there it is.:::['10-13-228']
in the future, when a girl asks for some ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.:::['10-13-229']
wait, wait, you're, uh, mad at me about last night?:::['10-13-230']
i was just trying to do the right thing. really?:::['10-13-231']
if you had done the right thing......i wouldn't have woken up:::['10-13-232']
feeling stupid and embarrassed.:::['10-13-233']
i would've woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.:::['10-13-234']
well-- oh, stop that!:::['10-13-235']
i can't believe this! i was just being a good guy.:::['10-13-236']
i treated you with respect and understanding.:::['10-13-237']
oh, that is so hot.:::['10-13-238']
hey, i was looking out for you.:::['10-13-239']
oh, really? well, you know what? lam a big girl.:::['10-13-240']
i don't need someone telling me what is best for me.:::['10-13-241']
i gotta say, i've not had sex a lot of times before. this is the worst ever!:::['10-13-242']
oh, oh, really? really? well, it wasn't very good for me either.:::['10-13-243']
oh, okay, you know--? hey, hey, you know what?:::['10-13-244']
to avoid this little thing in the future......let's just say, you and me?:::['10-13-245']
never having sex again.:::['10-13-246']
what? that's right! sex is off the table!:::['10-13-247']
i am never having sex with you again!:::['10-13-248']
dr. green, are you feeling better?:::['10-13-249']
hey! how was lunch? erica: we had a good time.:::['10-13-250']
by the way, i wanted to ask you something.:::['10-13-251']
it would really mean a lot to me if the baby was a boy......that you name him after my father......jiminy billy bob.:::['10-13-252']
oh, really? no! ha, ha.:::['10-13-253']
you were right. that was fun. ha-ha-ha.:::['10-13-254']
i'm gonna go finish packing.:::['10-13-255']
so is she gonna take the test? no, she doesn't have to.:::['10-13-257']
i found out who the father is. oh, god.:::['10-13-258']
it's shovely joe, isn't it'? no, it's not.:::['10-13-259']
erica didn't pay attention in sex ed. class......because the things she did:::['10-13-261']
with that prison guy?:::['10-13-262']
it'd be pretty hard to make a baby that way.:::['10-13-263']
oh, god, what was it? the thing we hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?:::['10-13-264']
the thing we never do.:::['10-13-265']
shovely joe.:::['10-13-266']
whenever you're ready, joey. joey: right. ahem.:::['10-13-267']
i'm sorry, what's going on? dude, come on, french it up.:::['10-13-268']
joey, do you speak french?:::['10-13-269']
you know what? i think this audition is over.:::['10-13-270']
uh, excuse me?:::['10-13-271']
uh, i am régine phalange.:::['10-13-272']
uh, i was passing by when i heard this man speaking......the regional dialect of my:::['10-13-273']
french town of estée lauder.:::['10-13-274']
you really think this man is speaking french?:::['10-13-275']
good job, little buddy.:::['10-13-276']
that was some really good french.:::['10-13-277']
but i think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.:::['10-13-278']
oh, all right, but my french was good? it was great.:::['10-13-279']
oh, ha, ha, see?:::['10-13-280']
emma's down for the night. oh, good.:::['10-13-281']
so, uh, i guess i'm gonna take oh'. okay.:::['10-13-282']
hey, listen, uh, just before you go--:::['10-13-283']
i just wanna say thank you for coming with me.:::['10-13-284']
oh, no problem.:::['10-13-285']
and also, you know, i, uh--:::['10-13-286']
i was thinking about what you said, uh, you know, about the whole sex thing...:::['10-13-287']
probably not a great idea to go down that road again.:::['10-13-288']
thank you. i'm glad you agree.:::['10-13-289']
it's a shame, though. when we did it, it was pretty good.:::['10-13-290']
yeah, that's true.:::['10-13-292', '10-17-294']
hey, um, do you remember that one really great time?:::['10-13-293']
oh, yeah! you know?:::['10-13-294']
it was valentine's day. it was your birthday.:::['10-13-295']
well, i guess that's all in the past now.:::['10-13-297']
not even one more time. not even once.:::['10-13-299']
no matter how much we want it. even if we want it...:::['10-13-300']
...really bad. that's what we decided.:::['10-13-301']
yeah, ha, ha, that's right.:::['10-13-302']
it's kind of hard, though. you know? yeah.:::['10-13-303']
when two people have a connection, you know, that's--:::['10-13-304']
just seems like......such a......waste.:::['10-13-305']
i hate waste.:::['10-13-306']
ross? yes?:::['10-13-307']
just so you know......with us......it's never off the table.:::['10-13-308']
damn it, it's never off the table.:::['10-13-309']
okay, can you really tap-dance? no.:::['10-13-310']
it's off the résumé.:::['10-13-311']
archery? no.:::['10-13-312']
horseback riding? would fall off a lot.:::['10-13-313']
you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?:::['10-13-314']
that i can do.:::['10-13-315']
come on, you can drink a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?:::['10-13-316']
all right, watch me.:::['10-13-317']
okay, you time me, ready? ready, go!:::['10-13-318']

what we have is too important to mess it up over some girl.:::['10-11-54']
i mean, we can get laid any time we want.:::['10-11-55']
i had sex in high school. me too. i'm good at it.:::['10-11-57']

i may have borrowed this from my nephew......but let me assure you,what's underneath is all man.:::['10-11-216']

that didn't make us sound gay at all.:::['10-11-242']
you broke the pact. ross, that was 16 years ago.:::['10-11-243']
that doesn't matter. we're talking about the foundation of our friendship.:::['10-11-244']
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.:::['10-11-245']
if we're really gonna do this, it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.:::['10-11-246']
i didn't. oh, really?:::['10-11-247']

college guys are so cute.:::['10-11-263']
hey, you've got a boyfriend. i know.:::['10-11-264']
but if a guy who looks like corey haim wants to kiss me, i am so gonna let him.:::['10-11-265']
hey, look, there's chandler.:::['10-11-266']
that stupid friend of ross' who said i was fat.:::['10-11-267']
i've already lost four pounds. you can so totally tell.:::['10-11-268']
well, let's see, maybe he knows where ross is.:::['10-11-270']
der kommissar's in town, uh-oh:::['10-11-271']
hey, how's it going?:::['10-11-272', '3-23-148']

don't turn around, uh-oh:::['10-11-284', '10-11-288']
listen, adrienne, you can't tell chandler about this.:::['10-11-285']
oh, believe me, ross, i won't be telling anybody about this.:::['10-11-286']
der kommissar's in town:::['10-11-289']
i didn't know you knew about that.:::['10-11-290']
well, i did. and it hurt.:::['10-11-291']
that's when i wrote the song "betrayal in the common room.":::['10-11-292']
man, i'm sorry.:::['10-11-293']
look, that was a long time ago.:::['10-11-294']
so, i made out with adrienne, and you made out with missy.:::['10-11-295']
well, i guess we're even.:::['10-11-296']
we are even, right?:::['10-11-298']
one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night, i wanted to get back at you.:::['10-11-299']

somebody order a pizza? oh, that's me!:::['10-11-312']
won't you take me to funkytown?:::['10-11-313', '10-11-326']
i am so not gonna do good on my sats tomorrow.:::['10-11-314']
well, maybe you could go to school here next year and we could totally hang out.:::['10-11-315']
oh, yeah. there's a plan.:::['10-11-316']
why don't i just start taking my smart pills now?:::['10-11-317']
well, maybe you could get in on a beauty scholarship.:::['10-11-318']
what a line.:::['10-11-319']
so where are you applying to?:::['10-11-321']
...i think it's kind of really important that i go somewhere where there's sun.:::['10-11-322']
so i'm sort of... hey!:::['10-11-323']
i'm in college and i'm in a band.:::['10-11-324']

you know, it's fine. we'll pay you.:::['10-11-328']
no, no, you're right. who am i kidding?:::['10-11-329']
i should have hung up that breakaway jockstrap years ago.:::['10-11-330']
what am i gonna do? i mean......this has been my life for 32 years.:::['10-11-331']
taking my clothes off in front of people is all i know.:::['10-11-332']
no, there's gotta be something else that you can do.:::['10-11-333']
i mean, what skills do you have?:::['10-11-334']
i can make my pecs dance.:::['10-11-336']
i can pick up a dollar bill with my butt cheeks.:::['10-11-337']
i can go to that special place inside me where i feel no shame.:::['10-11-338']
so maybe something in an office.:::['10-11-339']
or you could... you could teach stripping.:::['10-11-340']
you know, share your gift. pass the torch.:::['10-11-341']
you know, actually, that's not a bad idea.:::['10-11-342']
i could do it out of my apartment. i don't think my mom would mind.:::['10-11-343']
there you go. okay. you think you're gonna be okay?:::['10-11-344']
yeah. yeah, yeah. yeah.:::['10-11-345']

oh, my god. that's wild. but it was, like, a million years ago.:::['10-11-393']
it doesn't matter. it matters to me.:::['10-11-394']
why? because the night you kissed rachel......was the night i kissed rachel:::['10-11-395']
for the very first time.:::['10-11-396']
you kissed her that night too? two guys in one night?:::['10-11-397']

passed out in our room......i went in there to make sure:::['10-11-400']
she was all right.:::['10-11-401']
she was lying on my bed, all buried in people's coats.:::['10-11-402']
i went to kiss her on the forehead......but it was so dark,i accidentally got her lips.:::['10-11-403']
i started to pull away, but then i felt her start to kiss me back.:::['10-11-404']
it was only for a second, but it was amazing.:::['10-11-405']
and now i find out that you kissed her first.:::['10-11-406']

no, you're not. last week, you thought ross was trying to kill you.:::['10-10-31']
well, sorry, but it's hard to believe that anyone would tell a story that dull......just to tell it.:::['10-10-32']
there's something going on with them.:::['10-10-33']
look. he's getting into the car with her.:::['10-10-34']

come to the movies with me and rachel.:::['10-10-41']
oh, uh, i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck here at the office all day.:::['10-10-42']
uh, well, it's a shame that you'll miss the movie......because we were gonna see,you know, either, um, liar liar or, um......betrayal or an affair to remember.:::['10-10-43']
those are all really old.:::['10-10-44']
okay, then maybe it'll be, um...:::['10-10-45']

hey. hey. hi, sweetie.:::['10-10-54']
hey, you smell like perfume and cigarettes.:::['10-10-55']
i was in the car with nancy. nancy doesn't smoke.:::['10-10-56']
well, at least the perfume's not mine. be thankful for that.:::['10-10-57']
so... what did you think of the house?:::['10-10-58']
it's everything we've been looking for.:::['10-10-59']
isn't it? and what about the amazing wainscoting......the crown molding:::['10-10-60']
and the dormer windows in the attic?:::['10-10-61']
and the wiggle woms and the zip zorps.:::['10-10-62']
what were the things you said?:::['10-10-63']
don't you love the huge yard? the fireplace in the bedroom.:::['10-10-64']
and nancy said it's really underpriced......because the guy lost his job:::['10-10-65']
and has to move in with his parents!:::['10-10-66']
this is bringing out a lovely color in you.:::['10-10-67']
so do you think we should get it?:::['10-10-68']
i don't know. what do you think?:::['10-10-69']
i think we should. i do too.:::['10-10-70']
this is huge. i know.:::['10-10-71']
how bad do you wanna smoke now?:::['10-10-72']
i don't know what you mean, giant, talking cigarette.:::['10-10-73']
phoebe called as i was getting into nancy's car.:::['10-10-74']
if she asks you, i was at work all day.:::['10-10-75']
got you. when do we tell them?:::['10-10-76']
we don't. not until it's 100 percent. why upset everybody over nothing?:::['10-10-77']
okay. right.:::['10-10-78']
oh, my god, that is gonna be so hard. i know. good luck with it.:::['10-10-79']
i just can't see chandler cheating.:::['10-10-80']
i'm telling you guys, we followed them out to a house in westchester.:::['10-10-81']
they went in for 45 minutes, and then they came out looking pretty happy.:::['10-10-82']
chandler? rachel: mm-hm.:::['10-10-83']
forty-five minutes?:::['10-10-84']
well, something's not right.:::['10-10-85']
i can't believe he'd do this to monica.:::['10-10-86']
i know, and with the baby coming?:::['10-10-87']
so should we tell her? ross: i don't know.:::['10-10-88']
if one of us saw mike with another woman, would you want us to tell you?:::['10-10-89']
why? who'd you see him with?:::['10-10-90']
no one. i'm just saying if we did... tell me what you know!:::['10-10-91']
no one. nothing. mike's a great guy. it was hypothetical.:::['10-10-92']
all right. he is a good guy.:::['10-10-93']
you're right. he wouldn't cheat.:::['10-10-94']
if i did see him with someone, there's no way i...:::['10-10-95']
who did you see him with?:::['10-10-96']
oh, look at her. so happy.:::['10-10-97']
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one.:::['10-10-98']
hey, is, uh... is chandler here?:::['10-10-99']
no, he's picking up dinner. why, what's up?:::['10-10-100']
look, whatever happens, we're here for you and we love you.:::['10-10-102']
all right. chandler might be having an affair.:::['10-10-103']
what? phoebe and i saw chandler......with a blond woman today:::['10-10-104']
outside on the street.:::['10-10-105']
and then we followed them to a house in westchester.:::['10-10-106']
they went in together. i'm so sorry.:::['10-10-107']
oh, my god. oh, my god, that's awful.:::['10-10-108']
what did you think of the house?:::['10-10-109']
monica, you understand what we're saying, right?:::['10-10-111']
yeah. sure. i mean, i'm devastated, obviously.:::['10-10-112']
did you think the neighborhood was homey?:::['10-10-113']
hey. you son of a bitch.:::['10-10-114']
is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?:::['10-10-115']
phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today.:::['10-10-116']
and, um, they think you're having an affair.:::['10-10-117']
who's nancy? what's going on?:::['10-10-118']
all right, you better sit down.:::['10-10-121']
this is... this is pretty big. yeah.:::['10-10-122']
i'm not having an affair.:::['10-10-123']
nancy is our realtor.:::['10-10-124']
i knew he couldn't be with a woman for 45 minutes.:::['10-10-125']
why do you have a realtor?:::['10-10-126']
um, she's been showing us houses outside of the city.:::['10-10-127']
what? are you serious?:::['10-10-128', '5-12-220', '4-5-180']
when we found out that we were gonna get this baby......chandler and i decided:::['10-10-129']
we didn't wanna raise a kid in the city.:::['10-10-130']
so you're... so you're gonna move?:::['10-10-131']
shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?:::['10-10-133']
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city?:::['10-10-134']
i'm doing it. ross is doing it.:::['10-10-135']
sarah jessica parker is doing it.:::['10-10-136']
and that's great for you guys, but we want a lawn and a swing set.:::['10-10-137']
a street where our kids can ride their bikes......and maybe an ice-cream truck:::['10-10-138']
can go by.:::['10-10-139']
so you wanna buy a house in the '50s.:::['10-10-140']
phoebe: have you thought about what you're giving up?:::['10-10-141']
you can't move out of the city. what if...?:::['10-10-142']
what if you want chinese food at 5 a. m?:::['10-10-143']
or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains?:::['10-10-144']
or an asian hooker sent right to your door?:::['10-10-145']
you know what? if you want to look for a house, that's okay.:::['10-10-146']
no. no, it's not. don't listen to him. i'm gonna thump you.:::['10-10-147']
it's okay, because they have to get it out of their system.:::['10-10-148']
okay? but you're gonna realize this is the only place you wanna be.:::['10-10-149']
actually......we already found a house we love.:::['10-10-150']
what? about an hour ago, we made an offer.:::['10-10-151']
bet you wish i was having an affair now, huh?:::['10-10-152']
you put an offer on a house? it's so sweet.:::['10-10-153']
it really is. it has this big yard that leads down to this stream.:::['10-10-154']
and then there's these old maple trees.:::['10-10-155']
oh, again with the nature. what are you, beavers?:::['10-10-156']
look, i know this is really hard, and we're really sorry.:::['10-10-157']
is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food?:::['10-10-158']
because i can stop doing that.:::['10-10-159']
i really, really think i can.:::['10-10-160']
you know that's not the reason, joe.:::['10-10-161']
monica: i think if you saw it, you'd understand.:::['10-10-162']
you guys were there. it's beautiful, isn't it?:::['10-10-163']
yeah, it is. what the hell are you doing?:::['10-10-164']
well, it is, all right? when we were out there today, all i kept thinking was::::['10-10-165']
"i can't believe chandler is screwing this woman......but, man, this would be:::['10-10-166']
a nice place to live.":::['10-10-167']
yeah, but so is this.:::['10-10-168']
yeah. i mean, if you move there, you have to leave here.:::['10-10-169']
i mean, how can you leave this place?:::['10-10-170']
phoebe: you know what i just realized?:::['10-10-184']
ooh, look. ugly naked guy lit a bunch of candles.:::['10-10-188']
hey, it's your thanksgiving too.:::['10-10-192', '3-9-0']
you know, instead of watching football, you could help.:::['10-10-193', '3-9-1']
we know.:::['10-10-194', '3-9-2']
rachel, you wanna put the marshmallows in concentric circles.:::['10-10-195', '3-9-3']
no, you wanna put them in concentric circles.:::['10-10-196']
i want to do this.:::['10-10-197', '3-9-5']
every year.:::['10-10-198', '3-9-6']
joey: it's stuck.:::['10-10-199']
phoebe: well...:::['10-10-200']
step. how did it get on?:::['10-10-201']
i put it on to scare chandler.:::['10-10-202', '5-8-72']
oh, my god! monica's gonna totally freak out.:::['10-10-203']
plus, it smells really bad in here.:::['10-10-204', '5-8-75']
of course it smells bad. you have your head inside a turkey's ass.:::['10-10-205']
ooh, ooh. monica.:::['10-10-206']
did you get the turkey...? oh, my god! oh, my god!:::['10-10-208']
who is that?:::['10-10-209', '5-8-80']
joey: it's joey.:::['10-10-210', '5-8-81']
how about if we win, they have to get rid of the rooster.:::['10-10-212', '4-12-176']
ooh, that's interesting.:::['10-10-213', '4-12-177']
if you win......we give up the bird.:::['10-10-214']

i thought you were my best friend. this is my sister.:::['10-10-267', '5-15-13']

i cannot believe this.:::['10-10-274', '5-15-19']
this is the last box of your clothes.:::['10-10-275']
i know i said some bad stuff......but rachel does have some qualities:::['10-10-284']
and when i told her i was gonna move in with chandler......she was really supportive.:::['10-10-295']
this isn't exactly the kind of thanksgiving you planned......but for me this has been really great,you know?:::['10-10-306']
i was just thinking, if you'd gone to vail......or if you guys had been with your family,or if you didn't have......syphilis and stuff......we wouldn't be all together, you know?:::['10-10-308']
so i guess what i'm trying to say......is that i'm very thankful:::['10-10-309']
that all of your thanksgivings sucked.:::['10-10-310']
you can't move. you just... you just can't.:::['10-10-317']
rachel's right. this is where you guys belong.:::['10-10-318']
you don't wanna live in westchester. that's the worst of the chesters.:::['10-10-319']
you know, sometimes when i'm alone in my apartment, i look over here......and you guys are just having dinner......or watching tv or something......but it makes me feel better.:::['10-10-320']
and now when i look over, who am i gonna see?:::['10-10-321']
the gottliebs? the yangs?:::['10-10-322']

joey: i'm really sorry, you guys.:::['10-10-335']

mr. campbell's not here yet. let me show you to his table.:::['10-14-68']
oh, my god. that's my boss. you have to seat us somewhere else.:::['10-14-69']

i don't know how it works. my name is buffay......and my husband's name is hannigan.:::['10-14-105']
so is it supposed to be "buffay-hannigan" or "hannigan-buffay"?:::['10-14-106']
it can be anything you want. well, not anything.:::['10-14-107']
yeah. anything.:::['10-14-108']
oh, this could take a while.:::['10-14-109']

well, i didn't get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren.:::['10-14-124']
that is a bad interview.:::['10-14-125']
what are you talking about? how did this happen?:::['10-14-126']
my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview......and he heard everything.:::['10-14-127']
later, he calls me into his office and tells me he'll have to let me go......because i'm not a team player.:::['10-14-128']
and i said, "wait a minute. yes, i am.":::['10-14-129']
and then i had to sit there for 45 minutes......while he proved that:::['10-14-130']
that, in fact, was true.:::['10-14-131']
oh, god, i'm so sorry. god.:::['10-14-132']

and to years of hard work finally paying off.:::['10-14-150']
and to knowing that your career doesn't mean everything.:::['10-14-151']
but also knowing it means a lot.:::['10-14-152']
but more importantly, to full, well-rounded lives.:::['10-14-153']
that center around work.:::['10-14-154']
to ross. ross: to ross.:::['10-14-155']
you know what the best part about this is? i can never be fired.:::['10-14-156']

oh, look at you. look how happy you are for me.:::['10-14-160']
no, it's not that. i got fired today.:::['10-14-161']

oh, my-- rach, i'm so sorry. oh...:::['10-14-163']

okay. then i guess i have dry eyes and a scratchy throat for no reason.:::['10-14-176']
maybe it's because you hung your head out the window like a dog......the whole ride here.:::['10-14-177']
so this is the living room, huh? it's pretty dark.:::['10-14-179']
no, it's not. are you kidding?:::['10-14-180']
i think i just saw a bat in the corner.:::['10-14-181']
when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?:::['10-14-182']
look, i just think you guys can do better than this house, you know?:::['10-14-184']
or any other house for that matter.:::['10-14-185']
oh, joey.:::['10-14-186', '5-19-341']

man, those two dogs are going at it.:::['10-14-277']
hey. where you been? oh, just, uh, you know, looking around.:::['10-14-279']
but you know what?:::['10-14-280', '2-18-124', '5-18-242']
this house is great.:::['10-14-281']
really? what changed your mind?:::['10-14-282']
the little girl who lives here made me feel better about the whole thing.:::['10-14-283']
joey? there was a little girl who lived here, but she died, like, 30 years ago.:::['10-14-284']
i'm just messing with you.:::['10-14-286']
that's not funny. you know i'm afraid of little-girl ghosts.:::['10-14-287']
joey, now that you're okay with the house, do you want to go see your room?:::['10-14-288']
i get my own room?:::['10-14-290']
you don't think we'd buy a house and not have a joey room, do you?:::['10-14-291']
hey, can i have an aquarium? and a sex swing?:::['10-14-293']
both: no. why not? i'll keep the tank clean.:::['10-14-294']

okay, i will. this is, uh-- this is my husband, crap bag.:::['10-14-303']
crap bag?:::['10-14-304']
if you need an easy way to remember it, just think of a bag of crap.:::['10-14-305']
okay. excuse me. yeah.:::['10-14-306']
ugh. okay, fine, you made your point. can you please just be mike hannigan again?:::['10-14-307']

hey, is rachel here? monica: nope.:::['10-14-316']
she's still at dinner?:::['10-14-317']
i guess. why, who's she with? that guy, mark......from bloomingdale's.:::['10-14-318']
she thinks he's just being nice to her.:::['10-14-319']
but i know he really wants to sleep with her.:::['10-14-320']
it's seven years ago.:::['10-14-321']
my time machine works.:::['10-14-322']
we ran into him on the street today, and he said he might have a job for her.:::['10-14-323']
but i know he just wants to get into her pants.:::['10-14-324']
so, what if he wants to sleep with her? i mean, she's single, and he's cute.:::['10-14-325']
yesterday, on the subway, you couldn't stop staring......at that woman with the big breasts.:::['10-14-328']

the job is in paris.:::['10-14-346', '10-15-3']
i mean, this soap opera is a great gig......but am i missing opportunities?:::['10-14-347']
you know, i've always thought of myself as a serious actor.:::['10-14-348']
should i be trying to do more independent movies?:::['10-14-349']
but you know what? i'm gonna put you on with my bear.:::['10-14-351']
hey, bailey, i need some career advice.:::['10-14-353']
how did the job stuff go? he offered me one!:::['10-15-1']
you know what? this calls for a bottle of israel's finest!:::['10-15-2']
oh, god, please, somebody say something.:::['10-15-4']
so if you take this job, you'll be moving to paris?:::['10-15-5']
or facing a bitch of a commute.:::['10-15-6']
i know, it's huge, and it's scary and it's really far, far away from you guys.:::['10-15-7']
but this is such an incredible opportunity for me.:::['10-15-8']
and i've already told them about our situation with emma.:::['10-15-9']
and they said they'll do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable.:::['10-15-10']
i mean, i'll fly back and forth, they'll fly you out. anything we want.:::['10-15-12']
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle.:::['10-15-13']
all right. we'll work it out. rachel: oh, thank you. thank you.:::['10-15-14']
you sure this is what you want? i think it is.:::['10-15-16']
what's going on? i got a really incredible job offer.:::['10-15-17']
hey, great! all right! good for you!:::['10-15-18']
it's in paris. what?:::['10-15-19']
no, no, no! no, no, no! no, no, too much is changing, okay?:::['10-15-20']
first phoebe getting married. congratulations.:::['10-15-21']
and then these two move in to a stupid house in the stupid suburbs.:::['10-15-22']
earlier, you said you'd be supportive. it comes and goes. i wouldn't trust it.:::['10-15-23']
you guys, this is really, really important to me.:::['10-15-24']
it means a lot if you could try to get on board.:::['10-15-25']
of course we can. congratulations. yay! rachel: thank you.:::['10-15-26']
joey? no,no.no.:::['10-15-27']
no, my hugs are reserved for people staying in america.:::['10-15-28']
joey, it would mean-- hey!:::['10-15-29']
no! get your france-going arms away from me!:::['10-15-30']
rachel joey.:::['10-15-31']
are you okay with this? well, it makes me feel sad, but--:::['10-15-32']
talking to ross. i see.:::['10-15-33']
rachel moving to another country? not being able to see her every day?:::['10-15-34']
how could i be okay with this? monica: i know.:::['10-15-35']
but what are we gonna do? she really needs this job.:::['10-15-36']
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back... ...she would take it?:::['10-15-37']
how's that gonna happen?:::['10-15-38']
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?:::['10-15-39']
like, i don't know, i could talk to her boss. yeah.:::['10-15-40']
i met him at that christmas party. i mean, we really hit it off.:::['10-15-41']
the guy who kept calling you "ron"? i didn't say we were brothers!:::['10-15-42']
hey, phoebe. hey, tell me what you think.:::['10-15-43']
the house next door to the one that we're buying just went on the market.:::['10-15-44']
i wanna take a look at it, but chandler doesn't.:::['10-15-45']
we close escrow tomorrow.:::['10-15-46']
seeing another house can only confuse us. we're easily confused.:::['10-15-47']
we're not very bright.:::['10-15-48']
but what if it's better than ours? shouldn't we look?:::['10-15-49']
what do you think, pheebs?:::['10-15-50']
well, i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin-robbins.:::['10-15-51']
hey, isn't joey's agent estelle leonard? yeah.:::['10-15-53']
she died. you're kidding.:::['10-15-54']
that's terrible. yeah, last saturday.:::['10-15-55']
wow! she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic.:::['10-15-56']
oh, wait a minute, i read the wrong one. oh, yeah?:::['10-15-57']
yeah, she was just an agent. joey's gonna be so upset.:::['10-15-58']
i know. he always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic.:::['10-15-59']
we cannot tell joey about this.:::['10-15-60']
he's already flipping out about everything that's changing.:::['10-15-61']
this will push him over the edge.:::['10-15-62']
you don't think we should tell him? not for a while.:::['10-15-63']
let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else.:::['10-15-64']
what if he reads it in the paper?:::['10-15-65']
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay.:::['10-15-66']
may i help you? yeah. i'm a friend of rachel green's.:::['10-15-67']
um, actually, we met at the christmas party about two years ago.:::['10-15-68']
oh, right. don? close. ron.:::['10-15-69']
well, what can i do for you?:::['10-15-70']
um, well, i'm here to see if you'll give rachel her job back.:::['10-15-71']
ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?:::['10-15-72']
no. first i have to get you to agree......then we'll see:::['10-15-73']
if she wants to come back.:::['10-15-74']
wow, that is tempting.:::['10-15-75']
she loved her job here. let's face it you're not gonna find anyone......who did it as well as she did.:::['10-15-76']
isn't that true?:::['10-15-77']
she is good. huh. i took a shot there.:::['10-15-78']
but i'm sorry, there's nothing i can do.:::['10-15-79']
oh, that's not true. there's nothing i want to do.:::['10-15-80']
thanks very much. mm-hm.:::['10-15-82']
is this your son? yeah, his name is ross.:::['10-15-83']
what? nothing, it's just that it's close to ron.:::['10-15-84']
does he, um--? does little ross like dinosaurs, by any chance?:::['10-15-85']
yeah, they're all he talks about. why?:::['10-15-86']
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history......after everyone else has left,just the two of us......and he can touch anything he wants?:::['10-15-87']
i just heard it how you must have heard it, and that's not good.:::['10-15-88']
let me start again. i'm a paleontologist.:::['10-15-89']
you'll be there with us, and the touching refers only to bones-- fossils!:::['10-15-90']
you could really arrange that? you let rachel come back and it's done.:::['10-15-91']
well, i guess having rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.:::['10-15-92']
yes! thank you! this is great! thank you so much.:::['10-15-93']
i swear, your kid's gonna have the time of his life.:::['10-15-94']
that's great. i worry about little ross.:::['10-15-95']
he's always reading, collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.:::['10-15-96']
he'll be fine!:::['10-15-97']
everything okay? i'm just mad at my agent.:::['10-15-99']
estelle? why?:::['10-15-100']
there's a part in this tv movie that i would be perfect for......and i didn't even get put up for it.:::['10-15-101']
she better have a good reason.:::['10-15-102']
i'm guessing she does.:::['10-15-103']
well, i wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this.:::['10-15-104']
no, wait, wait, wait! all right, i gotta go.:::['10-15-105']
just listen. promise me that you will wait a minute before you call her.:::['10-15-106']
well, okay. why?:::['10-15-107']
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.:::['10-15-108']
i love that saying!:::['10-15-109']
i was just gonna call you. that's weird.:::['10-15-111']
it's a little coincidental, but believable.:::['10-15-112']
listen, i'm sure you're wondering why i didn't get you......an audition for that tv movie.:::['10-15-113']
yeah, actually i am.:::['10-15-114']
i guess i dropped the ball there. whoopsie!:::['10-15-115']
that's it? you know, it seems like all you do lately is drop the ball.:::['10-15-116']
don't take that tone with me. who do you think you are?:::['10-15-117']
alan lemon, the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic?:::['10-15-118']
no, look, all i'm saying is you're my agent......and you're not getting me:::['10-15-119']
any auditions and i'm tired of it.:::['10-15-120']
i'm saying that this isn't working for me anymore, okay, estelle?:::['10-15-122']
you're fired. goodbye.:::['10-15-123']
man, tough week for estelle.:::['10-15-124']
um, emma left her stuffed t. rex at my house.:::['10-15-126']
you know she can't sleep without it. ah. well, she's asleep now.:::['10-15-127']
stop forcing that thing on her. okay.:::['10-15-128']
oh! you're not gonna believe what happened to me today!:::['10-15-129']
ralph lauren called and gave me my job back.:::['10-15-130']
no! i mean, it was the weirdest thing.:::['10-15-131']
they fire me and then out of nowhere, they just hire me back.:::['10-15-132']
i mean, that place must just be falling apart without me!:::['10-15-133']
so you're not going to paris? no, i'm still going.:::['10-15-134']
well, when the louis vuitton people found out......that ralph lauren wanted me back,they offered me more money!:::['10-15-136']
ross, isn't that great?:::['10-15-137']
hi. we're buying the house next door... ...and we were wondering if we could take a look around?:::['10-15-139']
i'm showing it to someone else, but please, look around.:::['10-15-140']
i feel like we're cheating on our house.:::['10-15-142']
if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with a hot, younger house......that does stuff:::['10-15-143']
that our house won't do?:::['10-15-144']
ours is so much better.:::['10-15-145']
this living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave.:::['10-15-146']
what a hole!:::['10-15-147']
so, what do you think? loveit:::['10-15-148']
we already have one offer. i think the lady upstairs is gonna make another one.:::['10-15-149']
they could be our neighbors. what are they like?:::['10-15-150']
the woman upstairs is nice. she and her husband have two kids.:::['10-15-151']
uh, he's on wall street, and she's a-- oh, my god!:::['10-15-152']
hey, joey, you wanna come with me to--?:::['10-15-154']
yeah, i just feel bad about firing estelle.:::['10-15-156']
this has gotta be killing her.:::['10-15-157']
no, that wouldn't kill her.:::['10-15-158']
a coronary embolism might.:::['10-15-159']
i don't know. she's gotta be taking it hard. i was, like, her only client.:::['10-15-160']
except for this guy who eats paper.:::['10-15-161']
and i'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.:::['10-15-162']
look, i know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for 10 years.:::['10-15-163']
i'm gonna call her and hire her again. no, no, no! don't call her.:::['10-15-164']
you wait for her to call you. why?:::['10-15-165']
because patience is the road to understanding.:::['10-15-166']
which is the key to a happy heart.:::['10-15-167']
you blow me away.:::['10-15-168']
all right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?:::['10-15-169']
i promise. okay.:::['10-15-170']
and that means never having to give a reason.:::['10-15-171']
what a small world!:::['10-15-172']
and yet i never run into beyoncé.:::['10-15-173']
you two know each other?:::['10-15-174']
oh, we go way back. before monica made an honest man out of him......chandler used to be:::['10-15-175']
my little love muffin.:::['10-15-176']
so are you guys thinking of getting this house too?:::['10-15-177']
are we gonna have a bidding war? i better warn you, i'm a toughie.:::['10-15-178']
don't. don't. don't.:::['10-15-179']
no, actually, we are buying the house next door.:::['10-15-180']
i don't know why.:::['10-15-182']
oh, that decides it, then! i was on the fence.:::['10-15-183']
but knowing that you two would be our neighbors?:::['10-15-184']
now we have to get it.:::['10-15-185']
ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.:::['10-15-186']
this cannot be happening.:::['10-15-187']
okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer.:::['10-15-188']
maybe the janices won't get it! maybe the other couple will.:::['10-15-189']
the only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the hitlers!:::['10-15-190']
okay, okay! all right, what if we get both houses?:::['10-15-191']
we can turn this one into a guesthouse! that's a great idea!:::['10-15-192']
by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful......but when did you start:::['10-15-193']
crapping money?:::['10-15-194']
you come up with an idea. all right.:::['10-15-195']
we've still got three hours till escrow closes on our house.:::['10-15-196']
we can still get out. but we love our house.:::['10-15-197']
will we love it so much with her next door?:::['10-15-198']
and she's gonna be louder out here too!:::['10-15-199']
just the crickets and, "oh, my god!":::['10-15-200']
okay. but if we don't get this house, she's still gonna show up wherever we go.:::['10-15-201']
at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise.:::['10-15-202']
never again will you have to hear the three words......that make your balls jump back up:::['10-15-203']
inside your body!:::['10-15-204']
well, we have to do something. we can't have her living next door.:::['10-15-205']
oh, that does it too.:::['10-15-206']
it's me. ron.:::['10-15-208']
look, i know rachel turned you down......but i think there's a way you might:::['10-15-209']
be able to get her to come back.:::['10-15-210']
this may surprise you, but rehiring fired employees is not my main job.:::['10-15-211']
just hear me out.:::['10-15-212']
how would you feel about offering her a raise?:::['10-15-213']
not good, ron.:::['10-15-214']
perhaps i can persuade you.:::['10-15-215']
what if you could give your son......this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.:::['10-15-216']
wow. that's pretty cool.:::['10-15-217']
huh? so? do we have a deal?:::['10-15-218']
qkay, you got it. yes! yes!:::['10-15-219']
this is gonna make me very popular. oh.:::['10-15-220']
believe me, the ladies, they love it.:::['10-15-221']
i meant with my son.:::['10-15-222']
good, because the ladies, not so much.:::['10-15-223']
joey, this is ai zebooker... ...the guy who eats paper.:::['10-15-224']
i'm sure you've heard that estelle passed away.:::['10-15-225']
i wanted to let you know there's a memorial for her......at the westside chapel tomorrow at 10.:::['10-15-226']
hope you can make it.:::['10-15-227']
estelle?:::['10-15-230']
yeah, i wanted to call and tell you that there's no hard feelings for firing me.:::['10-15-231']
okay. i just-- i can't believe you're calling me.:::['10-15-232']
i didn't think i should just drop by.:::['10-15-233']
no, no! don't drop by! don't drop by!:::['10-15-234']
no.no.no.:::['10-15-235']
anyway, you did what you had to do. i'm okay.:::['10-15-236']
can i ask you something? um...:::['10-15-237']
what's it like there?:::['10-15-238']
it's all right.:::['10-15-239']
look, kiddo, i gotta go.:::['10-15-240']
good luck with the career. you're gonna be huge!:::['10-15-241']
thanks for everything, estelle. bye.:::['10-15-242']
"out of area." boy, i'll say.:::['10-15-243']
well, i just talked to sid.:::['10-15-244']
we are definitely putting in an offer on the house.:::['10-15-245']
and i'll bet we get it!:::['10-15-246']
the hitlers will be so disappointed.:::['10-15-247']
all right, i gotta run. tell monica i say goodbye.:::['10-15-248']
and i'll see you later, neighbor. ha, ha.:::['10-15-249']
i just want you to know that i'm so happy you're going to be here.:::['10-15-251']
oh, me too.:::['10-15-252', '5-16-13']
because......that way......we can pick up where we left off.:::['10-15-253']
huh? i never stopped loving you.:::['10-15-254']
oh, my-- yeah, yeah, yeah.:::['10-15-255']
i want you.:::['10-15-256']
i need you.:::['10-15-257']
i must have you, janice litman-goralnik neé hosenstein.:::['10-15-258']
chandler, what are you talking about?:::['10-15-259']
now that you live next door, we can be together every day.:::['10-15-260']
sid and monica never have to know a thing.:::['10-15-261']
i don't know what to say.:::['10-15-262', '2-11-180', '2-4-224', '3-13-286']
i mean, you know, obviously we have this heat between us.:::['10-15-263']
obviously.:::['10-15-264']
but i love my husband.:::['10-15-265']
and i know you love your wife.:::['10-15-266']
i don't think we should get this house now.:::['10-15-267']
don't say that. don't dangle the dream and take it away.:::['10-15-268']
chandler, one of us has got to be strong.:::['10-15-269']
although...:::['10-15-271']
maybe just one last moment of weakness.:::['10-15-272']
goodbye, chandler bing.:::['10-15-273', '3-8-323']
they're never coming down now!:::['10-15-274']
hi. hi!:::['10-15-275']
you are never going to believe what happened to me today.:::['10-15-276']
ralph lauren called, again, and they offered me more money.:::['10-15-278']
they did? yes! it was the weirdest thing.:::['10-15-279']
zelner called me and said, "we will do anything we can to get you back.":::['10-15-280']
and that i should thank some "ron.":::['10-15-281']
i don't even know what department that guy's in!:::['10-15-282']
so, what are you gonna do? well, i took it!:::['10-15-283']
that's great! so you're staying in new york!:::['10-15-284']
you're excited, right? yeah. yeah, you know-- look, the money's great.:::['10-15-285']
it's certainly the easier choice. right.:::['10-15-286']
but, you know, i mean, was i looking forward to going to paris? sure.:::['10-15-287']
you know, was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?:::['10-15-288']
oh, absolutely.:::['10-15-289']
yeah, but you know, this is...:::['10-15-291']
it's fine. i'm fine going back to a job where i've pretty much......gotten everything out of it:::['10-15-292']
that i possibly can.:::['10-15-293']
um, i had really--:::['10-15-294']
i had no idea you were so excited about paris.:::['10-15-295']
um, i mean, you said you were scared.:::['10-15-296']
well, yeah, i mean, it was "good" scared, though, you know?:::['10-15-297']
i mean, like "when i moved to new york" scared.:::['10-15-298']
or, uh, "when i found out i was gonna have emma" scared.:::['10-15-299']
but this is fine. this is gonna be good.:::['10-15-300']
you should go.:::['10-15-301']
it's what you want. you should go.:::['10-15-303']
but i already told zelner that i would come back.:::['10-15-306']
i'm sure he'll understand.:::['10-15-307']
all right. all right! i'm gonna do it. i'm gonna go to paris.:::['10-15-308']
i'm going to paris!:::['10-15-310']
thank you, ross. yeah, yeah.:::['10-15-311']
oh, i'm so happy-:::['10-15-313']
then i'm happy too.:::['10-15-314']
thank you all for coming.:::['10-15-315']
we're here today to pay our respects to a wonderful agent......and a beautiful woman.:::['10-15-316']
inside.:::['10-15-317']
as estelle's only two clients, we would like to say a few words.:::['10-15-318']
dude, where's my speech?:::['10-15-319']
that is entertaining. al zebooker, everybody!:::['10-15-320']
ross: hey. hey.:::['10-9-1']
we're here to say goodbye. we're off to ohio.:::['10-9-2']
oh, right, your adoption interview.:::['10-9-3']
yep. we'll meet the lady who could be carrying our baby.:::['10-9-4']
i can't believe it. when you come back, you'll have a baby. that is so weird.:::['10-9-5']
and so incorrect.:::['10-9-6']
she's only a couple months pregnant.:::['10-9-7']
she liked our application, who knows if she'll like us.:::['10-9-8']
oh, come on, she's gonna love you guys.:::['10-9-9']
oh, thank you. but we're trying not to get our hopes up.:::['10-9-10']
a lot could still get in our way.:::['10-9-11']
she could decide against adoption, like another couple better.:::['10-9-12']
what are you gonna name it?:::['10-9-13']
i could develop a condition in which i talk and talk, and no one hears a word.:::['10-9-14']
but just think, okay? what if everything goes right?:::['10-9-15']
what if this woman does pick you guys?:::['10-9-16']
oh, my god. she's gonna pick us!:::['10-9-17']
so we're standing firm on "not getting our hopes up"?:::['10-9-18']
no. i know things could still go wrong, but if they don't......if this works out,we're gonna have a baby. a baby!:::['10-9-19']
yes. but... oh, my god. it's gonna work!:::['10-9-20']
we're gonna make it work!:::['10-9-21']
i'm gonna be a mommy and you're gonna be a daddy!:::['10-9-22']
all right, i'll see you suckers. i'm gonna go get me a baby!:::['10-9-23']
oh, screw it. i'm gonna be a daddy!:::['10-9-24']
hey, who's phoebe with?:::['10-9-25']

no. don't you get any ideas.:::['10-9-29']
i'm not setting you up with any more of my friends.:::['10-9-30']
why? why? because you'll date her once......sleep with her, then forget she exists.:::['10-9-31']
oh! name one friend of yours i did that with.:::['10-9-32']
mandy. mandy, huh? uh...:::['10-9-33']
really hot blond, big boobs?:::['10-9-34']
no. might be why i don't remember her, huh?:::['10-9-35']
do you think i'm someone else?:::['10-9-36']
okay, look, i may not have treated your friends well in the past.:::['10-9-37']
but i have grown up a lot. really. honest. rach?:::['10-9-38']
yeah, believe it or not, it's true.:::['10-9-39']
i mean, when joey and i were together......he was wonderful.:::['10-9-40']
he was thoughtful and mature.:::['10-9-41']
and for the one week that we went out......he didn't sleep with anybody else.:::['10-9-42']
growth.:::['10-9-43']
fine, i'll give you her number. joey: okay. thank you.:::['10-9-44']
and i promise you i will not forget this one.:::['10-9-45']
mandy. sarah!:::['10-9-46']
sarah.:::['10-9-47']
hey. hey, guys, i need some fashion advice.:::['10-9-49']
rachel: oh. huh.:::['10-9-50']

well, it's... it's a little low. pick it up a little.:::['10-9-52']
a little bit more.:::['10-9-53']
now throw it away.:::['10-9-55']
come on! this looks good.:::['10-9-56']
ross, please trust me. i buy 30 fashion magazines a month.:::['10-9-57']
now, i don't know who's running for president or who that nato guy is......but i do know that you:::['10-9-58']
have to get far away from that hat.:::['10-9-59']
damn it. god...:::['10-9-60']
i have this date tomorrow night, and i have to look cool.:::['10-9-61']
if you want fashion help, rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow.:::['10-9-62']
you're welcome to come with us. really? that would be great.:::['10-9-63']
uh, i mean, i have to do something.:::['10-9-64']
she kind of teased me about how i dress.:::['10-9-65']
i can see why. nice shirt. ha, ha.:::['10-9-66']
you're wearing the same shirt.:::['10-9-67']
stupid gap on every corner!:::['10-9-68']
make yourselves comfortable, and i'll be back with erica.:::['10-9-69']
monica: okay, thank you.:::['10-9-70']
well, this is it.:::['10-9-71']
are you okay? yeah, it's just weird, you know?:::['10-9-72']
it's like, uh, "hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?":::['10-9-73']
you're gonna be great.:::['10-9-75']
well, obviously.:::['10-9-76']
monica? chandler? i'd like you to meet erica.:::['10-9-77']
hi. hi. it is so, so nice to meet you.:::['10-9-78']
hi. thank you for agreeing to see us.:::['10-9-79']
hi. i'll let you get acquainted.:::['10-9-80']
chandler: okay. so it's monica and chandler?:::['10-9-81']
i only know you as "file crw33815-d.":::['10-9-82']
that's what our friends call us.:::['10-9-83']
gosh, you know, you're just such an amazing couple. it's......kind of intimidating.:::['10-9-84']
oh, ha, ha. i don't know about that.:::['10-9-85']
are you kidding me? i mean, it's enough that you're a doctor.:::['10-9-86']
but on top of it, you're married to a reverend?:::['10-9-87']
i don't think that's exactly... let her finish, doctor.:::['10-9-88']
oh, my friend sarah had a great time last night.:::['10-9-90']
yeah. yeah, so you gonna call this one back?:::['10-9-91']
ha, ha. no.:::['10-9-92']
what are you talking about? sarah's great.:::['10-9-93']
oh, really? you wanna know what your "great" friend did?:::['10-9-94']
we were out to dinner, okay?:::['10-9-95']
we were getting along, having a really nice time.:::['10-9-96']
i was thinking she was really cool.:::['10-9-97']
and then, out of nowhere...:::['10-9-98']
that's why you won't go out with her again?:::['10-9-100']
so she took some fries. big deal.:::['10-9-101']
hey, look, it's not about a few fries.:::['10-9-102']
it's about what the fries represent.:::['10-9-103']
what? all food!:::['10-9-104']
i can't believe i set you up with such a monster!:::['10-9-106']
hey, hey, hey, look, i take a girl out......she can order whatever she wants.:::['10-9-107']
the more the better, all right?:::['10-9-108']
just don't order a garden salad and then eat my food!:::['10-9-109']
that's a good way to lose some fingers.:::['10-9-110']
phoebe: oh, thank god you're here. listen to this. what?:::['10-9-111']
joey and my friend are out last night, having dinner, and she reaches over......and takes a few of his fries...:::['10-9-112']
joey: mm-hm. what?:::['10-9-114']
you know about the plate thing?:::['10-9-115']
oh, yeah, yeah. no, joey doesn't share food.:::['10-9-116']
i mean, just last week we were having breakfast......and he had a couple grapes:::['10-9-117']
on his plate.:::['10-9-118']
you wouldn't let her have a grape? oh, no, not me.:::['10-9-119']
joey doesn't share food!:::['10-9-121', '10-9-379']
well, i still think that is a stupid reason not to call someone again.:::['10-9-122']
you are calling her, okay?:::['10-9-123']
and if you need to, then just get an extra plate of fries for the table.:::['10-9-124']
i like that.:::['10-9-125', '5-9-142', '4-7-43', '3-3-315']
a sharing buffer. yeah.:::['10-9-126']
yeah, i'll order some extra fries. maybe a plate of onion rings.:::['10-9-127']
and a shrimp cocktail.:::['10-9-129']
uh-huh. and some buffalo wings.:::['10-9-130']
maybe... maybe an individual pizza, huh?:::['10-9-131']
and some mozzarella sticks.:::['10-9-132']
what were we talking about?:::['10-9-133']
wow, this place is awesome.:::['10-9-134']
we should just go. i'm not gonna find anything here.:::['10-9-135']
this stuff is ridiculous.:::['10-9-136']
oh, this place is great!:::['10-9-137']
rach, come on, i'm not gonna wear any of this. nothing silver.:::['10-9-139']
wha...? okay, nothing with hair.:::['10-9-140']
and nothing with padlocks on it! aw.:::['10-9-141']
ross, look. look, i know that some of this stuff is out there.:::['10-9-142']
but, i mean, come on, look at this. look at this sweater.:::['10-9-143']
i mean, this is just beautiful.:::['10-9-144']
wow, this is really soft.:::['10-9-145']
three hundred and fifty dollars?:::['10-9-146']
down from 700. you're saving like 200 bucks.:::['10-9-147']
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today.:::['10-9-148']
hey, check this out. it's totally you.:::['10-9-149']
wow. yeah.:::['10-9-150', '4-8-134']
wow. actually, this looks pretty good.:::['10-9-152']
"boys will be boys"?:::['10-9-154']
what? they will be! all right.:::['10-9-155']
that's it, i'm getting out of here. rachel: no, ross, wait, come on.:::['10-9-156']
there's other stuff here. there's some nice shirts, these nice pants.:::['10-9-157']
huh. actually, these might look pretty good on me.:::['10-9-158']
yes, they will. you know what you should do? go take a walk.:::['10-9-159']
i know your size, and i'm gonna pick out some really good stuff for you.:::['10-9-160']
i know what looks sexy on guys.:::['10-9-162']
just wear what i suggest, and she is gonna go nuts for you.:::['10-9-163']
so you're saying, uh......if i wear these pants,i might be getting into hers?:::['10-9-164']
why do men keep talking to me like this?:::['10-9-165']
so the fact that i'm a doctor and my wife's a reverend......that's important to you?:::['10-9-166']
yeah. i read some great applications......but i thought, "who better:::['10-9-167']
than a minister to raise a child?":::['10-9-168']
amen.:::['10-9-169']
plus, i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor.:::['10-9-170']
oh, good hands.:::['10-9-171']
healing hands.:::['10-9-172']
reverend, can i ask? does the bible say anything about adoption?:::['10-9-173']
it says, "do it.":::['10-9-174']
"and behold, she did adopt unto them a baby.:::['10-9-175']
and it was good.":::['10-9-176']
wow. yeah, wow.:::['10-9-177']
i was wondering... you both have such serious jobs.:::['10-9-178']
would you have time to take care of a baby and your flock?:::['10-9-179']
oh, no, my flock? my flock is good.:::['10-9-180']
yeah. my flock pretty much takes care of themselves by this point.:::['10-9-181']
it's a good flock. flock, flock, flock.:::['10-9-182']
but being a doctor, that must take up a lot of time.:::['10-9-183']
not for me it doesn't.:::['10-9-184']
so how's everything going in here?:::['10-9-185']
we're great. i think i may have asked all my questions.:::['10-9-186']
good. do you have questions for erica?:::['10-9-187']
yeah, actually. so you read a file that you liked......and then you gave the agency:::['10-9-188']
the serial number and they contacted us?:::['10-9-189']
oh, yes. our system ensures total anonymity.:::['10-9-190']
we're very proud of it. you should be.:::['10-9-191']
you're really on top of stuff.:::['10-9-192']
well, then if there's nothing else, then the two of us should talk.:::['10-9-193']
i actually...:::['10-9-194']
i don't think we have to. we don't?:::['10-9-195']
yeah, when i read about you two, i was pretty sure i wanted you......but i just thought we should meet:::['10-9-196']
face to face.:::['10-9-197']
i've made my decision.:::['10-9-198']
i choose them. heh.:::['10-9-199']
oh, my god, this is great.:::['10-9-200']
this is so great. did you hear that?:::['10-9-201']
yeah, i did.:::['10-9-202']
thank you. thank you so much. oh. erica: ha, ha.:::['10-9-204']
oh. you are so going to heaven!:::['10-9-205']
oh, we got some really great stuff. yeah.:::['10-9-206']
yeah, but i'm not sure about some of the bras i got.:::['10-9-207']
oh, really? do you wanna try some of them on for me?:::['10-9-208']
wait, are we in joey's imagination?:::['10-9-210']
oh, no. i took one of ross' bags by mistake.:::['10-9-211']
and one of mine is missing.:::['10-9-212']
ross probably has it. you'll get it from him later.:::['10-9-213']
i think we're not wearing the same shirt anymore.:::['10-9-215']
yeah. yeah, rachel picked it out for me.:::['10-9-216']
she told me to trust her, and you know what? i'm glad i did.:::['10-9-217']
i turned quite a few heads on my way over here.:::['10-9-218']
dude, i really don't think you should be wearing that.:::['10-9-219']
somebody's afraid of a little competition with the ladies?:::['10-9-221']
looks like someone is the ladies!:::['10-9-222']
you're just jealous because you couldn't pull this off.:::['10-9-223']
yeah. now if you'll excuse me, i have a date.:::['10-9-224']
see? all eyes on me!:::['10-9-225']
we are not signing those papers. why not?:::['10-9-226']
it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.:::['10-9-227']
god works in mysterious ways.:::['10-9-228']
you have gotta stop.:::['10-9-229']
but she liked us.:::['10-9-230']
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.:::['10-9-231']
if you think about it, i'm kind of like a reverend.:::['10-9-232']
i mean, as a chef, i serve god by feeding the hungry and poor.:::['10-9-233']
your veal chop is 34.95.:::['10-9-234']
come on, i just... i think we've been given an opportunity.:::['10-9-235']
the mistake's already made. they're writing up the papers now.:::['10-9-236']
but we're not the ones she chose.:::['10-9-237']
how can you feel okay about this?:::['10-9-238']
we may not be who she thinks we are......but no one will ever:::['10-9-240']
love that baby more than us.:::['10-9-241']
i know. i mean, who knows......how long it's gonna take:::['10-9-242']
for someone else to give us a baby?:::['10-9-243']
what if no one ever picks us?:::['10-9-244']
oh, honey...:::['10-9-245', '10-16-203']
please. we are so close.:::['10-9-247']
monica, i want a baby too.:::['10-9-248']
but this woman is giving away her child.:::['10-9-249']
she deserves to know who it's going to.:::['10-9-250']
okay. you're right.:::['10-9-251', '5-1-86']
so we'll tell the truth.:::['10-9-252']
and who knows, you know? maybe she'll like us for us.:::['10-9-253']
maybe she will.:::['10-9-254']
oh, why couldn't i have been a reverend?:::['10-9-255']
you're jewish.:::['10-9-256']
technicality!:::['10-9-257']
garden salad for the lady.:::['10-9-258']
oh, that looks great. good ordering. sarah: ha-ha-ha.:::['10-9-259']
seafood platter for the gentleman, and extra fries.:::['10-9-260']
enjoy. ha, ha.:::['10-9-261']
mm. those fries look delicious.:::['10-9-262']
oh, i didn't know you liked french fries. ha, ha.:::['10-9-263']
help yourself. what's mine is yours.:::['10-9-264']
oh. wow, are those stuffed clams?:::['10-9-265']
yes, they are my stuffed clams.:::['10-9-267']
how about those fries, though, huh?:::['10-9-268']
they are delicious. ha-ha-ha. yeah.:::['10-9-269']
you are beautiful, you know that?:::['10-9-270']
okay, then.:::['10-9-272', '5-9-119', '5-4-242']
now look what you did!:::['10-9-275']
what? what is the matter with you?:::['10-9-276']
i don't like it when people take food off of my plate, okay?:::['10-9-277']
but you said, "what's mine is yours.":::['10-9-278']
well, i didn't mean it!:::['10-9-279']
fine. sorry, i didn't think it was that big a deal.:::['10-9-280']
no, i'm sorry. i...:::['10-9-281']
i'm overreacting, okay? it's just, when it comes to food, i......have certain rules......okay? i mean......there are things you do, and,you know, things that you don't do.:::['10-9-282']
wow, this place looks great.:::['10-9-283']
oh, you are gonna love it. and i'm so glad we're finally doing this.:::['10-9-284']
me too. here.:::['10-9-285']
so this was fun.:::['10-9-286']
i really am sorry about, you know, before.:::['10-9-287']
and i wanna make sure you know i really do like you.:::['10-9-288']
sure, just not as much as clams.:::['10-9-289']
well, stuffed clams, ha, ha...:::['10-9-290']
chocolate torte for the lady. mm.:::['10-9-291']
cheesecake for the gentleman.:::['10-9-292']
uh, excuse me, sir. there seems to be some sort of red crap on my cheesecake.:::['10-9-293']
oh. yes, that's a raspberry coulis.:::['10-9-294']
i'm so stupid ordering cheesecake, trying to be healthy.:::['10-9-295']
oh, my god. mm.:::['10-9-296']
i'll just have what she's having. i'm sorry, sir.:::['10-9-297']
that was our last piece. mm.:::['10-9-298']
this is work. i should call in. can you excuse me?:::['10-9-301']
oh, yeah, sure. no problem.:::['10-9-302']
what are you doing? i thought you don't share food?:::['10-9-303']
sure i do.:::['10-9-304']
coulis? ha, ha.:::['10-9-305']
no. if i can't have your clams, you can't have my dessert.:::['10-9-306']
this is a two-way street.:::['10-9-307']
really.:::['10-9-309', '2-8-196', '5-24-77', '3-19-220']
now this all better be here when i come back.:::['10-9-310']
yeah, of course. i can control myself. ha-ha-ha. yeah.:::['10-9-311']
stop staring at me!:::['10-9-312']
just a tiny little... ha, ha.:::['10-9-313']
i'm not even sorry.:::['10-9-315']
erica: hi. man: hey.:::['10-9-316']
so these are the preliminary forms for an open adoption. uh...:::['10-9-317']
there's a lot to go over, but i'll explain as we go through.:::['10-9-318']
is that a picture? erica: yeah.:::['10-9-319']
it's a sonogram they took of the baby last week.:::['10-9-320']
i thought you might wanna see it.:::['10-9-321']
look, doctor.:::['10-9-322']
look, before we sign anything, we really have to talk.:::['10-9-323']
we're not who you think we are.:::['10-9-324']
i don't understand. the agency must have made a mistake.:::['10-9-325']
my wife is not a reverend, and i'm not a doctor.:::['10-9-326']
what? that's impossible.:::['10-9-327']
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.:::['10-9-328']
um, i have to check your file. excuse me.:::['10-9-329']
so who are you?:::['10-9-330']
our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york.:::['10-9-331']
yeah, but the important thing to know about us......is how much we would care:::['10-9-332']
for this little baby.:::['10-9-333']
so you lied to me before?:::['10-9-334']
well, we "bore false witness.":::['10-9-335']
see? i could be a reverend.:::['10-9-336']
but we were hoping that since we told you the truth......that you still might consider...:::['10-9-338']
giving you my baby?:::['10-9-339']
you think i'd give you my child after this?:::['10-9-340']
you don't have to decide now. if you look at our file...:::['10-9-341']
i don't wanna look at your file. this is over.:::['10-9-342']
erica, wait.:::['10-9-343']
i have nothing to say to you.:::['10-9-344']
look, you have every reason to be upset. we did lie.:::['10-9-345']
but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long.:::['10-9-346']
and we don't know how long it's gonna be before we get another chance.:::['10-9-347']
why don't you ask the reverend to pray on it?:::['10-9-348']
erica, please.:::['10-9-349']
just consider us. ask them to see our file.:::['10-9-350']
our last name's bing.:::['10-9-351']
my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising.:::['10-9-352']
i actually liked you guys.:::['10-9-354']
but it doesn't matter. what you did was wrong.:::['10-9-355']
but you did like us.:::['10-9-356']
and you should.:::['10-9-357']
my wife's an incredible woman.:::['10-9-358']
she is loving, and devoted and caring.:::['10-9-359']
and don't tell her i said this, but the woman's always right.:::['10-9-360']
i love my wife more than anything in this world.:::['10-9-361']
and it...:::['10-9-362']
it kills me that i can't give her a baby.:::['10-9-363']
i really want a kid.:::['10-9-364']
and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad.:::['10-9-365']
but my wife......she's already there.:::['10-9-366']
she's a mother......without a baby.:::['10-9-367']
you still want that baby?:::['10-9-369']
god bless you, chandler bing!:::['10-9-370']
turns out this sweater is made for a woman.:::['10-9-371']
so why are you still wearing it?:::['10-9-372']
because it's soft.:::['10-9-373']
hey, so how was your date? ugh.:::['10-9-374']
not so good.:::['10-9-375']
well, looks like it's just the two of us tonight, huh, buddy?:::['10-9-376']
yeah. and you know what? we could do a lot worse.:::['10-9-377']
yeah. yeah. ha-ha-ha.:::['10-9-378']
erica, are you okay? yeah, you know, maybe i ate too much.:::['10-17-1', '10-16-286']
i keep getting these stomachaches. they come and go, like, every few minutes.:::['10-17-2']
oh, my god. relax, we'll just get her some antacids.:::['10-17-3', '10-16-288']
she doesn't have a stomachache! she's in labor!:::['10-17-4', '10-16-289']
rachel: if you think that i didn't say goodbye......because you don't mean as much:::['10-17-6']
to me as everybody else, you're wrong.:::['10-17-7', '10-16-312']
it's because you mean more to me.:::['10-17-8', '10-16-313']
rash! what?:::['10-17-9', '10-16-315']
hey. ha, ha.:::['10-17-10']
shh. go back to sleep. i have to go home.:::['10-17-11']
oh, god. this was amazing.:::['10-17-12']
you've learned some new moves.:::['10-17-14']
yeah, well, uh, this guy at work gave me sex for dummies as a joke.:::['10-17-15']
ah. who's laughing now? i am.:::['10-17-16']
next time, can i say "breathe"?:::['10-17-19']
no. last time, you said it like dracula, and it scared her.:::['10-17-20']
can i get you anything? want more ice chips?:::['10-17-21']
no, i'm okay. monica: all right. i'll be right back.:::['10-17-22']
where you going? to use the bathroom.:::['10-17-23']
you can't leave me alone with her. what?:::['10-17-24']
this is exactly the kind of social situation......that i am not comfortable with.:::['10-17-25']
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with?:::['10-17-26']
it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone together.:::['10-17-27']
you'll be fine. you won't, but i'll be back in two minutes.:::['10-17-28']
so, uh, any plans for the summer?:::['10-17-30']
i don't know. maybe church camp.:::['10-17-31']
ha...:::['10-17-32']
may not want to mention this.:::['10-17-33']
so you ever wonder which is worse?:::['10-17-34']
you know, going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?:::['10-17-35']
what? oh, it's just interesting.:::['10-17-36']
you know, because no one will ever know because no one can experience both.:::['10-17-37']
one of life's great unanswerable questions.:::['10-17-38']
i mean, who knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things.:::['10-17-39']
like this.:::['10-17-40', '5-8-286']
come in. morning.:::['10-17-41']
hey. what's that?:::['10-17-42']
oh, it's my housewarming present for monica and chandler.:::['10-17-43']
that's a baby chick and duck. uh-huh.:::['10-17-44']
and i named them chick jr. and duck jr.:::['10-17-45']
i did not see that coming. uh-huh. yeah.:::['10-17-46']
they'll love it at that new house. it has that big backyard.:::['10-17-47']
and when they're old, they can go to that farm......that chandler took:::['10-17-48']
the other chick and duck to.:::['10-17-49']
yes. yeah.:::['10-17-50', '3-19-102']
it's a shame people can't visit there. that is the rule though.:::['10-17-51']
guess what. you're almost an uncle. what?:::['10-17-52']
erica went into labor. monica and chandler are at the hospital right now.:::['10-17-53']
oh, my god! i have a feeling it's gonna be a girl.:::['10-17-54']
phoebe, you were sure ben was gonna be a girl.:::['10-17-55']
have you seen him throw a ball'?:::['10-17-56']
is rachel here? uh, i think she's still asleep.:::['10-17-57']
hey, hey, hey. how did it go with you guys last night? she seemed pretty pissed at you.:::['10-17-58']
we, uh-- you know, we worked things out.:::['10-17-59']
what's that smile? did something happen with you two?:::['10-17-60']
hey, i'm not one to kiss and tell.:::['10-17-61']
uh, but i'm also not one to have sex and shut up. we totally did it.:::['10-17-62']
oh, my god. you and rachel?:::['10-17-63']
i know, it's pretty great. so, what does that mean? are you guys getting back together? oh, i don't know.:::['10-17-64']
we didn't really get to talk. but do you want to get back together?:::['10-17-65']
it was incredible. i mean, it just felt so right.:::['10-17-67']
when i was holding her, i mean, i never wanted to let her go.:::['10-17-68']
know what? yeah, i do. i want to be together.:::['10-17-69']
_yay! shh!:::['10-17-70']
so is she still going to paris?:::['10-17-72']
wow, i hadn't thought of that. i hope not.:::['10-17-73']
this is, like, the best day ever. ever. you guys might get back together.:::['10-17-74']
monica and chandler get their baby. there are chicks and ducks......in the world again.:::['10-17-75']
oh. i feel like i'm in a musical.:::['10-17-76']
when the sun comes up bright and beamin':::['10-17-77']
and the moon comes morning. guess you'll never know how it ends.:::['10-17-78']
hi. how'd you sleep? good. you?:::['10-17-80']
good. i'll bet you did.:::['10-17-81']
uh, would you guys mind giving us a minute?:::['10-17-82']
sure. yeah. just keep an eye on the chick and duck.:::['10-17-83']
chick and the duck'? didn't they die--?:::['10-17-84']
dive. yeah, they dove. headfirst into fun on the farm.:::['10-17-85']
morning. you too.:::['10-17-87']
last night was just wonderful. oh, it really was.:::['10-17-88']
i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.:::['10-17-89']
i know, me too. it was...:::['10-17-90']
you know, it was like one of those things you think is never gonna happen.:::['10-17-91']
and then it does, and it's everything you want it to be.:::['10-17-92']
i know. it was just...:::['10-17-93']
it's just the perfect way to say goodbye.:::['10-17-94']
monica: just a little bit more, honey. oh, man, this hurts!:::['10-17-95']
is it really that bad? uh-huh.:::['10-17-96']
i think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse.:::['10-17-97']
the baby's head is crowning.:::['10-17-98']
oh, my god! that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen.:::['10-17-99']
chandler, you have to see this. i'm okay.:::['10-17-100']
you don't want to miss this. this is the birth of your child.:::['10-17-101']
it's the miracle of life. all right.:::['10-17-102']
wow, that is one disgusting miracle.:::['10-17-103']
start pushing. here we go.:::['10-17-104']
here come the shoulders.:::['10-17-105']
it's a boy.:::['10-17-106']
is he okay? doctor: he's just fine.:::['10-17-107']
you did it.:::['10-17-108']
it's a baby.:::['10-17-109']
a beautiful little baby. and some other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.:::['10-17-110']
would you like to cut the umbilical cord? monica: okay.:::['10-17-111']
well, that's spongy.:::['10-17-112']
hey, handsome.:::['10-17-114']
i'll love you so much that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you.:::['10-17-115']
we are so lucky. i know.:::['10-17-116']
he has your eyes.:::['10-17-117']
i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does.:::['10-17-118']
we'll just get him cleaned up a bit. okay.:::['10-17-119']
monica: oh, my god, he's beautiful.:::['10-17-120']
thank you so much. i'm really happy for you guys.:::['10-17-121']
how do you feel? i'm tired.:::['10-17-122']
you don't have that much time to relax. the other one will be along in a minute.:::['10-17-123']
i'm sorry, who should be along in a what, now?:::['10-17-124']
the next baby should be along in a minute.:::['10-17-125']
we only ordered one.:::['10-17-126']
you know it's twins, right? oh, yeah.:::['10-17-127']
these are the faces of two people in the know.:::['10-17-128']
i can't believe you didn't know its twins. this has never happened before.:::['10-17-129']
well, gosh. that makes me feel so special and good.:::['10-17-130']
did you know it was twins?:::['10-17-131']
yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic.:::['10-17-132']
did anybody tell you? i don't think so.:::['10-17-133']
although, they did mention something about two heartbeats... ...but i thought that was just mine and the baby's.:::['10-17-134']
they said, "both heartbeats are strong.":::['10-17-135']
and i thought, "well, that's good, because i'm having a baby.":::['10-17-136']
this is unbelievable. twins actually run in my family.:::['10-17-137']
can i see you for a second?:::['10-17-139', '3-9-50']
what do we do? what do you mean, "what do we do?":::['10-17-140']
twins!:::['10-17-141']
chandler, you're panicking. uh-huh! join me, won't you?:::['10-17-142']
what do you say we keep one and then just have an option on the other one?:::['10-17-143']
we can't split them up. why not?:::['10-17-144']
we could give each of them half a medallion.:::['10-17-145']
and then years later, they'll find each other......and be reunited. i mean,that's a great day for everybody.:::['10-17-146']
okay. what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?:::['10-17-147']
what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?:::['10-17-148']
yeah. because i hear the king is looking to adopt.:::['10-17-149']
monica, we are not ready to have two babies.:::['10-17-150']
that doesn't matter. we have waited so long for this.:::['10-17-151']
i don't care if it's two babies. i don't care if it's three babies.:::['10-17-152']
i don't care if the entire cast of eight is enough comes out of there.:::['10-17-153']
we are taking them home because they are our children.:::['10-17-154']
okay. shh.:::['10-17-155']
'qkay_ 'qkay!:::['10-17-156']
it looks like we're about ready over here. come on, erica.:::['10-17-158']
start pushing again now.:::['10-17-159']
here she comes. she? it's a girl?:::['10-17-160']
well, now we have one of each.:::['10-17-162']
and that's enough.:::['10-17-163']
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.:::['10-17-164']
oh, my god. what did you say?:::['10-17-165']
nothing. what do you say to that? ross, you've got to tell her how you feel.:::['10-17-166']
no way. well, you can't just give up.:::['10-17-167']
is that what a dinosaur would do?:::['10-17-168']
what? i'm just trying to speak your language.:::['10-17-169']
ross, rachel doesn't know that you even wanna get back together.:::['10-17-170']
if she did, she might feel differently. she might not even go.:::['10-17-171']
you really think so? phoebe: i'm telling you!:::['10-17-172']
oh, okay, this is the part of the musical where there'd be a good, convincing song.:::['10-17-173']
don't take no for an answer:::['10-17-174']
don't let love fly away:::['10-17-175']
hi. can't a girl finish a song around here?:::['10-17-176']
hey. hi. so i dropped emma off at my mom's.:::['10-17-177']
okay. you're not taking her tonight?:::['10-17-178']
no, we decided that i'd go ahead and set up first... ...then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday.:::['10-17-179']
wow. eight-hour flight with a baby. good luck, mom.:::['10-17-180']
are you kidding? eight hours with my mom talking about atkins. good luck, emma.:::['10-17-181']
all right. you know what? you're right. i should at least tell her how i feel.:::['10-17-182']
ross. wait, wait. what? what?:::['10-17-183']
could you get me a muffin?:::['10-17-184']
gunther: rachel? yeah?:::['10-17-185']
i know you're leaving tonight, but i just have to tell you.:::['10-17-186']
now, i don't know if that changes your plans at all.:::['10-17-188']
but i thought you should know.:::['10-17-189']
i love you too. probably not in the same way.:::['10-17-191']
but i do. and when i'm in a café having coffee......or i see a man with hair:::['10-17-192']
brighter than the sun......i'll think of you.:::['10-17-193']
bye, you guys. phoebe: bye.:::['10-17-194']
hey, you know what might help? i'm not getting you a muffin!:::['10-17-197']
do you think they recognize each other from in there?:::['10-17-198']
maybe. unless they're like people who've lived in apartments......next to each other for years, then one:::['10-17-199']
day they're pushed through a vagina......and they meet.:::['10-17-200']
nurse: we're going to take erica to recovery now.:::['10-17-201']
monica: there's something that we wanted to tell you.:::['10-17-202']
we decided to name the girl baby erica.:::['10-17-203']
oh, my god, that's just like my name!:::['10-17-204']
son of a gun, it is.:::['10-17-205']
anyway, i'm gonna go get some rest.:::['10-17-206']
i'm really glad i picked you guys. you're gonna make great parents.:::['10-17-207']
even chandler.:::['10-17-208']
okay, well, bye. bye.:::['10-17-209']
we'll call you. okay.:::['10-17-210']
have fun at church camp.:::['10-17-211']
look at these little bunnies. i know.:::['10-17-212']
you ready to trade?:::['10-17-213']
_qkay- _qkay-:::['10-17-214']
we could trade later. yeah, i'm good.:::['10-17-216']
phoebe: hey, what are you working on? a "welcome home" sign for the baby.:::['10-17-217']
how sweet! oh, is that the baby?:::['10-17-218']
no, i sat in the paint.:::['10-17-219']
joey: hey. so did you talk to rachel?:::['10-17-220']
no. and i'm not going to. what?:::['10-17-221']
why not? she's just gonna shoot me down.:::['10-17-222']
you saw what happened with gunther. that did not look like fun.:::['10-17-223']
how can you compare yourself to gunther?:::['10-17-224']
i mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way.:::['10-17-225']
you have a relationship with her. you slept together last night.:::['10-17-226']
yeah, and she still wants to go. it's pretty clear where she is.:::['10-17-227']
yeah, i know what you mean. i mean, sometimes--:::['10-17-228']
uh, joe. damn it!:::['10-17-229']
if i were gonna tell her, i don't have to do it now.:::['10-17-230']
okay? i'll be seeing her again. we've got time.:::['10-17-231']
no, you don't. she's going to paris! she is going to meet somebody.:::['10-17-232']
do you know how many hot guys there are in paris? it's a city of gunthers.:::['10-17-233']
what do you have there? oh, i made a little something.:::['10-17-235']
if i had more time to work on it, it'd be better, but...:::['10-17-236']
oh, my god, you did that yourself? honey, that's gorgeous.:::['10-17-237']
you know, the baby can't read, mike.:::['10-17-238']
hi. the car service just got here. i can't believe they're not home yet!:::['10-17-239']
i have to catch my stupid plane. i want to see the baby.:::['10-17-240']
monica just called from the cab. she said they should be here any minute.:::['10-17-241']
apparently, there's some big surprise. yeah, did she sound happy about it?:::['10-17-242']
because my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny-tiny beard.:::['10-17-243']
welcome home. ross: oh, my god.:::['10-17-244']
rachel: oh, my gosh. hey.:::['10-17-245']
ross & rachel: hey.:::['10-17-246']
hey, so, what is the big surprise?:::['10-17-247']
oh, my god! how did this--?:::['10-17-248']
okay, awkward question. the hospital knows you took two, right?:::['10-17-249']
yes. it's twins. oh, my-- they are so cute.:::['10-17-250']
now, what kinds are they? this is a boy. and that's a girl.:::['10-17-251']
her name is erica.:::['10-17-252']
hey, that pregnant girl's name was erica.:::['10-17-253']
yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time together.:::['10-17-254']
yeah, and we named the boy jack, after dad.:::['10-17-255']
he's gonna be so happy. jack bing. i love that.:::['10-17-256']
it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy. you know, "jack bing, morning gazette.:::['10-17-257']
i'm gonna blow this story wide open.":::['10-17-258']
oh, my gosh.:::['10-17-259', '5-1-344']
so beautiful. i want one.:::['10-17-260']
oh, yeah? well, tell me which one. i'll try to slip it in my coat.:::['10-17-261']
seriously. i mean, you want to make one of those?:::['10-17-262']
one? how about a whole bunch? really?:::['10-17-263']
yeah. we can teach them to sing, and we could be like the von trapp family.:::['10-17-264']
only without the nazis. although that sounds kind of dull.:::['10-17-265']
i can't believe this. if i don't leave now, i'm gonna miss my plane.:::['10-17-266']
i'm so glad you got to see the babies. rachel: me too.:::['10-17-267']
i'm just sorry i'm not gonna be around to watch you two attempt to handle this.:::['10-17-268']
all right. oh, i can't say goodbye to you guys again.:::['10-17-269']
i love you all so much. love you.:::['10-17-270']
we love you. call us when you get there.:::['10-17-271']
i will. ross, come here.:::['10-17-272']
i just want you to know......last night......i'll never forget it.:::['10-17-273']
neither will i.:::['10-17-274']
all right. now i really have to go.:::['10-17-275']
okay, au revoir.:::['10-17-276']
they're gonna really hate me over there.:::['10-17-278']
so you just let her go?:::['10-17-279']
hey, maybe that's for the best. yeah?:::['10-17-281']
yeah. you know, you just-- look, you gotta--:::['10-17-282']
you gotta think about last night the way she does.:::['10-17-283']
okay? you know, maybe...:::['10-17-284']
maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye.:::['10-17-285']
but now she'll never know how he feels. maybe that's okay, you know?:::['10-17-286']
maybe it is better this way.:::['10-17-287']
i mean, now... now you can move on.:::['10-17-288']
i mean, you've been trying to for so long.:::['10-17-289']
maybe now that you're on different continents...:::['10-17-290']
right? yeah.:::['10-17-291']
maybe now you can actually do it, you know.:::['10-17-292']
you can finally get over her.:::['10-17-293']
except.:::['10-17-295']
i don't want to get over her. what?:::['10-17-296']
i don't. i want to be with her. really?:::['10-17-297']
yeah. i'm going to go after her. yeah, you are!:::['10-17-298']
wait! wait! get your coat! get your coat!:::['10-17-299']
my coat. this is so cool!:::['10-17-300']
i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!:::['10-17-301']
what do you think she's gonna say? i don't know.:::['10-17-302']
but even if she shoots me down, at least i won't spend my life wondering......what would have happened.:::['10-17-303']
where is my coat?:::['10-17-304']
you didn't bring one! my cab's downstairs. i'll drive you to the airport.:::['10-17-305']
wish me luck. hurry!:::['10-17-306']
joey: good luck!:::['10-17-307']
there's no seat belts! that's okay. if we hit anything......the engine will explode,so it's better if you're thrown from the car.:::['10-17-308']
all right, all right. let's do this. okay!:::['10-17-309']
hey! 80th and east end.:::['10-17-310']
no. i don't take passengers. the law makes you accept any fare.:::['10-17-311']
you don't understand. this cab isn't real.:::['10-17-312']
what's your medallion number?:::['10-17-313']
my medallion number is, get out of the cab!:::['10-17-314']
what? get out of the cab!:::['10-17-315']
oh, hey, can i give you guys your housewarming gift now?:::['10-17-316']

chick jr.? duck jr.?:::['10-17-318']
don't hide from mama!:::['10-17-319']
you can open your eyes now.:::['10-17-320']
are we off the bridge? yes!:::['10-17-321']
is the old woman on the bicycle still alive? yeah, she jumped right back up.:::['10-17-322']
oh, my god. phoebe, slow down! do you want to get to rachel in time?:::['10-17-323']
yes, but i don't want to die in your cab.:::['10-17-324']

oh, great. just what you want for a new house with infants. bird feces!:::['10-17-340']

don't worry, we'll find them.:::['10-17-342']
i'm gonna go check on the twins. all right.:::['10-17-343']

it's okay. it's just an egg roll. oh.:::['10-17-345']
you stepped on my egg roll?:::['10-17-346']
i'm sorry. i didn't know to look for chinese food on the floor.:::['10-17-347']
just put it on a plate and leave.:::['10-17-348']
okay. let's find these birds. all right.:::['10-17-349']
wait, wait. you hear that?:::['10-17-350']
they're in the table! well, that can't be good.:::['10-17-351']

maybe we can lure them out. you know any birdcalls?:::['10-17-353']
oh, tons. i'm quite the woodsman.:::['10-17-354']
well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.:::['10-17-355']
joey, wait! the ball!:::['10-17-356']
so, what do we do?:::['10-17-357']
maybe we can open this up somehow.:::['10-17-358']
no. it's all glued together.:::['10-17-360']
does that mean we have to bust it open?:::['10-17-361']
i don't know. maybe. oh, my god.:::['10-17-362']
i know. it's-- it's the foosball table.:::['10-17-363']
all right, you know what? we don't have a choice.:::['10-17-364']
it's like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd have gotten the part.:::['10-17-365']
those are our men in there, and we have to get them out......even if i have to sacrifice:::['10-17-366']
the most important thing in my life......my time machine.:::['10-17-367']
did that movie ever get made? it did not.:::['10-17-368']
white courtesy phone. jack weinberg.:::['10-17-369']
ross, where are you going? uh, to talk to rachel.:::['10-17-370']
isn't that why we took a ride in the death cab?:::['10-17-371']
you're walking up to her at the gate?:::['10-17-372']
have you never chased anyone through the airport before?:::['10-17-373']
not since my cop show got canceled.:::['10-17-374']
you have to get a ticket to get past security.:::['10-17-375']
what? we're never gonna make it. not with that attitude. now, haul ass!:::['10-17-376']
okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great.:::['10-17-377']
madame, your passport, please. oh, my god.:::['10-17-378']

and we're also gonna buy you tiny bird hearing aids.:::['10-17-420']
okay. here goes.:::['10-17-421']
i need to say goodbye to the table first.:::['10-17-423']
table......you have given us:::['10-17-426']
so many great times.:::['10-17-427']
and you guys, jordan, victor, joel...:::['10-17-428']
all of you guys. what can i say?:::['10-17-429']
you guys make us look good.:::['10-17-430']
you want to say anything? i don't know.:::['10-17-431']
except that, for one last time...:::['10-17-432']
good game. good game. good game.:::['10-17-433']
good game. yeah.:::['10-17-434']
well, i can't do it either.:::['10-17-437']
hey. did you find them? yeah. they're stuck inside the table.:::['10-17-438']
and we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it.:::['10-17-439']
oh, well, sure. it's got to be so hard.:::['10-17-440']
i'll do it. give me.:::['10-17-441']
ross: phoebe! no, no, no!:::['10-17-442']
wow, i've never gone this fast before.:::['10-17-443']
phoebe, forget it, okay? newark is, like, an hour away.:::['10-17-444']
there's no way we'll make it in time.:::['10-17-445']
she's got her cell. you could call her. i am not doing this over the phone.:::['10-17-446']
you don't have any other choice.:::['10-17-447']
hello? rachel. oh, good.:::['10-17-448']
by the way, did you just get on the plane?:::['10-17-449']
yeah. we would have caught her...:::['10-17-450']
...if we were at the right airport. yay.:::['10-17-451']
um, rachel, hang on. no. no. no.:::['10-17-452']
phoebe, is everything okay?:::['10-17-453']
actually, no. no. you have to get off the plane.:::['10-17-455']
what? why? i have this feeling that......something's wrong with it.:::['10-17-456']
something is wrong with the left phalange.:::['10-17-457']
oh, honey, i'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.:::['10-17-458']
look, i have to go. i love you, and i will call you the minute i get to paris.:::['10-17-459']
um, ahem...:::['10-17-460', '4-6-114']
what was that? oh, that was just my crazy friend.:::['10-17-461']
she told me to get off the plane because she had a "feeling" that there......was something wrong:::['10-17-462']
with the left phalange.:::['10-17-463']
okay. uh, that doesn't sound good. oh, i wouldn't worry about it.:::['10-17-464']
she comes up with this stuff, and she's almost never right.:::['10-17-465']
but she is sometimes. well...:::['10-17-466']
what are you doing? i can't take this plane now.:::['10-17-467']
excuse me, sir. where are you going? i have to get off this plane.:::['10-17-468']
her friend has a feeling something's wrong with the left phalange.:::['10-17-469']
could i get some peanuts?:::['10-17-470']
what's wrong with the plane? there's nothing wrong.:::['10-17-471']
the left phalange. there's no "phalange.":::['10-17-472']
oh, my god. this plane doesn't even have a phalange.:::['10-17-473']
i'm not flying on it. please sit down.:::['10-17-474']
what's going on'? we're getting off. there is no phalange!:::['10-17-475']
this is ridiculous. i--:::['10-17-476']
all right. my job here is done.:::['10-17-478']
that was impressive.:::['10-17-479']
yeah. you didn't even use the tools for most of it.:::['10-17-480']
yeah, they were just slowing me down.:::['10-17-481']
all right. i gotta get back to the babies. see you girls later.:::['10-17-482']
sorry about the table, man. yeah.:::['10-17-483']
you gonna buy a new one?:::['10-17-484']
probably not. no.:::['10-17-485']
i don't know how much i'm gonna want to play after you go.:::['10-17-486']
well, at least we got these little guys out. yeah.:::['10-17-487']
aw, we were worried about you.:::['10-17-488']
i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?:::['10-17-490']
i'm gonna miss these little guys.:::['10-17-491']
it was nice having birds around again.:::['10-17-492']
hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.:::['10-17-493']
what? yeah. we got a lot going on right now.:::['10-17-494']
and plus, here, they'd have their own room.:::['10-17-495']
i could get a goose!:::['10-17-496']
you know, i think you're set with the poultry.:::['10-17-497']
thanks, man. you hear that, you guys?:::['10-17-498']
you're gonna get to stay here. and it's good......you know, because, uh...:::['10-17-499']
because now you have a reason to come visit.:::['10-17-500']
i think there may be another reason.:::['10-17-501']
awkward hug or lame cool-guy handshake?:::['10-17-503']
yeah, well, you know, lame cool-guy handshake.:::['10-17-504']
ma'am, i assure you, the plane is fine. and you fixed the phalange?:::['10-17-505']
yes. the phalange's fixed.:::['10-17-506']
in fact, we've put a whole lot of extra phalanges on board, just in case.:::['10-17-507']
mr. josh anderson.:::['10-17-508']
ross: where is she? phoebe: i don't see her.:::['10-17-509']
rachel! rachel green! there she is!:::['10-17-510']

please, please stay with me. i am so in love with you. please don't go.:::['10-17-520']
oh, my god. i know. i know.:::['10-17-521']
i shouldn't have waited till now to say it, but, um-- that was stupid, okay? i'm sorry.:::['10-17-522']
but i'm telling you now. i love you.:::['10-17-523']
do not get on this plane. miss, are you boarding the plane?:::['10-17-524']
hey, he)'-:::['10-17-525']
i know you love me. i know you do.:::['10-17-526']

i can't do this right now, i'm sorry. i'm sorry.:::['10-17-531']
i really thought she'd stay.:::['10-17-534']
well, that's it.:::['10-17-537', '4-4-163']
everything's packed.:::['10-17-538']
this is weird. monica: i know.:::['10-17-540']
uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?:::['10-17-542']
i put three lasagnas in your freezer.:::['10-17-543']
hey. hey. did you guys make it in time?:::['10-17-545']
yeah, yeah. he talked to her, but, um, she got on the plane anyway.:::['10-17-546']
where's ross?:::['10-17-547']
he went home. he didn't want to see anybody.:::['10-17-548']
ross. hi, it's me.:::['10-17-549']
i just got back on the plane, and i just feel awful.:::['10-17-550']
that is so not how i wanted things to end with us.:::['10-17-551']
it's just that i wasn't expecting to see you.:::['10-17-552']
and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things.:::['10-17-553']
now i'm just sitting here and thinking......of all the stuff i should have said:::['10-17-554']
and i didn't.:::['10-17-555']
i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love you too.:::['10-17-556']
because of course i do. i love you.:::['10-17-557']
what am i doing? i love you.:::['10-17-560']
i've got to see you. i've got to get off this plane.:::['10-17-561']
okay, excuse me. woman: miss, please sit down.:::['10-17-563']
rachel: no, i'm sorry. i'm really sorry, but i need to get off the plane.:::['10-17-564']
i need to tell someone that i love them. woman: i can't let you off.:::['10-17-565']
let her off the plane!:::['10-17-566']
woman: you have to take your seat.:::['10-17-567']
rachel: oh, please, miss. you don't understand.:::['10-17-568']
try to understand!:::['10-17-569']
come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off the--?:::['10-17-570']
oh, my god. did she get off the plane? did she get off the plane?:::['10-17-572']
rachel: i got off the plane.:::['10-17-573']
you got off the plane.:::['10-17-574']
i do love you.:::['10-17-575']
i love you too, and i am never letting you go again.:::['10-17-576']
okay. because this is where i want to be. okay? no more messing around.:::['10-17-577']
i don't want to mess this up again. me neither. we're done being stupid.:::['10-17-578']
okay. it's you and me, all right? this is it.:::['10-17-579']
this is it. unless we're on a break.:::['10-17-580']
don't make jokes now.:::['10-17-581']
okay, please be careful with that. it was my grandmother's. be careful.:::['10-17-582']
if that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.:::['10-17-584']
seems smaller somehow.:::['10-17-587']
has it always been purple?:::['10-17-588']
look around, you guys. this was your first home.:::['10-17-589']
and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter.:::['10-17-590']
but more important, because of rent control, it was a frigging steal.:::['10-17-591']
hey, do you realize that, at one time or another, we all lived in this apartment?:::['10-17-592']
rachel: oh, yeah. that's true.:::['10-17-593']
uh, i haven't.:::['10-17-594']
what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma......and you tried to make it as a dancer?:::['10-17-595']
do you realize we almost made it 10 years without that coming up?:::['10-17-596']
oh, honey, i forgot. i promised treeger that we'd leave our keys.:::['10-17-597']
so i guess this is it. yeah.:::['10-17-599']
this is harder than i thought it would be.:::['10-17-601']
oh, it's gonna be okay.:::['10-17-602']
do you guys have to go to the new house now, or do you have some time?:::['10-17-604']
we got some time.:::['10-17-605']
okay. should we get some coffee? sure.:::['10-17-606']
all right, let's play one more time, okay?:::['10-16-0']
and remember, if i win, you do not move to paris.:::['10-16-1']
okay. i can't believe i'm risking this again, but you're on.:::['10-16-2']
all right, joe, you remember the rules. heads, i win. tails, you lose.:::['10-16-3']
just flip.:::['10-16-4']
tails! damn it!:::['10-16-5']
so we thought we'd throw you a little going-away party around 7.:::['10-16-6']
oh, that sounds good.:::['10-16-7']
hey, rach, you're leaving tomorrow. shouldn't you be packing?:::['10-16-8']
it's all done. oh, yeah, right.:::['10-16-9']
and after i took a shower this morning, i just threw my towel on the floor.:::['10-16-10']
oh, god, it hurts to even joke about it. rachel: i know.:::['10-16-11']
honey, seriously, i did it all. the luggage that i'm taking is in the bedroom.:::['10-16-12']
this is emma's paris stuff. these are the boxes that i'm having shipped......and that's the sandwich:::['10-16-13']
i made for the plane.:::['10-16-14']
okay, you've done some good work. rachel: yeah.:::['10-16-15']
what about your carry-ons?:::['10-16-16']
oh, well, everything that i need is in here......and my travel documents:::['10-16-17']
are on the counter......organized in the order:::['10-16-18']
that i will be needing them.:::['10-16-19']
oh, my god. i have nothing left to teach you.:::['10-16-20']
where's your passport? it should be next to my plane ticket.:::['10-16-21']
well, it's not. rachel: what? maybe i put it in here?:::['10-16-22']
oh! oh, it's not in there!:::['10-16-23']
oh, no, i must have packed it in one of these boxes!:::['10-16-24']
here, let me help you. shoot.:::['10-16-25']
i can't believe i did this.:::['10-16-26']
at what point did it stop being funny that i took her passport?:::['10-16-27']
oh, wow, can you believe you're only three weeks away?:::['10-16-28']
you don't mind me touching your belly? i don't mind you touching my belly......but your hand's kind of blocking the:::['10-16-30']
part where the baby's gonna come out.:::['10-16-31']
hey! erica: hey.:::['10-16-32']
hi, erica. welcome back to town. wow, look how big you've gotten.:::['10-16-33']
that's because i'm pregnant.:::['10-16-34']
right. no, i understand. oh, okay.:::['10-16-35']
i'm just always afraid that people think i'm just fat with big breasts.:::['10-16-36']
no, no, i knew.:::['10-16-37']
okay, well, stop staring at them. she brought them up.:::['10-16-38']
i didn't realize you were coming back so soon.:::['10-16-39']
in a couple weeks i won't be able to travel.:::['10-16-40']
i wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel.:::['10-16-41']
why isn't she staying with you guys? because we're moving in a couple days.:::['10-16-42']
plus, hotels are fun! my room has this little fridge full of free snacks.:::['10-16-43']
erica, those things aren't free.:::['10-16-44']
in fact, they have one of the highest markups of any consumer product--:::['10-16-45']
ross, she's giving us her baby. she can eat you if she wants.:::['10-16-46']
erica: i'll be right back.:::['10-16-47']
oh, man, i can't believe you guys are leaving this place.:::['10-16-48']
you know, you could take it if you want. the lease is still in nana's name.:::['10-16-50']
no, no. this will always be your place. it would be too sad.:::['10-16-51']
plus, how much a month does it cost to feed joey?:::['10-16-52']
yeah, it takes two incomes.:::['10-16-53']
hey, is chandler here? we talked about catching a movie.:::['10-16-54']
oh, no, he doesn't have time for that.:::['10-16-55']
you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room.:::['10-16-56']
hmm. packing. sexy cheerleader comedy.:::['10-16-57']
hmm. helpful brother. creepy loner at teen movie.:::['10-16-58']
creep)':::['10-16-59']

what the hell is this? hey, handcuffs. and fur-lined. nice.:::['10-16-73']
i didn't know you guys had it in you.:::['10-16-74']
chandler, you don't have a sister, so you can't understand......how much this bums me out.:::['10-16-75']
i didn't know monica had these.:::['10-16-76']
maybe she used them with another boyfriend. maybe richard.:::['10-16-77']
why would she use them with richard and not me? i can be kinky.:::['10-16-78']
i once did a naked dance for her with scarves.:::['10-16-79']
bumming hard, guys. bumming hard.:::['10-16-80']
hey. hey. where's mike?:::['10-16-81']
phoebe: oh, he has a gig.:::['10-16-82']
it's kind of like being married to a rock star, you know?:::['10-16-83']
my husband has a gig.:::['10-16-84']
yeah? where is it?:::['10-16-85']
oh, he's playing organ for a children's roller-skating party.:::['10-16-86']
rock on!:::['10-16-87']
wow, this is quite a spread. what is all this stuff?:::['10-16-88']
well, i thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food......that i don't want to move:::['10-16-89']
to the new house with me.:::['10-16-90']
so enjoy. smoked oyster casserole with a breakfast-cereal crust.:::['10-16-91']
kidney beans in their own juices, and for dessert, a questionable orange.:::['10-16-92']
ross: where's rach? she's putting emma down.:::['10-16-94']
she'll be over in a second. it just hit her that she's leaving.:::['10-16-95']
she's kind of emotional, no one say anything to set her off, okay?:::['10-16-96']
all: hey, rach. hey.:::['10-16-98']
there she is.:::['10-16-99', '4-21-256']
hi, you guys.:::['10-16-100']
oh, no, no, no, it's okay. it's okay. i'm gonna be fine.:::['10-16-102']
monica: come, i'll make you a drink. okay.:::['10-16-103']
oh, man, i can't believe she's actually leaving.:::['10-16-104']
how am i gonna say goodbye to rachel?:::['10-16-105']
i know, she's been such a big part of my life.:::['10-16-106']
it feels like when melrose place got canceled.:::['10-16-107']
ah, forget it, i miss melrose place.:::['10-16-109']
i had a chance to stop her too. yeah?:::['10-16-110']
who loses 57 coin tosses in a row? you know?:::['10-16-111']
heads, she wins. tails, i lose.:::['10-16-112']
yes, joe? i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning.:::['10-16-114']
so you doing okay?:::['10-16-115']
well, i've been better. you guys are gonna come visit, right?:::['10-16-116']
yes. you know, in six months, the statute of limitations runs out......and i can travel internationally again.:::['10-16-117']
i'm gonna miss you so much. i know.:::['10-16-118']
you know what? um, i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say......to each of you. and i was gonna save it:::['10-16-119']
till the end of the night, but come here.:::['10-16-120']
hey, what do you think they're doing in there?:::['10-16-121']
if i had to guess, i'd say......rachel's putting on the bubble wrap,and phoebe's doing the punching.:::['10-16-122']
pheebs, i don't even know where to start.:::['10-16-123']
okay, well, before you do... uh-huh.:::['10-16-124']
i know we weren't supposed to get you presents...:::['10-16-125']
...but i do have something for you. oh! oh!:::['10-16-126']
what is it? well, it's a cotton swab......with a bit of my saliva on it......so that if they perfect the cloning:::['10-16-128']
process while you're over there......you can use the dna:::['10-16-129']
to create your own pheebs.:::['10-16-130']
i'm gonna throw this away......but thank you so much:::['10-16-131']
for the gesture.:::['10-16-132']
um, i was just in our bedroom, and i found these on my pillow.:::['10-16-134']
oh, yes, i decided to leave those out for you in case richard stops by......and you want to engage in a little:::['10-16-135']
light bondage and mustache play.:::['10-16-136']
what are you talking about? these aren't mine.:::['10-16-137']
oh, yeah, right!:::['10-16-138']
good luck getting another scarf dance from me.:::['10-16-139']
that would be a terrible punishment.:::['10-16-140']
but i'm serious, i've never seen these before.:::['10-16-141']
really? then what are they doing in our guest room?:::['10-16-142']
rachel used to live in that room.:::['10-16-143']
rachel. with handcuffs.:::['10-16-144']
joey's bare ass.:::['10-16-146']
well played.:::['10-16-147']
i love you, phoebe. phoebe: i love you too.:::['10-16-148']
please...:::['10-16-149']
please don't--:::['10-16-150']
don't turn into, you know, a french bitch.:::['10-16-151']
all right. well, if i'm gonna do this, i better keep going.:::['10-16-153']
monica? yeah?:::['10-16-155']
rachel: will you come with me? sure.:::['10-16-156']
are you wearing waterproof mascara? no.:::['10-16-157']
oh, you're so screwed.:::['10-16-158']
she's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.:::['10-16-161']
are you kidding? oh, my god.:::['10-16-162']
yeah, i know. it's gonna be even worse for you. god.:::['10-16-163']
well, just get ready to do some serious crying.:::['10-16-164']
man, i'm not gonna be able to handle this.:::['10-16-165']
now i know how my students feel at the end of each year.:::['10-16-166']
and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.:::['10-16-167']
mon. okay.:::['10-16-168']
i better just say what it is i'm gonna say.:::['10-16-169']
none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last 10 years......would have happened:::['10-16-170']
if it wasn't for you.:::['10-16-171']
no one has been more like a sister to me.:::['10-16-172']
i know what you mean.:::['10-16-173']
you're like a sister to me too.:::['10-16-174']
rachel: i don't know what i'm going to do without you.:::['10-16-175']
you're the greatest friend i ever had.:::['10-16-176']
seeing you every day.:::['10-16-177']
see you every day!:::['10-16-179']
that is so sweet!:::['10-16-180']
oh, no, she took down monica.:::['10-16-181']
and i'm the crier in the family.:::['10-16-182']
oh, god, i could be next.:::['10-16-183']
maybe she won't talk to me if it looks like we're in conversation.:::['10-16-184']
joey: okay. that thing you said about the thing......it really made me think:::['10-16-185']
about that other thing.:::['10-16-186']
rash? oh, it's okay, chandler's talking to her.:::['10-16-187']
i really made you think about that thing, huh?:::['10-16-188']
uh, rach, i think i have something that belongs to you.:::['10-16-189']
oh, i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get.:::['10-16-190']
no, no, they're really yours. we found them in your old room.:::['10-16-191']
well, these aren't mine. maybe monica used to use them with--:::['10-16-192']
don't say richard.:::['10-16-193']
well, if they're not monica's and they're not yours, then whose are they?:::['10-16-194']
i think you're forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room.:::['10-16-195']
pheebs! yeah!:::['10-16-196']
i think these are yours.:::['10-16-197']
these are not mine. look how flimsy they are. come on.:::['10-16-198']
my god, you try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these......they'll snap like a piece of licorice.:::['10-16-199']
can i talk to you alone for a minute? sure.:::['10-16-200']
you don't really handcuff guys to water pipes do you?:::['10-16-201']
where do you think mike really is?:::['10-16-202']
let me just saying something because once we get into this......i'm gonna get all uncomfortable:::['10-16-204']
and probably make some stupid joke.:::['10-16-205']
i just want to say that i-- i love you.:::['10-16-206']
and i'm gonna miss you.:::['10-16-207']
and i'm so sad that you're leaving.:::['10-16-208']
let's not say anything else.:::['10-16-210']
chandler: not so tight.:::['10-16-212']
i'm sorry, give me one more chance. okay.:::['10-16-213']
chandler: okay.:::['10-16-214']
oh! i'm sorry. just go. just go. i can't. i can't.:::['10-16-215']
so i guess you're next. you ready? i don't think so.:::['10-16-216']
oh, you're definitely not. i haven't cried like that in years.:::['10-16-217']
you cried yesterday at the 6:00 news.:::['10-16-218']
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.:::['10-16-219']
god, i can't believe she saved me for last.:::['10-16-220']
why are they taking so long?:::['10-16-221']
phoebe: i don't know. but, god, joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well.:::['10-16-222']
i think i'm gonna take off.:::['10-16-226']
oh, you guys, this was an amazing night. thank you so much.:::['10-16-228']
i don't get a goodbye?:::['10-16-232']
unbelievable. she says goodbye to everyone but me!:::['10-16-234']
well, maybe she thought that with all of your history, it could be...:::['10-16-235']
...you know, implicit. well, it needs to be "plicit.":::['10-16-236']
all right, let's think about this. i mean, there's gotta be an explanation.:::['10-16-237']
did you do anything to make her mad? no, i don't think so.:::['10-16-238']
you know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.:::['10-16-239']
it was pretty intense. yeah, mine too.:::['10-16-240']
mine was a humdinger. okay!:::['10-16-241']
i mean, don't i deserve anything? i mean, a few tears, a cursory hug?:::['10-16-242']
not from you!:::['10-16-243']
ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her.:::['10-16-244']
and say what? you owe me a goodbye?:::['10-16-245']
i mean, he's got more pride than that. the hell i do!:::['10-16-246']
i don't get a goodbye? what?:::['10-16-247']
everyone gets a goodbye but me? what do i gotta do to get a goodbye?:::['10-16-248']
huh? be best friends with you? go out with you?:::['10-16-249']
have a baby with you?:::['10-16-250']
oh, wait a minute. wait a minute! i did all those things!:::['10-16-251']
ross-- or maybe i'm just not giving you......enough credit. uh, i mean, it is difficult:::['10-16-252']
to say goodbye to five people.:::['10-16-253']
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, g--:::['10-16-254']
it's physically impossible!:::['10-16-255']
you know what? after all we've been through......i can't believe this is how:::['10-16-256']
you want to leave things between us.:::['10-16-257']
have a good time in paris.:::['10-16-258']
i hope ross isn't too upset. i'm sure he's not more bummed out...:::['10-16-259']
...than i am. tell me about it.:::['10-16-260']
well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party.:::['10-16-261']
i think i'm gonna head out.:::['10-16-262']
uh, where do you think you're going? i thought i was going home to bed......but i'm sensing there's something:::['10-16-263']
less fun for me to do here.:::['10-16-264']
we're moving in a couple days and we got a lot of packing to do.:::['10-16-265']
it'd be great if you guys could pitch in. joey and i can finish up the guest room.:::['10-16-266']
yeah, good idea.:::['10-16-267']
oh, no. you and phoebe are gonna help me in here.:::['10-16-268']
you couldn't be cool.:::['10-16-269']
monica: we're gonna start in the kitchen.:::['10-16-270']
plates get put into plate protectors and stacked 10 to a box.:::['10-16-271']
the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped. got it?:::['10-16-272']
yeah. good. i need you to be careful......and efficient. and remember,if i'm harsh with you......it is only because:::['10-16-273']
you're doing it wrong.:::['10-16-274']
hey, mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are.:::['10-16-275']
you did? how? well, i was cleaning out the closet......and i found some pictures of them...:::['10-16-276']
...being used. oh, my god, let me see.:::['10-16-277']
who's that dirty old lady?:::['10-16-278']
monica's grandmother.:::['10-16-279']
oh, my god. nana liked it rough!:::['10-16-280']
hi. hey. here, have a seat. yeah.:::['10-16-281']
how was your night? oh, it was okay.:::['10-16-282']
i went to a movie with my cousin then out for dinner.:::['10-16-283']
we went to this place that had--:::['10-16-284']
anyway, they had these really amazing cheeseburgers.:::['10-16-285']
i keep getting these stomachaches. they come and go every few minutes.:::['10-16-287']
oh, my god! yeah, you gotta get to the hospital!:::['10-16-290']
chandler, get the coats! erica, let's go! phoebe and joey, keep packing!:::['10-16-291']
oh, my god, we're gonna have a baby.:::['10-16-292']
we're gonna have a baby!:::['10-16-293']
oh, my god, we're gonna have a baby!:::['10-16-294']
oh, god, i've gotta sit down! i've gotta sit down!:::['10-16-295']
honey, it's gonna be okay. you can do this. just breathe.:::['10-16-296']
okay, i feel a little better.:::['10-16-298']
oh! are you sure?:::['10-16-299']
yes, i'm sure. oh, honey, let's go. okay.:::['10-16-300']
chandler: come, let's go. bye!:::['10-16-301']
we're having a baby! joey: good luck!:::['10-16-302']
chandler, wait, wait, wait! what?:::['10-16-303']
if you get a second, find out where she got that cheeseburger.:::['10-16-304']
you think i didn't say goodbye to you because i don't care?:::['10-16-305']
that's what it seemed like.:::['10-16-306']
i cannot believe that after 10 years you do not know one thing about me!:::['10-16-307']
then why didn't you say something? because it is too damn hard, ross!:::['10-16-308']
i can't even begin to explain to you how much i am gonna miss you.:::['10-16-309']
when i think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go.:::['10-16-310']
okay? so if you think that i didn't say goodbye to you......because you don't mean as much:::['10-16-311']
so there, all right? there's your goodbye!:::['10-16-314']
you keep-- you can't-- what?:::['10-16-316']
a little more. phoebe: okay.:::['10-16-317']
a little more. a little more. all right.:::['10-16-318']
little more.:::['10-16-319']
all right. all right, let's do this. all right, ready?:::['10-16-320']
yep. now give me your best shot.:::['10-16-321']
all right. here goes.:::['10-16-322']
doesn't work.:::['10-16-323']
rachel: hi. phoebe: hey.:::['10-8-1']
uh, we need to talk about something.:::['10-8-2']
yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.:::['10-8-3']
all: what? are you kidding?:::['10-8-4']
well, it's just with work and the stress of adoption......we don't feel like:::['10-8-5']
we have the energy.:::['10-8-6']
plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.:::['10-8-7']
that doesn't sound like you.:::['10-8-8']
that's monica talking.:::['10-8-9']
no, no. we made this decision together. she's putting words in your mouth.:::['10-8-10']
don't you put words in people's mouths. you put turkey in people's mouths.:::['10-8-11']
i can't believe this. this is emma's first thanksgiving.:::['10-8-12']
no, it's not. it's not? when was she born?:::['10-8-13']
well, personally, i think it's great you're giving yourself a break.:::['10-8-14']
thank you, pheebs. sure. it's just as well.:::['10-8-15']
i mean, last year wasn't very good. i think she's losing her touch.:::['10-8-16']
what? you are way off, lady. am i? really? am i?:::['10-8-17']
well, why don't you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong.:::['10-8-18']
well, think about it. you'd be trying to top what you did last year.:::['10-8-19']
you'd be in competition with yourself.:::['10-8-20']
that's my favorite kind.:::['10-8-21']
okay, we are doing this.:::['10-8-22']
don't let yourself get manipulated this way.:::['10-8-23']
stay out of this, chandler. this is between me and me.:::['10-8-24']
we are supposed to make these decisions together.:::['10-8-25']
did you not watch the dr. phil i taped for you?:::['10-8-26']
hey. hi. happy thanksgiving.:::['10-8-27']
oh, yeah. happy meatless turkey-murder day.:::['10-8-28']
you guys, i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleeker.:::['10-8-29']
could you pick them up for me? you're not making the pies?:::['10-8-30']
no, i don't make chocolate pies.:::['10-8-31']
when i was younger, i entered this pie-eating contest.:::['10-8-32']
i ate so many that the thought of them makes me sick.:::['10-8-33']
did you at least win the contest?:::['10-8-34']
two minutes, twelve pies and a part of one tin.:::['10-8-35']
okay, i'll see you guys at 4. rachel: can't wait.:::['10-8-36']
this dinner is gonna be so great. in your face, last-year me.:::['10-8-37']
hey, rach? yeah.:::['10-8-38']
um, what's emma doing today?:::['10-8-39']
well, let's see, uh, i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer......and then she has to make:::['10-8-40']
a very big poop.:::['10-8-41']
why? well, i want to enter her... ...in a baby beauty pageant.:::['10-8-42']
oh, my god. that's the creepiest thing i've ever heard.:::['10-8-43']
okay, but before you say no, my friend suzanne is entering her kid.:::['10-8-44']
and compared to emma, she's a real dog.:::['10-8-45']
agh. phoebe, all babies are beautiful. oh, okay.:::['10-8-46']
no. ugh, phoebe, just the idea of pitting one baby against another......i mean, you know, and judging:::['10-8-47']
who's cuter just for a trophy...:::['10-8-48']
and a thousand dollars. ...is something i'm very interested in.:::['10-8-49']
oh, please, do not tell ross.:::['10-8-50']
he still believes that what's on the inside is important.:::['10-8-51']
okay. oh, and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition.:::['10-8-52']
where am i gonna get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving?:::['10-8-53']
well, i was thinking... take the clothes......off joey's cabbage patch kid!:::['10-8-54']
festive music]:::['10-8-56']
did someone drop the baton again?:::['10-8-57']
why come all the way from kansas to do that?:::['10-8-58']
i don't get older, i just get better.:::['10-8-59']
you know what just occurred to me?:::['10-8-60']
this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us.:::['10-8-61']
i mean, we could be getting a baby soon.:::['10-8-62']
you don't know that. somebody's gonna pick us.:::['10-8-63']
but we haven't heard a thing from the adoption agency.:::['10-8-64']
i'm telling you, it's gonna happen.:::['10-8-65']
next year, it's gonna be you, me and little hemingway bing.:::['10-8-66']
what? he's my favorite author. name one of his books.:::['10-8-67']
the firm?:::['10-8-68']
okay, let's see. okay, the turkey's in the oven. the stuffing is ready.:::['10-8-69']
you know, you always cook this meal all by yourself. let me help this year.:::['10-8-70']
oh, chandler, that's sweet.:::['10-8-71']
but you don't have to do everything dr. phil tells you to do.:::['10-8-72']
i'm serious, let me do something. just not the turkey. nothing high-profile.:::['10-8-73']
okay, let's see. oh, the cranberry sauce.:::['10-8-74']
it's easy to make, and no one really cares about it.:::['10-8-75']
tell me more.:::['10-8-76']
i'm gonna go check on something across the hall. you start by washing these.:::['10-8-77']
not with soap!:::['10-8-78']
you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes.:::['10-8-79']
hi. hey, guess what joey has. three tickets to today's rangers game!:::['10-8-80']
dude, i wanted him to guess. oh.:::['10-8-81']
oh, my god. yeah, they're great seats too.:::['10-8-82']
guess where they are. center ice.:::['10-8-83']
did i do something to you?:::['10-8-84']
mm. the game's at 1. so?:::['10-8-85']
dinner's at 4. we'll never make it back. we leave before it's over. we'll be back.:::['10-8-86']
you say that, but it could take us a long time to get home.:::['10-8-87']
plus, joey could get lost and they could have to page us to go pick him up.:::['10-8-88']
dude, two times that happened!:::['10-8-89']
look, monica's been working hard all day.:::['10-8-90']
she didn't want to host in the first place. we shouldn't go.:::['10-8-91']
he's right, man.:::['10-8-92']
yeah, i guess. so we'll see you at 4. okay.:::['10-8-93']
and get ready to taste my very special cranberries.:::['10-8-94']
or should i say "chan-berries"?:::['10-8-95']
that's some gentle comedy, dude.:::['10-8-96']
we're still going to the game.:::['10-8-97']
woman: this is contestant number 16, rebecca hope from yonkers.:::['10-8-99']
hey. phoebe, listen, i think we gotta go.:::['10-8-100']
this place is freaking me out.:::['10-8-101']
i've been watching this guy over there. i don't think he came with a kid.:::['10-8-102']
but we can't leave now.:::['10-8-103']
there was this one baby, haley, who was favored to win......she got croup,so she had to stay home.:::['10-8-104']
this competition just blew wide-open, folks.:::['10-8-105']
phoebe, it's just too weird.:::['10-8-106']
i just saw a 1 -year-old run around with pantyhose on.:::['10-8-107']
oh, i know. we should've been more prepared.:::['10-8-108']
it's okay. now, the way i see it, our real competition now is cameron.:::['10-8-109']
my god, they just took her sweater off.:::['10-8-110']
look at those arms. hello, michelin man.:::['10-8-111']
oh, phoebe. whoo-hoo. come on! you know what, it's already 3:00.:::['10-8-112']
they haven't even gotten to emma's group yet. we got dinner.:::['10-8-113']
but emma's got what it takes. she could go all the way!:::['10-8-114']
phoebe, you have to calm down. ahem. okay.:::['10-8-115']
rachel, the hottest babies in the tri-state area are in this room right now.:::['10-8-116']
i overheard one judge say that not one of them holds a candle to emma.:::['10-8-117']
you heard him say that? yeah.:::['10-8-119']
all right. okay. all right, let's give these babies something to cry about.:::['10-8-120']
good. let's get down to business. emma needs some makeup.:::['10-8-121']
what? no... what?:::['10-8-122']
she's gonna look washed-out next to the others.:::['10-8-123']
no, i'm not letting you put makeup on my baby.:::['10-8-124']
why not? because i already did.:::['10-8-125']
oh! you bum! get off the ice! you suck! get off the ice, you idiot!:::['10-8-126']
what a game. i know. yeah.:::['10-8-127']
i can't believe chandler's missing this. i'm sorry he's not here.:::['10-8-128']
but i gotta say, i am really enjoying nacho chair.:::['10-8-129']
yeah, i'd probably enjoy it more if you didn't keep batting my hand away.:::['10-8-130']
all: oh!:::['10-8-131']
yeah! these seats are great.:::['10-8-132']
i know, i know. when i was here for "holidays on ice"......i was sitting so far away,michelle kwan couldn't read my banner.:::['10-8-133']
whoa, we'd better get going. if we don't leave now, we're gonna be late.:::['10-8-134']
but it's a tie game. so we're a little late. the girls will be there.:::['10-8-135']
let's just stay for one more goal.:::['10-8-136']
i don't know. one more fight.:::['10-8-137']
where is everybody? they're 45 minutes late.:::['10-8-139']
i can't believe they're not here. i slave and i slave for what?:::['10-8-140']
they've ruined cranberry day.:::['10-8-141']
how late are we? forty-five minutes.:::['10-8-142']
wow. here. yeah. okay.:::['10-8-143']
rachel and phoebe are already there, so they probably started without us.:::['10-8-144']
we could just slip in, and no one needs to know where we were.:::['10-8-145']
you may want to lose the foam finger. oh, no, no, no.:::['10-8-146']
you just want to put it on your hand.:::['10-8-147']
ross: hey. phoebe: oh.:::['10-8-148']
you...? you're not at thanksgiving? no. no, we're late.:::['10-8-149']
what are you doing here? we're late too.:::['10-8-150']
we figured we could be late because you'd be on time.:::['10-8-151']
don't point that thing at me, tribbiani.:::['10-8-152']
nobody's here? monica's gonna kill us. yeah, where were you?:::['10-8-153']
well... uh... ross: yeah, what's with the trophy?:::['10-8-154']
uh, well, uh... we were at a spelling bee.:::['10-8-155']
and i won.:::['10-8-156']
you won an adult thanksgiving day spelling bee?:::['10-8-157']
yes. y-e-s. yes.:::['10-8-158']
let me see this. "grand supreme little darling, new york division"?:::['10-8-159']
that's me. heh.:::['10-8-160']
you entered emma in a beauty pageant?:::['10-8-161']
and it looks like she put makeup on her.:::['10-8-162']
wait a second. where have i seen that cowgirl outfit before?:::['10-8-163']
i can't believe this. she's our daughter.:::['10-8-164']
that you would treat her like some kind of show dog is inexcusable.:::['10-8-165']
she won a thousand dollars. so this is an annual thing?:::['10-8-166']
that's alicia may emory's outfit!:::['10-8-167']
guys, there are people in there who are not getting any happier.:::['10-8-168']
what are we gonna do? figure it out. i gotta put emma down for a nap.:::['10-8-169']
and, rach, while you're in there, throw something on alicia may.:::['10-8-170']
all right, what are we gonna say? ooh! we'll say that we were mugged.:::['10-8-171']
you can't get mad at someone who's been mugged.:::['10-8-172']
good. but you don't look like you were mugged.:::['10-8-173']
no. here.:::['10-8-174']
do you hear something?:::['10-8-176']
they're out there.:::['10-8-177']
i can't believe this. they're an hour late... ...and they're just standing out there talking.:::['10-8-179']
everything's so distorted. it looks like joey has a giant hand.:::['10-8-180']
that says "rangers" on it. they went to the game.:::['10-8-181']
oh, they are in for a world of pain.:::['10-8-182']
ross' shirt is torn. they're late and they're sloppy.:::['10-8-183']
all right, emma's napping. what happened to your shirt?:::['10-8-184']
i got mugged, and they stole my pocket.:::['10-8-185']
we're just trying to figure out an excuse.:::['10-8-186']
hey, ooh! how about this?:::['10-8-187']
we could say that monica told us 5:00, not 4:00. that way we're right on time.:::['10-8-188']
or! or we could plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her.:::['10-8-189']
that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around.:::['10-8-190']
we'll just say that she said it was 5:00.:::['10-8-191']
we'll just act casual. we're not late, we're right on time.:::['10-8-192']
"we know you're out there.":::['10-8-193']
who do you think it's from?:::['10-8-194']
oh, god, this is bad. this is so bad.:::['10-8-195']
well, let's just go in there and face them.:::['10-8-196']
i'm not going in first. i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy.:::['10-8-197']
i hate that thing. it's like a bolt of lightning.:::['10-8-198']
i have an idea. why don't we play rock, paper, scissors. whoever loses, goes in first.:::['10-8-199']
joey: all right, i'm in. rachel: ready.:::['10-8-200']
ha, ha! i win.:::['10-8-201']
what is that? that's fire. it beats everything.:::['10-8-202']
oh, really? does it beat water balloon? pop-pssh. aw.:::['10-8-203']
well-played, phoebe buffay. well-played.:::['10-8-204']
all right, let's all go in at the same time.:::['10-8-205']
okay. okay. okay.:::['10-8-206']
it's locked. what? oh, sure, now they lock it.:::['10-8-207']
when they're having sex on the couch, it's like::::['10-8-208']
"come on in, my butt is surprisingly hairy!":::['10-8-209']
all right, come on. all right, you guys, we're so sorry we're late.:::['10-8-210']
please let us in so we can have dinner together.:::['10-8-211']
no, everything's cold. the turkey's dried out and the stuffing's all soggy.:::['10-8-212']
yeah, and there's a bowl of cranberry sauce that's...:::['10-8-213']
what happens to cranberry sauce?:::['10-8-214']
nothing, it's fine. oh, thank god.:::['10-8-215']
come on, you guys, we're sorry. our subway broke down.:::['10-8-216']
that's a lie! you went to the game. i can see joey's hand.:::['10-8-217']
for the love of god, take it off!:::['10-8-218']
guys, it doesn't matter why we're late. we're all here now.:::['10-8-219']
please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey.:::['10-8-220']
i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that.:::['10-8-221']
that's all the turkey you're gonna get.:::['10-8-222']
how are we gonna decide who gets this? water balloon!:::['10-8-223']
what are we gonna do? i'm starving.:::['10-8-224']
ah, oh! i just remembered, we do have something to eat.:::['10-8-225']
monica put something in our oven this morning.:::['10-8-226']
you touch that, and you will be sorry!:::['10-8-227']
guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it!:::['10-8-228']
ah! ha-ha-ha.:::['10-8-229']
oh, my god, it's brussels sprouts!:::['10-8-230']
that's worse than no food.:::['10-8-231']
ha, ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts.:::['10-8-232']
stinky?:::['10-8-233']
please let me stay on this side of the door.:::['10-8-234']
oh, i know! i still have my old key.:::['10-8-235']
joey: oh. we can just unlock the door.:::['10-8-236']
i don't know if that's a good idea. they don't wanna be with us.:::['10-8-237']
i don't wanna be with them either......but it's thanksgiving, and we should:::['10-8-238']
not want to be together together.:::['10-8-239']
if i could just get in there, make a face-to-face apology.:::['10-8-240']
look them in the eye, i could get them to forgive us.:::['10-8-241']
i don't know. i'm telling you......i can do it.:::['10-8-242']
yeah, he can do it.:::['10-8-243']
rachel: oh...:::['10-8-244']
aw. it all looks so beautiful.:::['10-8-245']
the turkey, the stuffing. the cranberries.:::['10-8-246']
ugh, enough! a monkey could've made them.:::['10-8-247']
hey, listen, guys, we feel really terrible.:::['10-8-248']
he's doing that weird eye-contact thing.:::['10-8-249']
don't look at him. don't look at him.:::['10-8-250']
come on, you guys. we want you to know we're very, very sorry.:::['10-8-251']
right, guys?:::['10-8-252']
ross: i feel terrible. rachel: oh, so sorry.:::['10-8-253']
but let's not ruin this day. you've worked so hard.:::['10-8-254']
let's move past this and try to have a nice meal all together, huh?:::['10-8-255']
the floating heads do make a good point.:::['10-8-256']
yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad.:::['10-8-257']
so bad. so bad. so bad.:::['10-8-258']
okay, you two go get the dessert, and i'll let you in.:::['10-8-260']
dessert?:::['10-8-261']
yeah, i asked you and phoebe to pick up the pies. you did remember, right?:::['10-8-262']
pies. oh, we thought you said "prize.":::['10-8-263']
"grand supreme little darling"? congratulations!:::['10-8-265']
oh, my god, you forgot the pies? well, i cannot believe this.:::['10-8-266']
you forced me to make dinner, you're an hour late......and you forget the one little thing:::['10-8-267']
that i asked you to do.:::['10-8-268']
really, girls, not cool.:::['10-8-269']
well, you man-heads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game.:::['10-8-270']
you knew it'd make you late, and you went anyway.:::['10-8-271']
hey, i'm getting a little tired of this. we said we're sorry.:::['10-8-272']
it's thanksgiving, for pete's sakes! a day of forgiveness.:::['10-8-273']
it's a day to be thankful. don't make me come up there!:::['10-8-274']
it's too late for apologies.:::['10-8-275']
fine, let's just go. i don't need your stupid dinner.:::['10-8-276']
that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.:::['10-8-277']
ew, is that what that is? sorry.:::['10-8-278']
come on, you guys, let's just do our own thanksgiving.:::['10-8-279']
yeah, i'll cook. yeah, let's go out.:::['10-8-280']
yeah, you three have a nice thanksgiving.:::['10-8-282']
the three of us? yeah. you, chan and the vein.:::['10-8-283']
uh-oh. i'm stuck. joey, that is not gonna work.:::['10-8-284']
no, seriously. unh.:::['10-8-285']
i'm really wedged in here. i'll pull you through.:::['10-8-286']
joey: okay.:::['10-8-287']
ow! stop, stop, i'm worried about damaging my head.:::['10-8-288']
it's a little late for that.:::['10-8-289']
hurry up, you gotta do something.:::['10-8-290']
all right, well, this does not change anything.:::['10-8-291']
we need to get something to grease his face.:::['10-8-292']
we got turkey grease. bring it.:::['10-8-293']
i just want to say that i'm sorry i referred to the vein as a separate person.:::['10-8-294']
oh, that smells good.:::['10-8-296']
okay? monica: okay, try it.:::['10-8-297']
gah! it isn't working.:::['10-8-298']
we're gonna have to unscrew the chain. hurry, i can't feel my ears.:::['10-8-299']
can you ever feel your ears?:::['10-8-300']
chandler, where are your tools? oh, i left them on my bulldozer.:::['10-8-302']
i don't have tools.:::['10-8-303']
well, i do, but rachel borrowed them. i lent them to ross.:::['10-8-304']
i gave them to joey. i left them at the park.:::['10-8-305']
i'm finding it really hard not to mess with him.:::['10-8-306']
i stuffed brussels sprouts down his pants.:::['10-8-307']
okay, i have to get that.:::['10-8-309']
now, when i get back, i want you and your friends to be gone.:::['10-8-310']
thanksgiving is over. the vein has spoken.:::['10-8-311']
it's really starting to hurt. look, i'm gonna pull on the door......and you guys push. maybe we can get:::['10-8-312']
enough room to wiggle him out, okay?:::['10-8-313']
okay, so push.:::['10-8-314']
just a sec. we're kind of in the middle of something here.:::['10-8-315']
ooh, ooh. stop putting things down my pants.:::['10-8-316']
come on, guys, push! yeah, come on, push!:::['10-8-317']
push! push!:::['10-8-318']
my cranberries! man, i got food all over me.:::['10-8-319']
i can't believe what you did. monica's gonna kill you.:::['10-8-320']
look! look! look what the... look what the floating heads did!:::['10-8-321']
that was the adoption agency.:::['10-8-324']
we're getting a baby! are you serious?:::['10-8-326']
there's a pregnant woman in ohio, and she picked us.:::['10-8-327']
oh, my god, that's great! ross: that's incredible.:::['10-8-328']
rachel: i'm so happy for you.:::['10-8-329']
this thanksgiving kicks last thanksgiving's ass!:::['10-8-330']
to monica and chandler and that knocked-up girl in ohio.:::['10-8-331']
i'm just so happy you guys are finally getting a kid.:::['10-8-332']
i know. have you considered pageanting?:::['10-8-333']
i can't believe they called. i mean, we're actually getting a baby.:::['10-8-334']
aw. i know how you feel.:::['10-8-335']
really? sure.:::['10-8-336']
i went through the exact same thing with alicia may emory.:::['10-8-337']
the waiting, the wondering.:::['10-8-338']
then one day, i get that call from toys"r"us.:::['10-8-339']
she was in stock.:::['10-8-340']
that is the exact same thing.:::['10-8-341']
ross kissed me. - no!:::['2-8-0']
oh, my god! oh, my god! oh, my god!:::['2-8-1', '2-8-3']

oh, it ended very well. - oh.:::['2-8-8']
do not start without me! do not start without me!:::['2-8-9']
okay. all right. let's hear about the kiss.:::['2-8-10']
was it like a soft brush against your lips......or was it like a, you know, "i gotta have you now" kind of thing?:::['2-8-11']
well, at first it was really intense, you know? and then...:::['2-8-12']
oh, god. and then we just sort of sunk into it.:::['2-8-13']
oh... so, okay, was he holding you? or were his hands on your back?:::['2-8-14']
no, actually, ahem, first they started out on my waist......and then they slid up and then they were in my hair.:::['2-8-15']
oh. phoebe: oh.:::['2-8-16']
and then i kissed her.:::['2-8-18']
tongue?:::['2-8-19']

wow. what are you gonna use it for?:::['2-8-35']
games and stuff.:::['2-8-36']
there are no jobs. there are no jobs for me.:::['2-8-37']
oh, wait, here's one. uh...:::['2-8-38']
would you be willing to cook naked? - there's an ad for a naked chef?:::['2-8-39']

and then... - mm.:::['2-8-41']
monica: hey. - oh, so how'd you make out last night?:::['2-8-43']
that is funny. that is painfully funny.:::['2-8-44']

well, go ahead, try a piece. - oh.:::['2-8-92']
yeah, we think that mockolate is even better than chocolate.:::['2-8-93']
all right. - ha, ha.:::['2-8-94']
i love how it crumbles.:::['2-8-97']
you see, chocolate doesn't do that. - ha-ha-ha. no, ma'am.:::['2-8-98']
anyhoo, we should be getting our fda approval any day now.:::['2-8-99']
rastatter: ha-ha-ha.:::['2-8-100']
hopefully, in time for thanksgiving. - mm.:::['2-8-101']
see, the way we look at it, chocolate dominates......your major food-preparation holidays. easter, christmas, what have you.:::['2-8-102']
mm-hm. - but we think given the right marketing......we can make thanksgiving the mockolate holiday.:::['2-8-103']
aren't you gonna swallow that? - ha, ha.:::['2-8-105']
just waiting for it to stop bubbling. - oh.:::['2-8-106']
yeah. isn't that great?:::['2-8-107']
mm. rastatter: ha-ha-ha.:::['2-8-108']
well, anyhoo, um......we're looking for chefs who can create thanksgiving-themed recipes.:::['2-8-109']
you interested?:::['2-8-110']
abso...:::['2-8-111']
ahem... . lutely!:::['2-8-112']
see, i love creating new recipes, i love thanksgiving, and, well, now......i love mockolate.:::['2-8-113']
really? - mm.:::['2-8-114']
especially that aftertaste. you know, i tell you......that'll last you till christmas.:::['2-8-115']
how about mockolate mousse?:::['2-8-116']
it's not......very thanksgiving-y.:::['2-8-117']
okay, how about pilgrim mockolate mousse?:::['2-8-118']
what makes it pilgrim?:::['2-8-119']
we'll put buckles on it.:::['2-8-120']
hey. - did ross call?:::['2-8-122']
monica: no, i'm sorry.:::['2-8-123']
why didn't he call?:::['2-8-124']
he's gonna stay with julie.:::['2-8-125']
he's gonna stay with her and she'll be::::['2-8-126']
"hi, i'm julie. ross picked me.:::['2-8-127']
we'll get married and have lots of kids and dig up stuff together!":::['2-8-128']
no offense, but that sounds nothing like her.:::['2-8-129']
i don't know what i'll do. what am i gonna do? this is like a complete nightmare!:::['2-8-130']
oh, i know. this must be so hard. "oh, no! two women love me!:::['2-8-131']
they're both gorgeous and sexy, my wallet's too small for my 50s......and my diamond shoes are too tight!":::['2-8-132']
hey, here's a thought, ross... - don't ever touch the computer.:::['2-8-133']
ross, listen. i got two words for you::::['2-8-134']
threesome.:::['2-8-135']
right, look. let's get logical about this. we'll make a list.:::['2-8-136']
"rachel and julie: pros and cons.":::['2-8-137']
oh. - oh.:::['2-8-138']
we'll put their names in bold with different fonts......and i can use different colors for each column.:::['2-8-139']
can't we just use a pen?:::['2-8-140']
no, amish boy.:::['2-8-141']
let's start with the cons because they're more fun.:::['2-8-142']
ha-ha-ha. rachel first.:::['2-8-143']
all right, i guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes.:::['2-8-146']
you could say that.:::['2-8-147']
ross: yeah.:::['2-8-148']
i guess, you know, sometimes she's a little ditzy, you know?:::['2-8-149']
and i've seen her be a little too into her looks.:::['2-8-150']
uh. oh, and julie and i have a lot in common......because we're both paleontologists, right?:::['2-8-151']
but rachel's just a waitress.:::['2-8-152']
waitress.:::['2-8-153']
got it. you guys wanna play "doom"?:::['2-8-154']
or we could keep doing this.:::['2-8-155']
what else?:::['2-8-156']
oh, her ankles are a little chubby.:::['2-8-158']
chandler: okay, let's do julie.:::['2-8-159']
what's wrong with her?:::['2-8-160']
she's not rachel.:::['2-8-161']
monica: okay. this is pumpkin pie with a mockolate crust.:::['2-8-162']
this is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate-chip cookies.:::['2-8-163']
just like the indians served.:::['2-8-164']
"oh, my god" good?:::['2-8-166']
oh, my god! i can't believe you let me put this in my mouth.:::['2-8-167']
oh! ugh!:::['2-8-168']
sweet lord! oh, this is what evil must taste like!:::['2-8-169']
i'm telling you, this thing won't print.:::['2-8-170']
yes, i pressed that button, like, 100 times.:::['2-8-171']
you know, for a hotline, you're not so hot.:::['2-8-172']
what is that in the background?:::['2-8-173']
are you watching star trek?:::['2-8-174']
so how'd it go with julie? did you break her heart?:::['2-8-176']
it was horrible. she cried, i cried. she threw things, they hit me.:::['2-8-178']
i did the right thing.:::['2-8-180']
so spock actually hugs his father?:::['2-8-181']
hey, do you guys have...?:::['2-8-182']
hi. - hi. - hi.:::['2-8-183']
i just got back from, uh...:::['2-8-185']
from julie's.:::['2-8-186']
uh, it's not what you think. um...:::['2-8-189']
it's the other thing.:::['2-8-190']
well, heh, ahem, what's the other thing? what do i think?:::['2-8-191']
he broke up with julie!:::['2-8-193']
well, go hug her, for god's sakes!:::['2-8-194']
it's always been you, rach.:::['2-8-197']
both: oh.:::['2-8-199', '2-15-15']
oh, this is good.:::['2-8-201']
this is really good. - i know. i know.:::['2-8-202']
it's almost...:::['2-8-203']
what do you say we go take a walk? just us. not them.:::['2-8-204']
okay. let me get my coat. - okay. no, hey, whoa, whoa.:::['2-8-205']
i'll get your coat.:::['2-8-206']
he's going to get my coat. he's going to get my coat, joey!:::['2-8-208']
oh, my god, you guys, i can't believe this! this is unbelievable!:::['2-8-209']
what's that? chandler: what? nothing!:::['2-8-210']
what? i saw my name. what is it? - no, no, see? see?:::['2-8-211']
hey, it's printing!:::['2-8-212', '2-8-213']
what is it? let me see!:::['2-8-214']
hey, someone order a coat?:::['2-8-215']
ross, chandler wrote something about me and he won't let me see.:::['2-8-216']
he won't? he won't!:::['2-8-217']
because isn't that......the short story you were writing?:::['2-8-218']
yes, it is a short story......that i was writing.:::['2-8-219']
and i'm in it? well, let me read it.:::['2-8-220']
come on! - hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?:::['2-8-221']
"it was summer.:::['2-8-223']
and it was hot.:::['2-8-224']
rachel was there. - eh?:::['2-8-225']
a lonely gray couch.:::['2-8-226']
'oh, look! ' cried ned.:::['2-8-227']
and then the kingdom was his forever. the end!":::['2-8-228']
that's it? that's all you wrote? you're the worst writer in the world!:::['2-8-229']
this isn't funny anymore.:::['2-8-230']
there's something about me on that piece of paper, and i want to see it.:::['2-8-231']
all right, you know what? fine. if you guys wanna be children, that's fine.:::['2-8-233']
i do not need to see it! - ha!:::['2-8-234']
chandler: go, go, go!:::['2-8-236', '3-9-318']
joey: ooh.:::['2-8-237']
what is this?:::['2-8-238', '3-15-20', '3-7-168']
chandler: that is...:::['2-8-239']
joey: no, no, no. ross: ah...:::['2-8-240']
ross, what is this?:::['2-8-241']
chandler: thank you. joey: good luck.:::['2-8-242']
okay. just remember how crazy i am about you, okay?:::['2-8-243']
"kind of ditzy"?:::['2-8-244']
ahem. "too into her looks"?:::['2-8-245']
"spoiled"?:::['2-8-246']
a little spoiled. he was supposed to type "little," the idiot!:::['2-8-247']
"just a waitress"?:::['2-8-248']
now, that was, uh...:::['2-8-249']
i mean, as opposed to, uh...:::['2-8-250']
the, um... okay, is this over yet? rach?:::['2-8-251']
ah! i do not have chubby ankles!:::['2-8-252']
no! i... no. rach, rach...:::['2-8-253']
okay, look at the other side. look at julie's column.:::['2-8-254']
"she's not rachem"?:::['2-8-255']
no... - what the hell's a rachem?:::['2-8-256']
no, no... - is that some stupid paleontology word......that i wouldn't know because i'm just a waitress?:::['2-8-257']
no. rach, come on! rach...:::['2-8-258']
rach! rach! no, no!:::['2-8-259']
it's "she's not rachel"! she's not...:::['2-8-260']
my diary. my diary! that's brilliant!:::['2-8-262']
if i'd said it was my diary, she wouldn't have made me read it.:::['2-8-263']
no, that's true. you'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency.:::['2-8-264']
i cannot believe ross even made this list.:::['2-8-265']
i know. - what a dinkus!:::['2-8-266']
hey, cut him some slack. it was chandler's idea.:::['2-8-267']
oh, good. i was hoping that would come up.:::['2-8-269']
this was your idea? phoebe: what?:::['2-8-270']
let's get some perspective here, okay? these things happen for a reason.:::['2-8-271']
yeah. you!:::['2-8-272']
all right, pheebs, back me up here. you believe in that karma crap, don't you?:::['2-8-273']
yeah. listen, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle.:::['2-8-274']
ross: rach! whoa...:::['2-8-275']
rach!:::['2-8-276']
hey! uh, open up! please?:::['2-8-277']
when somebody does not buzz you in, ross, that means, "go away.":::['2-8-278']
that doesn't mean, "climb up the fire escape.":::['2-8-279']
i just want to read you something, your "pro list.":::['2-8-280']
not interested.:::['2-8-281']
"number one: the way you cry at game shows. aw.:::['2-8-283']
number two: how much you love your friends.:::['2-8-284']
number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous.:::['2-8-285']
number four: how brave you are for starting your life over.:::['2-8-286']
number five: how great you are with ben.:::['2-8-287']
number six: the way you smell.":::['2-8-288']
joey, you wanna open the window?:::['2-8-290']
what are you doing out there? - i'm, um...:::['2-8-292']
my gosh, you must be freezing. you know what you need?:::['2-8-293']
how about a nice, steaming cup of hot mockolate?:::['2-8-294']
rach, come on, open up.:::['2-8-295']
rach, come on. come on. you gotta give me another chance.:::['2-8-296']
no? - that's what i said.:::['2-8-298']
maybe we should go.:::['2-8-299']
no, you don't have to go. we're done talking.:::['2-8-300']
rach, come on. i know how you must...:::['2-8-301']
no, you don't, ross.:::['2-8-302']
imagine the worst things you think about yourself.:::['2-8-303']
now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world......not only thinks them too......but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you.:::['2-8-304']
no, but see, i wanna be with you in spite of all those things.:::['2-8-305']
oh. well, that's mighty big of you, ross.:::['2-8-306']
i said, don't go!:::['2-8-307']
if things were the other way around, there is nothing you could put on a list......that would ever make me not wanna be with you.:::['2-8-309']
well, then i guess that's the difference between us.:::['2-8-310']
see, i'd never make a list.:::['2-8-311']
i never know how long you're supposed to wait in this situation before you can talk.:::['2-8-312']
maybe a little longer.:::['2-8-313']
in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem a little unusual.:::['2-8-314']
uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars?:::['2-8-315']
i've indicated four cups of coconut and four cups of crushed nuts......and only one tablespoon of mockolate.:::['2-8-316']
doesn't matter.:::['2-8-317']
our fda approval didn't come through.:::['2-8-319']
something about laboratory rats. huh.:::['2-8-320']
oh, gosh, i'm sorry. - yeah. well, anyhoo, here's your check.:::['2-8-321']
thank you for all you went through.:::['2-8-322']
um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?:::['2-8-323']
well, i ate some.:::['2-8-324']
oh, some. that's fine. some's not a lot.:::['2-8-325']
ha-ha-ha. - okay.:::['2-8-326']
so it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?:::['2-8-327']
is that him again?:::['2-8-330']
tell him i'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighing me down.:::['2-8-331']
listen, i don't think this is the best time.:::['2-8-332']
look, can you do something for me?:::['2-8-333']
sure. what?:::['2-8-334']
music?:::['2-8-337']
sure. - okay.:::['2-8-338']
rachel, he wants you to know he's sorry for what he did......and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him.:::['2-8-339']
<i>see the stone set in your eyes</i>:::['2-8-340']
<i>see the thorn twist in your side</i>:::['2-8-341']
<i>i'll wait for you</i>:::['2-8-342']
<i>sleight of hand and twist of fate</i>:::['2-8-343']
<i>on a bed of nails she makes me wait</i>:::['2-8-344']
<i>and i'll wait without you</i>:::['2-8-345']
woman: uh, we've just gotten a call from rachel......and she told us what ross did.:::['2-8-346']
it's pretty appalling. and, ross, if you're listening......i don't wanna play your song anymore.:::['2-8-347']
why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance?:::['2-8-348']
avery, michelle's sorry she hit you with her car......and she hopes you two will work it out.:::['2-8-349']
<i>there's a room where</i>:::['2-8-350']
<i>i can go and</i>:::['2-8-351']
<i>tell my secrets to</i>:::['2-8-352']
<i>in my room</i>:::['2-8-353', '2-8-355']
<i>in my room, in my room</i>:::['2-8-354']
hi. thanks for coming in again.:::['2-8-356']
oh, not at all. i have no morals, and i need the cash.:::['2-8-357']
it's like i'm looking in a mirror. ha-ha-ha.:::['2-8-358']
anyway, they're called fish-tachios.:::['2-8-359']
now, they taste exactly like pistachios......but they're made of reconstituted fish bits.:::['2-8-360']
here, try one.:::['2-8-361']
all right. - you're not allergic to anything?:::['2-8-362']
uh, cat hair. - oh, sorry.:::['2-8-363']
joey, would you slow down?:::['2-10-0']
they're not gonna be sold out of papers at 1:00 in the morning.:::['2-10-1']
i'm excited. i've never gotten reviewed before.:::['2-10-2']
you were so amazing as the king. i'm really impressed. i was.:::['2-10-3']
phoebe: but you know what?:::['2-10-4']
you might wanna consider wearing underwear next time.:::['2-10-5']
because when you sat on your throne, you could kind of see your......royal subjects.:::['2-10-6']
here it is. here it is.:::['2-10-7']
"the only thing worse than the mindless adolescent direction......was joseph tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king.":::['2-10-8']
okay, look. that is one guy's opinion.:::['2-10-9']
all right? pheebs, read yours. - okay.:::['2-10-10']
"the only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction...":::['2-10-11']
does anybody have one from a different paper?:::['2-10-12']
ross, read yours.:::['2-10-13']
i don't want to.:::['2-10-14', '4-11-274']
joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about.:::['2-10-15']
maybe they do.:::['2-10-16']
i've been doing this 10 years and i haven't gotten anywhere.:::['2-10-17']
there's gotta be a reason.:::['2-10-18']
come on, man, you're just, uh, paying your dues.:::['2-10-19']
no, no, no. it's too hard.:::['2-10-20']
it's not worth it. i quit.:::['2-10-21']
rachel: what? ross: that's crazy.:::['2-10-22']
wait, wait one minute. wait a minute.:::['2-10-23']
i believe this will change your mind.:::['2-10-24']
"in a mediocre play, joseph tribbiani was able to achieve brilliant new levels of...":::['2-10-25']
continued on page 153.:::['2-10-26']
"...sucking.":::['2-10-27']
friends s02e10: the one with russ:::['2-10-28']
when i was little, i wanted to be a veterinarian.:::['2-10-40']
but then i found out you have to put your hands into cows and stuff.:::['2-10-41']
phoebe: are you okay?:::['2-10-43']
yeah, just a tough day at work, you know?:::['2-10-44']
stegosaurus fell over, trapped a kid.:::['2-10-45']
i know this jacket. this is fun bobby's jacket.:::['2-10-46']
where is he? what? he's here, isn't he?:::['2-10-47']
maybe. - don't toy with me.:::['2-10-48']
geller! - hey, fun bobby.:::['2-10-49']
whoa, hey. you been working out?:::['2-10-50']
i love this guy.:::['2-10-52']
i was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister.:::['2-10-53']
you and me both. - so, what'd i miss? come on.:::['2-10-54']
oh. we were trying to make joey feel better.:::['2-10-55']
hey, do you need me to pick you up? - no, i'm all right, man, really.:::['2-10-56']
no, i'm picking you up.:::['2-10-57']
hey, no, seriously. i don't need you to...:::['2-10-58']
all right, it still works. - okay.:::['2-10-59']

i'm still gonna go.:::['2-10-61']
okay, i'll see you later, babe. bobby: ah.:::['2-10-62']
public display of affection coming up. you can avert your eyes.:::['2-10-63']
see you. all: bye.:::['2-10-65']
fun bobby is so great.:::['2-10-66']
oh, isn't he?:::['2-10-67']
i really think this time it may work with him. i mean, he makes me feel so good.:::['2-10-68']
and i've been feeling so lousy, you know, no job, no boyfriend.:::['2-10-69']
well, at least my cup is half full.:::['2-10-70']
half full of love.:::['2-10-71']
and for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin.:::['2-10-72']
cabin of love.:::['2-10-73']
we went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys.:::['2-10-74']
really? i only had two glasses. - i just had a glass.:::['2-10-75']
two. - i had one glass.:::['2-10-76']
i had about a mug full in this lovely......"i got boned at the museum of natural history" mug.:::['2-10-77']
okay, so that's, what? two bottles.:::['2-10-78']
and yet somehow we went through five?:::['2-10-79']
chandler: whoa.:::['2-10-80']
so what? so he drank a lot tonight.:::['2-10-82']
yeah, but, you know, now that i think about it......i don't think i've ever seen fun bobby without a drink in his hand.:::['2-10-83']
phoebe: yeah. ooh, ooh, yeah, you know?:::['2-10-84']
did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um::::['2-10-85']
"okay, i was so wasted," or, "oh, we were so bombed.":::['2-10-86']
or, um, "so i wake up and i'm in this dumpster in connecticut.":::['2-10-87']
monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?:::['2-10-88']
well, we just happen to go to a lot of places where you might drink.:::['2-10-89']
i mean, how do you go to a wine-tasting without having a drink?:::['2-10-90']
or to a club, or to the......zoo.:::['2-10-91']
rach, does this have nonfat milk?:::['2-10-92']
um, i don't know, why don't you taste it?:::['2-10-93']
mm. no.:::['2-10-94']
oh, well, too late, you already had some.:::['2-10-95']
what do you say we make these, uh, coffees irish?:::['2-10-96']
um, cake.:::['2-10-97']
yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake.:::['2-10-98']
you know, it seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff irish lately.:::['2-10-99']
i would make them belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask.:::['2-10-100']
bobby.:::['2-10-101']
look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, i don't know.:::['2-10-103']
but, um, i'm kind of worried about you.:::['2-10-104']
okay, look, this isn't the first time somebody said something to me about this.:::['2-10-105']
but, i don't know, i always made excuses, like "i'm just a social drinker.":::['2-10-106']
or "hey, come on, it's flag day.":::['2-10-107']
so, what are you saying now?:::['2-10-108']
i guess i'm saying......i'll try and quit.:::['2-10-109']
i kind of like that you worry about me.:::['2-10-110']
i am gonna try and quit drinking.:::['2-10-112']
oh. why?:::['2-10-113', '5-8-115']
monica: hey. phoebe: hey.:::['2-10-115', '4-21-161']
guess who's back in show business.:::['2-10-116']
ooh, ooh. lorne greene?:::['2-10-117']
no, pheebs. you know why? because he's dead.:::['2-10-118']

no, no, i'm not mad at him.:::['2-10-134']
i'm not really anything at him anymore.:::['2-10-135']
what are you talking about? - i don't know.:::['2-10-136']
whatever i was feeling, i'm... not.:::['2-10-137']
but you guys came so close.:::['2-10-138']
oh, i know. i'm sorry, you guys. you're gonna have to get used to the fact......that i will not be dating ross.:::['2-10-139']
here he is. hi.:::['2-10-140']
guys, this is russ.:::['2-10-141']
no, no, no. i'm not saying you're not talented. you're very talented.:::['2-10-143']
it's just that with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left.:::['2-10-144']
oh, honey, give me a break, will you? oh, oh. i'll talk to you later.:::['2-10-145']
well, there's my favorite client.:::['2-10-146']

no. - well, here it is.:::['2-10-150']
okay. uh, listen, there's something i want to talk to you about.:::['2-10-151']
the network casting lady... - oh, isn't lori a doll?:::['2-10-152']
yeah, yeah, she's great.:::['2-10-153']
but i kind of got the feeling that she was sort of coming on to me.:::['2-10-154']
and i definitely would get the part if i were to, you know...:::['2-10-155']
lf i would have sent the little general in. - oh.:::['2-10-156']
i see. well, i'm just gonna put in a call here......and we'll find out what's going on and straighten it out.:::['2-10-157']
yeah, hi. lori, please.:::['2-10-158']
hi, darling.:::['2-10-159']
so how about joey tribbiani for the part of the cab driver?:::['2-10-160']
isn't he terrific?:::['2-10-161']
okay, doll, talk to you later.:::['2-10-163']
yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her.:::['2-10-164']
rachel: what's the matter? monica: fun bobby.:::['2-10-165']
what? isn't he sober?:::['2-10-166']
oh, he's sober all right.:::['2-10-167']
just turns out that fun bobby was fun for a reason.:::['2-10-168']
ah. okay.:::['2-10-169']
all right, here you go, sweetie.:::['2-10-170']
bobby: thanks. you wanna hear something funny?:::['2-10-171']
oh, god, yes.:::['2-10-172']
there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the village.:::['2-10-173']
that is funny.:::['2-10-174', '2-21-53']
i needed to buy a hammer the other night......and i'm out walking around the neighborhood.:::['2-10-175']
but apparently......there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the village.:::['2-10-176']
uh, say, honey, don't you have to be at your interview?:::['2-10-177']
bobby: see you guys. chandler: bye......ridiculously dull bobby.:::['2-10-179']
oh, my god. - he's not that bad.:::['2-10-180']
not that bad? did you not hear the hammer story?:::['2-10-181']
okay, okay, don't get all squinky.:::['2-10-182']
maybe it was just the kind of story where you had to be there.:::['2-10-183']
but i'm gonna be there.:::['2-10-184']
for the rest of my life.:::['2-10-185']
i can't break up with him. i made him quit drinking.:::['2-10-186']
he's dull because of me. - all right, don't say that.:::['2-10-187']
he's probably always been dull. you just, you know......set it free.:::['2-10-188']
hi. - hey, ross. ah.:::['2-10-189']
rachel: hi, russ.:::['2-10-190']
i've just got two more tables to clean, and then we'll go, okay?:::['2-10-191']
okay. i'll just sit here and, uh......chat with your, uh......friend-type people.:::['2-10-192']
rachel? um, hi.:::['2-10-193']
hi. - okay.:::['2-10-194']
so you know what you're doing, right?:::['2-10-195']
ha, ha. waitressing?:::['2-10-196']
well, yeah. but, no. i mean, um...:::['2-10-197']
doesn't russ just remind you of someone?:::['2-10-198']
huh. bob saget? - oh, yeah.:::['2-10-199']
no, no, no. oh, oh. - hi.:::['2-10-200']
oh, my, oh.:::['2-10-201']
what...? what's wrong?:::['2-10-202']
i... okay. - she's just upset because she, uh...:::['2-10-203']
she buttered a spider into her toast this morning.:::['2-10-204']
listen, pheebs. this is gonna be okay.:::['2-10-207']
ross, russ. russ, ross.:::['2-10-208']
are you a, uh, friend of rachel's?:::['2-10-210', '2-10-212']
actually, i'm, uh, kind of a......you know......a date-type thing......of rachel's.:::['2-10-213']
a date? - yeah. i'm her date.:::['2-10-214']
oh. oh, you're, uh...:::['2-10-215']
oh, you're the date.:::['2-10-216']
you know, this is actually good......because if we ever lose ross, we have a spare.:::['2-10-217']
oh. you are the, uh, paleontologist.:::['2-10-218']
yes. yes, i am. and you are a...:::['2-10-219']
periodontist.:::['2-10-220']
see? now they're as different as night and......later that night.:::['2-10-221']
well, i am going to, uh, get a beverage. heh.:::['2-10-222']
uh, it was nice, uh, meeting you. - ditto.:::['2-10-223']
i, uh... well, i met russ.:::['2-10-224']
hey, i didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people.:::['2-10-226']
well, we're not seeing each other, so... - huh.:::['2-10-227']
well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum......who's curator of moths and other, uh......winged things......who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me, much like a......you know. ahem.:::['2-10-228']
well, so far i've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal...:::['2-10-229']
yeah, this is the deal.:::['2-10-230']
okay, well, um, have a nice evening. - thank you.:::['2-10-231']
russ, are you ready? - yeah.:::['2-10-232']
rachel: bye. monica: bye.:::['2-10-233']
she's dating?:::['2-10-234', '2-10-235']
yes. yes, but did you see who she was dating?:::['2-10-236']
do you not see it? - see what?:::['2-10-238']
i don't know what she sees in that goober.:::['2-10-239']
it takes him, what? like, i don't know, uh......hello, a week to get out a sentence?:::['2-10-240']
yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?:::['2-10-241']
i'm guessing you didn't get the part......or, uh, italy called and said it was hungry?:::['2-10-245']
well, the part's mine if i want it.:::['2-10-246']
yeah. if i'm willing to sleep with the casting lady.:::['2-10-248']
oh, my......god?:::['2-10-249']
ten years i've been waiting for a break like this, chandler. ten years.:::['2-10-250']
i mean, days of our lives. that's actually on television.:::['2-10-251']
i guess i could sleep with her. i mean...:::['2-10-253']
how can i do that?:::['2-10-254']
well, i've got a pop-up book that told me everything i needed to know.:::['2-10-255']
i've never slept with someone for a part.:::['2-10-256']
well, is she...?:::['2-10-257']
is she good-looking? - yeah.:::['2-10-259']
she's totally good-looking. i mean, if i met her in a bar or something......i'd be buying her breakfast.:::['2-10-260']
you know, after having slept with her.:::['2-10-261']
you know, maybe this isn't such a big deal.:::['2-10-262']
i mean, the way that i see it is, you get a great job and you get to have sex.:::['2-10-263']
you know? throw in a tree and a fat guy, and you've got christmas.:::['2-10-264']
i just... i just don't think that i want it that way though, you know?:::['2-10-265']
i mean, let's say i do make it, all right?:::['2-10-266']
i'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent......or because of, you know, the little general.:::['2-10-267']
didn't you used to call it the little major?:::['2-10-268']
yeah, but after denise demarco, i had to promote it.:::['2-10-269']
can i get you something from the bar?:::['2-10-270']
yes, i would like something.:::['2-10-271']
no. no, thank you.:::['2-10-272']
no, if you want a drink, it's okay with me. i've gotta get used to it.:::['2-10-273']
no, no, really. i wouldn't feel right about it.:::['2-10-274']
just some water, please.:::['2-10-275']
so the light went out in my refrigerator. - scotch on the rocks with a twist.:::['2-10-276']
hey, we're having some fun now, huh, ross?:::['2-10-278']
wanna do another one? huh, russ?:::['2-10-279']
okay. eleven letters......atomic element number 101, ends in "ium.":::['2-10-280']
dysprosium. - ha, ha. dysprosium.:::['2-10-281']
try mendelevium.:::['2-10-282']
and weenie number two has it.:::['2-10-283']
unless of course 9 down, "nights in white satin" was sung by the doody blues.:::['2-10-284']
you don't see it? you actually don't see it?:::['2-10-285']
what? - okay, honey, you're dating ross.:::['2-10-286']
no, pheebs, i'm dating russ.:::['2-10-287']
russ is ross. russ, ross.:::['2-10-288']
steve, sleeve.:::['2-10-289']
okay, no one is named sleeve.:::['2-10-290']
phoebe, what the hell are we talking about?:::['2-10-291']
other than their names being similar, i'm sorry, i do not see what you're seeing.:::['2-10-292']
for your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark.:::['2-10-293']
you could not be more wrong.:::['2-10-294']
you could try, but you would not be successful.:::['2-10-295']
okay, i'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins.:::['2-10-296']
i know what your problem is. - oh, you do, do you?:::['2-10-297']
mm-hm. you're jealous.:::['2-10-298']
uh, of what?:::['2-10-299']
you're jealous because i'm a real doctor.:::['2-10-300']
hey, you're a doctor of gums.:::['2-10-301']
that's the smallest body part you can major in.:::['2-10-302']
it's like, day one, floss. day two, here's your diploma.:::['2-10-303']
now, you listen... - no, no.:::['2-10-304']
ross: let me finish. russ: no, let me finish.:::['2-10-305']
no, you let me fin...:::['2-10-306']
did joey say what he was gonna do? chandler: no.:::['2-10-310']
i don't even think he knew.:::['2-10-311']
hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?:::['2-10-312']
i don't know. who would i have to sleep with?:::['2-10-313']
why would i have to sleep with you?:::['2-10-315']
it's my game. you want the job or not?:::['2-10-316']
good morning. - where you going?:::['2-10-318']
bobby and i are going away for the weekend. remember?:::['2-10-319']
phoebe: what's with all the bottles of liquor?:::['2-10-321']
what's going on? is, uh, bobby drinking again?:::['2-10-322']
oh, no, this is not for him. this is for me.:::['2-10-323']
that way, he's still sober, but i find his stories about shoelaces more amusing.:::['2-10-324']
ugh, god. even his knock is boring.:::['2-10-325']
hi. i'll be ready in just a second. - uh, could i talk to you a minute?:::['2-10-326']
this is really hard for me to say. - oh, god. you fell off the wagon.:::['2-10-328']
oh, no, no.:::['2-10-329', '5-3-97', '5-17-35']
it's about you.:::['2-10-330']
i think you may have a drinking problem.:::['2-10-332']
what, these?:::['2-10-333']
no, these are, um, for cuts and scrapes.:::['2-10-334']
look, i am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now.:::['2-10-335']
oh, shoot.:::['2-10-336']
well, anyway, i hope we can be friends.:::['2-10-337']
take care.:::['2-10-339', '2-12-301', '2-16-365']
okay. you too. - bye.:::['2-10-340']
well, we kind of broke up.:::['2-10-342']
does anybody want these?:::['2-10-344']
i'll take one.:::['2-10-345']
sometimes i like to hold stuff like this and pretend i'm a giant.:::['2-10-346']
hey. - hey. how'd the callback go?:::['2-10-347']
ugh, it was unbelievable. i walked in there and she was all over me.:::['2-10-348']
so, what did you do? - well, i couldn't do it.:::['2-10-349']
i told her i didn't want the part that way. - good for you.:::['2-10-350']
oh, wait, wait, wait. but then after i left her office......she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.:::['2-10-351']
so, and?:::['2-10-352']
so you are now looking at dr. drake ramoray, neurosurgeon......recurring in at least four episodes.:::['2-10-353']
chandler: all right!:::['2-10-354']
all right, i gotta go shower.:::['2-10-355']
oh, hey. - hi.:::['2-10-357']
i guess you guys heard rachel dumped me.:::['2-10-358']
yeah, i'm sorry, man.:::['2-10-359']
all she said was that i remind her too much of somebody.:::['2-10-360']
you have any idea who she's talking about?:::['2-10-361']
oh, i do. it's bob saget.:::['2-10-362']
she hates him. russ: oh.:::['2-10-363']
hey. chandler: hey, julie.:::['2-10-364']
phoebe: hey, how are you doing?:::['2-10-365']
oh. i don't know. i mean, it's definitely weird not being with ross......but i guess i'm doing okay.:::['2-10-366']
actually, i've got some of his stuff that he, um...:::['2-10-367']
ross: okay, here's his diaper bag......and his, uh, mr. winky. ha, ha. susan: ha, ha.:::['2-11-0']
him. hi!:::['2-11-3']
how did everything go? ross: great.:::['2-11-4']
there was a projectile, uh......throwing up incident, but he started it.:::['2-11-5']
ha, ha. we've gotta go. - okay.:::['2-11-6']
oh, right. um...:::['2-11-7']
i've got some news. it's about us.:::['2-11-8']
oh, you and me? - uh, no. susan and me.:::['2-11-9']
the other "us.":::['2-11-10']
we're getting married.:::['2-11-12']
as in, "i now pronounce you wife and wife" married?:::['2-11-13']
we'd like you to come. we understand if you don't want to.:::['2-11-14']
why wouldn't i want to come? i had fun at the first wedding.:::['2-11-15']
i just thought that...:::['2-11-16']
why shouldn't i be happy for you? what would it say about me......if i couldn't, uh, revel in your joy?:::['2-11-17']
and i'm reveling, baby. believe me.:::['2-11-18']
is your finger caught in that chair?:::['2-11-19']
want us to go? - uh-huh.:::['2-11-21']
friends s02e11: the one with the lesbian wedding:::['2-11-22']
marlena: you're clearly bothered by something. tell me what it is.:::['2-11-34']
this is cool. you're actually on television.:::['2-11-35']
i know. it really hit me last night.:::['2-11-36']
i'm on days of our lives.:::['2-11-37']
then i started thinking about us, and how these are the days of our lives.:::['2-11-38']
yes! - what?:::['2-11-39']
carol and susan's caterer had a bike accident......and she's in a full-body cast.:::['2-11-40']
they asked me, which is cool since i've never catered......and i need the money. is this a problem?:::['2-11-42']
would it matter? - you're so great!:::['2-11-43']
you're really not going? - i'm really not.:::['2-11-45']
they already live together. why do they need to get married?:::['2-11-46']
they love each other.:::['2-11-47']
they wanna celebrate that love with the people close to them.:::['2-11-48']
if you wanna call that a reason.:::['2-11-49']
who's the bitterest man in the living room?:::['2-11-50']
the bitterest man in the living room?:::['2-11-51']
hi, neighbor.:::['2-11-52']
i thought you were over this. - that has nothing to do with it.:::['2-11-53']
if she were marrying a guy, you wouldn't expect me to go.:::['2-11-54']
if she were marrying a guy, she'd be the worst lesbian ever.:::['2-11-55']
no, i'm on right after this guy shoots himself.:::['2-11-57']
whoa, she's pretty.:::['2-11-58']
and she's really nice.:::['2-11-59']
she taught me about how to work with the cameras......and smell-the-fart acting.:::['2-11-60']
rachel: i'm sorry, what? ross: excuse me?:::['2-11-61']
you got so many lines to learn so fast that sometimes......you need a minute to remember your next one.:::['2-11-62']
so while you're thinking......you take this big pause where you look all intense.:::['2-11-63']
like this::::['2-11-64']
all: oh. chandler: okay.:::['2-11-65']
mrs. wallace? - yes.:::['2-11-67']
i'm dr. drake ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.:::['2-11-68']
woman: is she going to be all right?:::['2-11-69']
i'm afraid the situation is much more dire than we'd expected.:::['2-11-70']
your sister's suffering from a......subcranial hematoma.:::['2-11-71']
perhaps we can discuss this further over coffee.:::['2-11-72']
nice!:::['2-11-73', '5-9-175']
for a minute, i thought you were actually smelling something.:::['2-11-74']
ross: do it again! monica: all right!:::['2-11-75']
chandler: that was so good! ross: do it again.:::['2-11-76']
"damn it, braverman! it's right there on the chart!":::['2-11-77']
i gotta get to work. i got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.:::['2-11-78']
no, that's me.:::['2-11-79']
ross: oh. chandler: oh.:::['2-11-81']
oh, thanks. couldn't, uh...:::['2-11-82']
um, no. uh-uh. um...:::['2-11-84']
one of my clients died on the massage table today.:::['2-11-85']
that's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.:::['2-11-87']
yeah, uh-huh.:::['2-11-88']
um, she was, you know, 82 years old......and her name was, um, mrs. adelman.:::['2-11-89']
it's just so strange. you know......she probably woke up this morning and thought......i'll have some breakfast, take a walk, then have my massage.:::['2-11-91']
little did she know god thought, "okay, but that's it.":::['2-11-92']
oh, but the weirdest thing was......i was cleansing her aura when it happened.:::['2-11-93']
and when her spirit left her body......i don't think it went very far.:::['2-11-94']
i think it went into me.:::['2-11-96']
this is so hard.:::['2-11-97', '2-16-149']
i can't decide between lamb or duck.:::['2-11-98']
well, lambs are scarier.:::['2-11-99']
or the movie would've been called silence of the ducks.:::['2-11-100']
okay, who ordered what?:::['2-11-101']
i had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.:::['2-11-102']
and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?:::['2-11-103']
you're so uptight about your mom coming.:::['2-11-105']
i know. i just don't want her to think that because......i didn't marry barry my life is crap.:::['2-11-106']
talk about crap, just listen to stella neidman......tell her story about rod steiger for the hundredth time.:::['2-11-107']
uh, pheebs? how long do you think this lady will be with us?:::['2-11-108']
i don't know. she obviously has some unfinished business.:::['2-11-109']
sit up!:::['2-11-110']
there she is!:::['2-11-111', '2-14-280', '5-17-122']
mom! sandra: hey, sweetie!:::['2-11-112']
so this is where you work!:::['2-11-113']
oh, it's wonderful!:::['2-11-114']
is it a living room? is it a restaurant? who can tell?:::['2-11-115']
i guess that's the fun.:::['2-11-116']
pretty much. here, meet my friends.:::['2-11-117']
monica! you look gorgeous!:::['2-11-118']
oh, my! the last time i saw you, it was eat or be eaten.:::['2-11-119']
uh, this is joey.:::['2-11-120']
this is phoebe.:::['2-11-121']
this is chandler.:::['2-11-122']
you remember ross?:::['2-11-123']
oh, hello, ross. - hi, mrs. green.:::['2-11-124']
what do you think of my daughter, in the apron......with the big job!:::['2-11-125']
oh, mom!:::['2-11-126']
if you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.:::['2-11-127']
believe me, sometimes that happens.:::['2-11-128']
this is just so exciting! you know, i never worked.:::['2-11-129']
i went from my father's house to the sorority house......to my husband's house. i am just so proud of you!:::['2-11-130']
i know who you remind me of.:::['2-11-132']
evelyn durmer.:::['2-11-133']
that's before the lousy face-lift. now she looks like soupy sales.:::['2-11-134']
pheebs? ha, ha. who's evelyn durmer?:::['2-11-135']
i don't know. who's soupy sales?:::['2-11-136']
sandra: oh, my god!:::['2-11-137']
there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.:::['2-11-138']
just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.:::['2-11-139']
you have some life here, sweetie!:::['2-11-140']
mom, i realize you were upset when i didn't marry barry......and get the house in the suburbs with all the security.:::['2-11-141']
this is just so much better for me.:::['2-11-142']
i know. you didn't love barry, honey.:::['2-11-143']
and i've never seen you this happy.:::['2-11-144']
i look at you and i think, "this is what i want.":::['2-11-145']
well, not just for you.:::['2-11-147']
i'm, uh, considering leaving your father.:::['2-11-149']
all right, tell me if this is too cute.:::['2-11-150']
lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.:::['2-11-151']
oh, god. i think i'm gonna be sick.:::['2-11-152']
what? it's not like i'm putting little nipples on them.:::['2-11-153']
you had no idea? - none.:::['2-11-154']
they didn't fight?:::['2-11-155']
no, they didn't even talk to each other.:::['2-11-156']
how was i suppose to know they were having problems?:::['2-11-157']
you know, in my day, divorce was not an option.:::['2-11-158']
hey, look who's up!:::['2-11-159']
i just can't believe this is happening.:::['2-11-160']
when i was little, all parents got divorced.:::['2-11-161']
i figured as an adult, i wouldn't have to worry about it.:::['2-11-162']
can't you look at this as flattering?:::['2-11-163']
she just wants to be like you.:::['2-11-164']
well, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?:::['2-11-165']
when my parents divorced, they sent me to a shrink......and she told me that kids blame themselves.:::['2-11-166']
but in your case, it's actually kind of true.:::['2-11-167']
oh, that's him.:::['2-11-168']
damn. my mail-order grandfather hasn't come yet.:::['2-11-169']
phoebe? - hi, mr. adelman.:::['2-11-170']
nice to see you. - thanks for coming.:::['2-11-171']
that's okay. although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.:::['2-11-172']
um, do you wanna sit?:::['2-11-173']
no, i spent most of my morning trying to stand up.:::['2-11-174']
what can i do for you, my dear?:::['2-11-175']
okay, i don't know how to say this, but, um......i think when your wife's spirit left her body......it, um, kind of stuck around......in me.:::['2-11-176']
you're saying my wife is in you?:::['2-11-177']
yeah. you don't have to believe me, but......um, can you think of any unfinished business she had?:::['2-11-178']
any reason to hang around?:::['2-11-179']
all i can think of is that......she used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.:::['2-11-181']
everything? - everything.:::['2-11-182']
whoa. that's a lot of stuff.:::['2-11-183']
oh, wait, i...:::['2-11-184']
i remember she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.:::['2-11-185']
i'm sorry. there's laughing in my head.:::['2-11-186']
worth a shot, huh?:::['2-11-187']
sandra: ha, ha. look at this.:::['2-11-188']
these are all halloween, three years ago.:::['2-11-189']
oh, and look, here's barry.:::['2-11-190']
he came straight from the office?:::['2-11-191']
oh, no. that was his costume.:::['2-11-192']
see, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.:::['2-11-193']
um, you guys?:::['2-11-194']
remember when i said that i don't need your help?:::['2-11-195']
actually, i think you said::::['2-11-196']
"don't touch that and get out of my kitchen.":::['2-11-197']
really? weird. anyway...:::['2-11-198']
i planned really well. i planned and planned.:::['2-11-199']
i just didn't plan enough time to do it.:::['2-11-200']
you want some help? - if you want.:::['2-11-201']
what a day.:::['2-11-203']
i took her everywhere.:::['2-11-204']
the museum of modern art, rockefeller center......the statue of liberty.:::['2-11-205']
she's still with you?:::['2-11-206']
yes. i guess she hasn't seen everything yet.:::['2-11-207']
be right back. she has to go to the bathroom again.:::['2-11-208']
such a pretty face!:::['2-11-209']
oh, this is so much fun. just the girls.:::['2-11-210']
do you know what we should do? does anybody have any marijuana?:::['2-11-211']
look, no one's smoking pot around all this food.:::['2-11-213']
well, that's fine.:::['2-11-214']
i never did it. i just thought i might.:::['2-11-215']
what's new in sex?:::['2-11-216', '2-11-217']
the only man i've been with is your father.:::['2-11-218']
i'm dicing. i'm dicing. i don't hear anything.:::['2-11-219']
this is no offense to your dad, but i was thinking......there might be more.:::['2-11-220']
you know what? i cannot have this conversation with you.:::['2-11-221']
you come here and drop this bomb on me before you even tell daddy.:::['2-11-223']
do you want my blessing? want me to talk you out of it?:::['2-11-224']
then what do you want?:::['2-11-225']
i guess i figured you would understand.:::['2-11-226']
why on earth would i understand this?:::['2-11-227']
you didn't marry your barry, honey.:::['2-11-228']
but i married mine.:::['2-11-229']
we're in trouble. we've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left.:::['2-11-231']
move, move, move!:::['2-11-232']
i feel like you should have german subtitles.:::['2-11-233']
joey, speed it up!:::['2-11-234']
i'm sorry! it's the pigs! they're reluctant to get in the blanket!:::['2-11-235']
how did this happen? i thought you had this planned out.:::['2-11-236']
do you want me to cry?:::['2-11-237']
is that what you want?:::['2-11-238', '3-17-326']
do you wanna see me cry?:::['2-11-239']
sir, no, sir!:::['2-11-240']
all right, you!:::['2-11-241']
no. look, i told you, i am not a part of this thing.:::['2-11-242']
look, ross. i know you have issues with carol and susan, and i feel for you.:::['2-11-243']
but if you don't help, i'm gonna take those hot dogs......and create an appetizer called "pigs in ross.":::['2-11-244']
all right, ball a melon!:::['2-11-245']
how come i'm stuck dicing when he gets to ball a melon?:::['2-11-246']
how's it going? - great! right on schedule.:::['2-11-247']
got my happy helpers.:::['2-11-248']
that's fine. whatever.:::['2-11-249']
okay, everything. i think we're calling off the wedding.:::['2-11-252']
you're still gonna pay me, right?:::['2-11-253']
or something a little less selfish.:::['2-11-254']
what's the matter? what happened?:::['2-11-255']
my parents called to say they weren't coming.:::['2-11-256']
i knew they were having trouble with this, but......they're my parents. they're supposed to give me away.:::['2-11-257']
susan and i fought because i said maybe we should call it off.:::['2-11-258']
she said, "this isn't for them. it's for us.":::['2-11-259']
and if i couldn't see that, we should cancel the wedding.:::['2-11-260']
i, uh, can't believe i'm gonna say this, but i think susan's right.:::['2-11-262']
do you love her? and don't be too emphatic about this.:::['2-11-264']
of course i do.:::['2-11-265']
well then, that's it.:::['2-11-266']
if george and adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them.:::['2-11-267']
if my parents didn't want me to marry you......no way that would've stopped me.:::['2-11-268']
look, this is your wedding.:::['2-11-269']
do it.:::['2-11-270']
you're right. of course you're right.:::['2-11-271']
so we're back on?:::['2-11-272']
we're back on.:::['2-11-273']
you heard the woman! peel! chop! devil!:::['2-11-274']
can't believe i lost two minutes.:::['2-11-275']
it just seems so futile.:::['2-11-276']
you know? all these women, and nothing!:::['2-11-277']
i feel like superman without my powers, you know?:::['2-11-278']
i have the cape, and yet i cannot fly.:::['2-11-279']
well, now you understand how i feel every single day.:::['2-11-280']
the world is my lesbian wedding.:::['2-11-281']
butterscotch?:::['2-11-282']
no one?:::['2-11-283']
all right, you'll be sorry later.:::['2-11-284']
thank you. - anytime.:::['2-11-286']
nothing makes god happier......than when two people, any two people, come together in love.:::['2-11-288']
friends, family, we're gathered here today......to join carol and susan in holy matrimony.:::['2-11-289']
now i've seen everything!:::['2-11-291']
whoa, she's gone.:::['2-11-292']
go ahead, get married. go, go!:::['2-11-294']
<i>strangers in the night exchanging glances</i>:::['2-11-295']
<i>wondering in the night</i>:::['2-11-296']
monica: would you look at them?:::['2-11-297']
yeah. can't help but.:::['2-11-298']
how's that pig-in-the-blanket working out for you?:::['2-11-299']
i wrapped those bad boys.:::['2-11-300']
i miss rose. - oh, yeah?:::['2-11-301']
i know it's kind of weird, but she was a big part of my life...:::['2-11-302']
i don't know, i feel alone.:::['2-11-303']
you know, i, uh, couldn't help overhearing what you just said.:::['2-11-304']
i think it's time you forget about rose, move on with your life.:::['2-11-305']
how about we get you a drink?:::['2-11-306']
okay. so nice!:::['2-11-307']
i shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right?:::['2-11-308']
rachel: hey, mom, having fun?:::['2-11-309']
am i! i just danced with a wonderfully large woman.:::['2-11-310']
and three other girls made eyes at me over at the buffet.:::['2-11-311']
i'm not saying it's something i wanna pursue......but it's nice to know i have options.:::['2-11-312']
ahem, there's more alcohol, right?:::['2-11-313']
you did a good thing today.:::['2-11-316']
you wanna dance?:::['2-11-317']
no, that's fine.:::['2-11-318']
i'll let you lead.:::['2-11-320']
look, penis, schmenis!:::['2-11-322']
okay? we're all people.:::['2-11-323']
which one of us is gonna be the first one to get married?:::['2-11-324']
mon, i was married.:::['2-11-325']
yeah, me too, technically. - i had a wedding.:::['2-11-326']
just trying to start a discussion.:::['2-11-327']
which one do you think will be the last to get married?:::['2-11-328']
isn't ben in this?:::['2-11-329']
of course! - absolutely.:::['2-11-330']
phoebe: ooh, ooh, ooh.:::['2-9-0']
ugly naked guy is decorating his tree.:::['2-9-1']
oh, my god, you should see the size of his christmas balls!:::['2-9-2']
both: hey.  rachel: hey.:::['2-9-3']
how much did you tip the super?:::['2-9-4']
yeah, we were gonna give 50, but we don't wanna look bad.:::['2-9-5']
oh, this year we just made him cookies.:::['2-9-6']
and 25 it is.:::['2-9-7']
heh. you gave him cookies?:::['2-9-8']
money is so impersonal. rachel: yeah.:::['2-9-9']
cookies says someone really cares.:::['2-9-10']
all right, we're broke, but cookies do say that.:::['2-9-11']
i can see that.:::['2-9-12']
a plate of brownies told me a limerick.:::['2-9-13']
pheebs, let me ask you something. were these, uh, "funny" brownies?:::['2-9-14']
not especially.:::['2-9-15']
but, you know, i think they had pot in them.:::['2-9-16']
so, you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?:::['2-9-17']
uh, the mailman, the super...:::['2-9-18']
oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.:::['2-9-19']
joey: oh, my god.:::['2-9-20']
rachel: what?:::['2-9-21', '4-12-26', '3-8-199', '3-14-328']
uh, i don't think you're gonna like this.:::['2-9-22']
rachel: oh, wow.:::['2-9-23']
oh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section.:::['2-9-25']
and he did my crossword puzzle.:::['2-9-26']
yeah, but not very well, unless 14 across, "gershwin musical"......actually is "bite me, bite me, bite me.":::['2-9-27']
friends s02e09: the one with phoebe's dad:::['2-9-28']
i can't believe it's christmas already. you know?:::['2-9-40']
one day you're eating turkey, the next thing you know......your lords are a-leaping and your geese are a-laying. heh.:::['2-9-41']
which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.:::['2-9-42']
hey, guys. monica & chandler: hey.:::['2-9-43', '2-9-57']
i, uh, got you a little present.:::['2-9-45']
i'll open it.:::['2-9-46']
it's a slinky!:::['2-9-47']
ha, ha. remember, huh?:::['2-9-48']
walks downstairs alone or in pairs:::['2-9-49']
everyone knows it's...:::['2-9-50']
just a big spring.:::['2-9-51']
you're still mad because of the whole...:::['2-9-52']
horrible list of reasons not to be with me?:::['2-9-53']
how about we just call it "the unfortunate incident"?:::['2-9-54']
hey, gunther. you got stairs in your place?:::['2-9-55']
yeah. - go nuts.:::['2-9-56']
what's in the bag?:::['2-9-58', '5-22-258']
mm, just some presents.:::['2-9-59']

you know you want to.:::['2-9-61']
this is a picture frame from ben to my parents.:::['2-9-63']
oh, that's cute.:::['2-9-64']
some "hers" and "hers" towels for susan and carol.:::['2-9-65']
and, uh, i got this blouse for mom.:::['2-9-66']
ross, that is gorgeous! - yeah?:::['2-9-67']
monica: look at these authentic fake medals!:::['2-9-68']
mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"......at the make-believe military academy!:::['2-9-69']
happy christmas eve eve. - you too.:::['2-9-71']
oh, my god! where did you get this?:::['2-9-72']
uh, macy's, third floor, home furnishings.:::['2-9-73']
this is my father!:::['2-9-74']
this is a picture of my dad!:::['2-9-75']
uh, pheebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame.:::['2-9-76']
no, it's my dad. i'll show you.:::['2-9-77']
i thought your dad was in prison.:::['2-9-78']
no, that's my stepdad.:::['2-9-79']
my real dad's the one that ran out on us before i was born.:::['2-9-80']
how have you never been on oprah?:::['2-9-81']
look, see? this is him.:::['2-9-82']
my mother gave me this picture before she died. same guy!:::['2-9-83']
honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy......posing in front of a blue screen with a collie.:::['2-9-84']
it's not a blue screen. it's just...:::['2-9-85']
maybe it was just really clear that day.:::['2-9-86']
okay, i have to talk to my grandmother.:::['2-9-87']
monica: wait a minute, honey! ross & joey: pheebs.:::['2-9-88']
chandler: whoa. rachel: wow.:::['2-9-89']
i'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me.:::['2-9-90']
all: joey.:::['2-9-91']
oh, but when phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!:::['2-9-92']
frances: esther livingston.:::['2-9-93']
gone!:::['2-9-94']
um... hi, pooh.:::['2-9-95']
hi, gram. ahem, what you doing?:::['2-9-96']
oh, just updating the phone book.:::['2-9-97']
um, gram? um...:::['2-9-98']
can i see the pictures of my dad again?:::['2-9-99']
oh, sure, sure.:::['2-9-101']
uh... huh, how come?:::['2-9-102']
just, you know, to see him.:::['2-9-103']
oh, sure. here.:::['2-9-104']
all right, uh...:::['2-9-105']
this is the one of your father in a meadow.:::['2-9-106']
and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite.:::['2-9-107']
and here he is at a graduation.:::['2-9-108']
another graduation.:::['2-9-109', '2-9-110']
is this really my father?:::['2-9-111']
is it really your...?:::['2-9-112']
well, of course it is.:::['2-9-113']
i smell smoke. maybe because someone's pants are on fire!:::['2-9-114']
well, i...:::['2-9-115', '5-4-316']
in all the years we've been grandmother and granddaughter......you've never lied.:::['2-9-116']
all right, that's not your father. it's a picture of a guy in a frame.:::['2-9-117']
it was your mother's idea.:::['2-9-119']
she didn't want you to know your real father......because it hurt her so much when he left.:::['2-9-120']
i didn't wanna go along with it.:::['2-9-121']
but then she died and it was harder to argue with her.:::['2-9-122']
not impossible, but harder.:::['2-9-123']
all right. so he's not a famous tree surgeon?:::['2-9-124']
and i guess he doesn't live in a hut in burma where there's no phones?:::['2-9-125']
last i heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate.:::['2-9-126']
that makes no sense.:::['2-9-127']
why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?:::['2-9-128']
honey.:::['2-9-129', '2-2-247']
oh. yeah. - yeah.:::['2-9-130']
anyway, that's all i know.:::['2-9-131']
that......and this.:::['2-9-132']
this......is the real him.:::['2-9-133']
i remember my father all dressed up in the red suit......the big black boots and the patent leather belt......sneaking around downstairs. he didn't want us to see him......but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash into something and wake everybody up.:::['2-9-135']
that doesn't sound like a very merry christmas.:::['2-9-136']
who said anything about christmas?:::['2-9-137']
hi. - anyone hear from phoebe yet?:::['2-9-138']
no, nothing.:::['2-9-139', '5-21-236', '4-9-313', '4-17-284']
i hope she's okay.:::['2-9-140']
joey: i know exactly what she's going through.:::['2-9-141']
how do you know what she's going through?:::['2-9-142']
she told us.:::['2-9-143']
what do you got there, monica?:::['2-9-144']
stuff for the party.:::['2-9-145']
aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?:::['2-9-146']
you didn't buy presents yet?:::['2-9-147']
tomorrow's christmas eve! what are you gonna do?:::['2-9-148']
don't you have to be claymation to say stuff like that?:::['2-9-149']
oh, by the way, mon, i don't think the mailman liked your cookies.:::['2-9-150']
here are the ornaments your mom sent.:::['2-9-151']
monica: well...:::['2-9-152']
maybe the mailman liked the cookies. we just didn't give him enough.:::['2-9-153']
monica, pigeons learn faster than you.:::['2-9-154']
hey, rach. ahem.:::['2-9-155']
i think i know what will make you feel better.:::['2-9-156']
how about you make a list about me?:::['2-9-157']
forget it. i'm not gonna stand here......and make a list.:::['2-9-158']
okay, you're whiny......you are obsessive, you are insecure......you're gutless. - heh.:::['2-9-159']
you don't ever just seize the day.:::['2-9-160']
you liked me for a year and you didn't do anything about it.:::['2-9-161']
and, uh... oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair.:::['2-9-162']
see, there. you, uh...:::['2-9-163']
all right, you did what i said.:::['2-9-164']
and you know what? - hmm?:::['2-9-165']
you're right. i do feel better.:::['2-9-166']
thank you, ross.:::['2-9-167']
yeah, in albany. could i have the number of frank buffay?:::['2-9-168']
okay. um, in lthaca?:::['2-9-169']
all right, um, saratoga?:::['2-9-170']
oneonta?:::['2-9-171']
you know what? you shouldn't call yourself information!:::['2-9-172']
hello, grandma. if that is, in fact, your real name.:::['2-9-174']
come on now, pooh. don't still be mad at me.:::['2-9-175']
how's it going? - oh, not so good.:::['2-9-176']
upstate's pretty big. he's pretty small. you do the math.:::['2-9-177']
well, i think you're better off without him.:::['2-9-178']
oh, honey, i know he's your daddy.:::['2-9-179']
but to me, he's still the irresponsible creep......who locked up your mom and stole her gremlin.:::['2-9-180']
i know. i just wanted to know who he was, you know?:::['2-9-181']
i wasn't completely honest with you when i told you that, uh, i didn't know......exactly where he lived.:::['2-9-184']
he lives at 74 laurel drive in middletown.:::['2-9-186']
if you hit the dairy queen, you've gone too far.:::['2-9-187']

the paramedics had to cut through it.:::['2-9-216']
come on, just tell me. please, please.:::['2-9-218']

will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?:::['2-9-304']
the place is not open till tuesday.:::['2-9-306']
am i not saying it right?:::['2-9-307']
so you really did like my cookies?:::['2-9-308']
oh, yeah, they were so personal. it really showed you cared.:::['2-9-309']
nice seizing......gel boy.:::['2-9-310']
is this, uh, mistletoe?:::['2-9-312']
no, uh, that...:::['2-9-313']
that is basil.:::['2-9-314']
oh. - yeah.:::['2-9-315']
if it was mistletoe, i was gonna kiss you.:::['2-9-316']
no, it's still basil.:::['2-9-317']
how far did you get? - mailbox.:::['2-9-319']
all right, we're getting closer. - uh-huh.:::['2-9-320']
it's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.:::['2-9-322']
like yesterday, my dad was this famous burma tree-surgeon guy.:::['2-9-323']
and, you know, now he's, uh, a pharmacist guy and...:::['2-9-324']
well, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy.:::['2-9-325']
yeah, maybe. and i'll knock on the door......and he'll hug me, and i'll have a dad.:::['2-9-326']
i'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be nice to me......because, you know, i'm frank's daughter.:::['2-9-327']
so why not go knock?:::['2-9-328']
because, i mean, what if he's not this great dad guy?:::['2-9-329']
what if he's still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us?:::['2-9-330']
yeah. chandler: hmm.:::['2-9-331']
phoebe: you know what?:::['2-9-332']
i've already lost a fake dad this week.:::['2-9-333']
i don't think i'm ready to lose a real one.:::['2-9-334']
pheebs, that's okay. you took a big step today.:::['2-9-335']
yeah? chandler: yeah.:::['2-9-336']
someday, when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges.:::['2-9-337']
and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you.:::['2-9-338']
sorry about your shopping.:::['2-9-340']
chandler: oh, that's okay. we'll figure something out.:::['2-9-341']
i know you're not going in there......but do you think it'd be all right if i went in and used his bathroom?:::['2-9-342']
that's fine, never mind.:::['2-9-343']
cool, snow!:::['2-9-344']
kind of like a blank canvas.:::['2-9-345']
ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!:::['2-9-346']
you mind if i turn the heat down?:::['2-9-347']
we could have used that kind of thinking earlier!:::['2-9-348']
so, pheebs, how did it go?:::['2-9-349']
oh, ahem, i couldn't go in.:::['2-9-350']
monica: honey, i'm sorry. - are you okay?:::['2-9-351']
yeah, it's okay, because i know he's there.:::['2-9-352']
so that's enough for now.:::['2-9-353']
hey, it's after midnight! merry christmas, everyone!:::['2-9-354']
monica: oh, right! merry christmas!:::['2-9-355']
the knob was broken......so i turned it off from underneath. i hope that's all right.:::['2-9-356']
wiper blades.:::['2-9-358']
i don't even have a car.:::['2-9-359']
ha, ha. no, but with this new-car smell, you'll think you do.:::['2-9-360']

how big of a star is marcel?:::['2-13-10']
in human terms? i'd say......cybill shepherd. ross: whoa.:::['2-13-11']
rachel: really? joey: whoa.:::['2-13-12']
so you guys in the movie or you just really paranoid?:::['2-13-13']

oh, i graduated fourth grade and realized i wasn't a pimp.:::['2-13-57']
heh, heh. remember the class play?:::['2-13-58']
you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants?:::['2-13-59']
yes. back then, i, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism.:::['2-13-60']
thank god i don't do that anymore.:::['2-13-61']
oh, my god! - what? what?:::['2-13-62']
it's jean-claude van damme.:::['2-13-63']

so why don't you go talk to him? - oh. yeah.:::['2-13-71']
go tell him he's cute. what's the worst that could happen?:::['2-13-72']
he could hear me.:::['2-13-73']
i'm doing it for you. - don't you dare! don't!:::['2-13-75']
don't!:::['2-13-76']
tell him i cook!:::['2-13-77']
rachel: excuse me.:::['2-13-78']
hi. ha, ha. - hi.:::['2-13-79']
um, this is gonna sound kind of goofy. ha, ha.:::['2-13-80']
but, um, my friend over there......who cooks, by the way...:::['2-13-81']
um, she thinks you're cute. heh.:::['2-13-82']
you don't think i'm cute?:::['2-13-83']
i don't know. um...:::['2-13-84']
do you think you're cute?:::['2-13-85']
we're getting off the track. um, i was supposed to tell you......my friend thinks you're cute.:::['2-13-86']
what should i tell her?:::['2-13-87']
you can tell her i think her friend is cute.:::['2-13-88']
oh. ha, ha. - huh?:::['2-13-89']
whoa. ha, ha.:::['2-13-90']
man: makeup! - oh, that's me. i gotta go.:::['2-13-91']
um, how many times do i have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date?:::['2-13-94']
well, uh, let's try one more.:::['2-13-95']
there you go. ernie's, 8:00?:::['2-13-96']
i'll be there.:::['2-13-97', '4-22-63']
and if things go well, maybe this time......i'll get to see your underwear.:::['2-13-98']
no one was around to hear that?:::['2-13-99']
so, what'd he say? - ugh!:::['2-13-100']
what a jerk!:::['2-13-101']
i kept talking about you, and he kept asking me out.:::['2-13-102']
naturally, you know, i said no.:::['2-13-104']
thanks, anyway.:::['2-13-106']
he just kept asking......and asking, asking, asking...:::['2-13-107']
if you want to go out with him, you can.:::['2-13-108']
sounds like a jerk to me, but...:::['2-13-109']
jean-claude, she said yes! i'll see you tonight!:::['2-13-110']
then jean-claude took me to crossroads......and we hung out with drew barrymore.:::['2-13-112']
oh, man. she's so smoking!:::['2-13-113']
she's got the greatest set of...:::['2-13-114']
no guys around, huh?:::['2-13-115']
anybody need anything? - oh, i'll have an espresso.:::['2-13-116']
oh, i'll get it.:::['2-13-117', '4-8-225']
if i ask you to, you'll end up drinking it yourself.:::['2-13-118']
that is so unfair. - i know.:::['2-13-119']
like you'd drink her coffee after what you did to her with van damme?:::['2-13-120']
i have to cancel racquetball tonight.:::['2-13-121']
marcel's trainer will let me have him for a couple of hours.:::['2-13-122']
you're blowing me off for a monkey?:::['2-13-123']
we can reschedule for saturday.:::['2-13-124']
yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons.:::['2-13-125']
stick a fork in me......i am done!:::['2-13-127']
phoebe: uh...:::['2-13-128']
stick a fork what?:::['2-13-129']
like when you're cooking a steak.:::['2-13-130']
oh, i don't eat meat.:::['2-13-131']
how do you know vegetables are done?:::['2-13-132']
well, you don't. you eat them and you can tell.:::['2-13-133']
okay, then eat me, i'm done!:::['2-13-134']
i've met the perfect woman. - what?:::['2-13-136']
we're sitting on her couch, fooling around......and then she turns to me and says::::['2-13-137']
"did you ever want to do it in an elevator?":::['2-13-138']
what did you say?:::['2-13-139', '5-24-192', '5-5-138', '4-11-50']
i believe my exact words were::::['2-13-140']
how do you know if you wanna do that?:::['2-13-141']
oh, you just know.:::['2-13-142']
oh, we gotta go. got a reservation in 30 minutes.:::['2-13-143']
what i had planned shouldn't take more than two, three minutes, tops.:::['2-13-145']
two hundred seconds of passion! we gotta go.:::['2-13-146']
but, um......here's an idea.:::['2-13-147']
have you ever worn women's underwear?:::['2-13-148']
well, yes, actually......but, uh, they were my aunt edna's.:::['2-13-149']
and there were three of us in there.:::['2-13-150']
i was thinking it would be, um, kind of sexy......if you wore mine tonight at dinner.:::['2-13-151']
you want me to wear your panties?:::['2-13-152']
could you?:::['2-13-153']
if i was wearing your underwear......then, uh, what would you be wearing?:::['2-13-154']
you're swell!:::['2-13-155']
i made marcel's favorite dish, banana cake...:::['2-13-156']
ooh. ...with mealworm.:::['2-13-157']
candle. ha, ha. - ha, ha.:::['2-13-159']

oh, hi, are you on your way over...?:::['2-13-162']
no, i understand. a monkey's gotta work.:::['2-13-164']
it's no big deal.:::['2-13-165', '4-11-178', '3-11-308']
it's not like i, uh, had anything special planned, you know.:::['2-13-166']
yeah, okay. okay. okay, bye.:::['2-13-167']
okay. rachel, why don't you start talking first?:::['2-13-168']
all right. i feel that this is totally unjustified.:::['2-13-169']
she gave me the green light, i did nothing...:::['2-13-170']
do you think i can't see you in the tv set?:::['2-13-171']
monica, if there's something you'd like to share...:::['2-13-172']
you had no right to date him!:::['2-13-173']
that's the most ridiculous... - you sold me out!:::['2-13-174']
i did not! - you absolutely...:::['2-13-175']
would you let me talk!:::['2-13-176']
well, you wouldn't let me finish and i was...:::['2-13-178']

both: ow, ow, ow.:::['2-13-194']
oh! you want me to stop seeing him? - uh-huh.:::['2-13-196']
you want me to just tell him you're seeing him instead?:::['2-13-197']
is that what you want? - okay.:::['2-13-198']
oh, that's what you want?:::['2-13-199']
fine! - fine!:::['2-13-201']

i want you right here......right now.:::['2-13-215']

i was susie underpants till i was 18!:::['2-13-246']
that was in fourth grade! how could you still be upset?:::['2-13-247']
call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this.:::['2-13-249']
i hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back!:::['2-13-250']
i can't believe this. ha, ha.:::['2-13-251']
just two weeks ago, i was watching sudden death......and now i'm on a date with jean-claude van damme.:::['2-13-252']
can you beat up that guy?:::['2-13-253']
can you beat up that guy? - sure.:::['2-13-255']
oh, this is so wild.:::['2-13-256']
i gotta admit, i was surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date.:::['2-13-257']
normally, i would not do it.:::['2-13-258']
what made you make the exception for me?:::['2-13-260']
rachel told me, uh......you were dying to have a threesome with me and, uh, drew barrymore.:::['2-13-261']
by the way, drew has some ground rules and...:::['2-13-262']
say you're sorry! - no!:::['2-13-263']
monica: say it!:::['2-13-264']
no! i'm not gonna!:::['2-13-265']
say it! say it! great! - oh!:::['2-13-266']
monica: rachel.:::['2-13-267']
say you're sorry or your sweater gets it.:::['2-13-268']
that is my favorite sweater! that is my third-date sweater!:::['2-13-269']

give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.:::['2-13-274']
you don't have the guts.:::['2-13-275']
yeah? at least i wasn't too chicken to tell some guy he was cute.:::['2-13-276']
oh, all right, stop! stop the madness!:::['2-13-277']
this is crazy!:::['2-13-278']
who can remember why you're fighting in the first place?:::['2-13-279']
yes, that's right.:::['2-13-280']
but still...:::['2-13-281']
look at your purse!:::['2-13-282']

i'll help you fix your sweater.:::['2-13-285']
i'll help you......throw out your purse.:::['2-13-286']
i'm sorry i made you stop seeing him.:::['2-13-287']
i'm sorry i went out with him when i knew you liked him.:::['2-13-288']
i'm sorry that i borrowed your gloves.:::['2-13-289']
chandler: joey?:::['2-13-290']
ma?:::['2-13-291']
chandler: joey!:::['2-13-292']
what are you doing here? i thought you guys took off.:::['2-13-293']
chandler: she took off with my clothes!:::['2-13-294']
are you naked in there? - well, not exactly.:::['2-13-295']
i'm wearing panties.:::['2-13-296']
you, uh, always wear panties?:::['2-13-298']
no, no. this is the first time.:::['2-13-299']
wow. talk about your bad luck!:::['2-13-300']
i mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes.:::['2-13-301']
chandler: i was not trying them out. susie asked me to wear them.:::['2-13-302']
let me see!:::['2-13-303']
no! i'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever!:::['2-13-304']
all right, all right!:::['2-13-305']
someone's flossing!:::['2-13-307']
joey, some people don't like that.:::['2-13-308']
chandler's wearing panties.:::['2-13-309']
let me see! chandler: you don't have to see!:::['2-13-311']
hi, tushy!:::['2-13-312']
one of you give me your underpants. - oh, no.:::['2-13-313']
i'm not wearing any.:::['2-13-314']
how can you not be wearing any?:::['2-13-315']
oh. i'm getting heat from the guy in the hot-pink thong.:::['2-13-316']
look, ross. i'll give you $50 for your underpants.:::['2-13-317']
can i have the milk? - i'm almost done with it.:::['2-13-319']
keep your panties on.:::['2-13-320']
and i'm in the movie! - hey.:::['2-13-322']
what happened? - a virus victim called in sick......so cathy recommended me and boom! i'm dying on a gurney!:::['2-13-323']
hey! - oh.:::['2-13-324']
oh, marcel just finished his last scene, if you wanna go say goodbye.:::['2-13-325']
uh, that's okay. he's probably got parties to go to and stuff.:::['2-13-326']
you know, he's moved on. that's the way it goes, right?:::['2-13-327']
i think i want to write a song about all this.:::['2-13-330']
rachel: oh, yeah? phoebe: yeah.:::['2-13-331']
ooh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken.:::['2-13-332']
chandler, can i borrow your g-string?:::['2-13-333']
how long you been waiting to say that? - about 20 minutes!:::['2-13-334']
can't you see what's going on here? this man is dying!:::['2-13-335', '2-13-337', '2-13-339']
mommy! - ah.:::['2-13-340']
can't you see what's going on? this man is dead!:::['2-13-341']
announcer: can't get the monkey off your back?:::['2-12-0']
then put it in your mouth......with monkeyshine beer!:::['2-12-1']
announcer: monkeyshine beer.:::['2-12-3']
because it's a jungle out there!:::['2-12-4']
that commercial always makes me so sad.:::['2-12-5']
yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and girls run at him......so everything works out okay.:::['2-12-6']
i meant because the monkey in it reminds me of marcel.:::['2-12-7']
phoebe: i can see that.:::['2-12-8']
because they both have those big brown eyes and the little pouty chin.:::['2-12-9']
and the fact that they're both monkeys?:::['2-12-10']
i wonder if i did the right thing, giving him away.:::['2-12-11']
ross, you had to. he was humping everything in sight.:::['2-12-12']
i mean, i have a malibu barbie who will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.:::['2-12-13']
remember when he'd borrow your hat......and when you got it back, there'd be little monkey raisins in it?:::['2-12-14']
when he did it, it was funny. when i did it to my boss's hat...:::['2-12-15']
all of a sudden, i had this big "attitude problem.":::['2-12-16']
friends s02e12: the one after the superbowl (a):::['2-12-17']
check it out! guess what i got? - rhythm?:::['2-12-30']
no. my first fan mail!:::['2-12-31']
"dear dr. ramoray::::['2-12-33']
know that i love you and would do anything to have you.":::['2-12-34']
my gosh! "your not-so-secret admirer, erika ford.":::['2-12-35']
"p.s. enclosed, please find 14 of my eyelashes.":::['2-12-37']
you know, in crazy world, that means you're married.:::['2-12-38']
it's not addressed to days of our lives. this came to your apartment.:::['2-12-39']
there's no stamp on it. this woman was in our building.:::['2-12-40']
i got my very own stalker!:::['2-12-42']
hey, guys. chandler: hey.:::['2-12-43']
rachel & monica: hey. phoebe: ooh.:::['2-12-44']
where are you off to?:::['2-12-45']
there's this paleontology conference in l.a.:::['2-12-46']
so i figured i'd go and drive down to the zoo and surprise marcel.:::['2-12-47']
i think he will be surprised. till he realizes he's a monkey......and, uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion.:::['2-12-48']
oh, phoebe? that really cute guy is here again.:::['2-12-49']
oh? oh.:::['2-12-50']
okay, so everyone, ahem......pretend i'm telling you a story and it's really funny.:::['2-12-51']
so everyone just laugh. now!:::['2-12-52']
i know, i know! oh.:::['2-12-53']
hello. - hi.:::['2-12-54']
i'm rob donan.:::['2-12-56']
hi, rob donan.:::['2-12-57']
i don't know anything about music, but i think you're really great.:::['2-12-58']
oh, wow. ha, ha.:::['2-12-59']
anyway, i schedule performers for children's libraries.:::['2-12-60']
and i was thinking, have you thought about playing your songs for kids?:::['2-12-61']
oh, i would love to have kids......hear me play the songs that i will write for them.:::['2-12-62']
what do you wanna do for dinner?:::['2-12-63']
we could stay in and cook for ourselves.:::['2-12-64']
hello. erika: it's erika.:::['2-12-65']
oh, my god. the stalker!:::['2-12-66']
erika: never mind. it's open.:::['2-12-67']
yes, hitting her with a frying pan is a good idea.:::['2-12-69']
we might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon.:::['2-12-70']
let's get out of here!:::['2-12-71']
the one time they're not home!:::['2-12-72']
we'll leave. when we pass her......she won't know me, because we never met!:::['2-12-74']
that's how radio stars escape stalkers!:::['2-12-75']
she's coming!:::['2-12-76']
erika: it's me. - aah!:::['2-12-77']
uh, this is it. this is how we're gonna die.:::['2-12-78']
you ready? - wait, wait, wait!:::['2-12-79']
erika!:::['2-12-81']
lipson: mr. geller? - yes, hi.:::['2-12-82']
hi. dean lipson, zoo administrator.:::['2-12-83']
i was told you had a question.:::['2-12-84']
i, uh... i can't find the monkey i donated last year. he's a capuchin......answers to the name marcel?:::['2-12-85']
ah. i'm afraid i have some bad news.:::['2-12-86']
marcel has passed on.:::['2-12-87']
well, he got sick, and then he got sicker......and then he got a little better.:::['2-12-89']
but then he died.:::['2-12-90']
i'm sorry, mr. geller. but you know, there's an old saying::::['2-12-92']
"sometimes monkeys die.":::['2-12-93']
it's not a great saying......but it certainly is fitting today.:::['2-12-94']
someone should've called me. lipson: i'm sorry.:::['2-12-95']
look, i know this can't bring him back......but here, it's just a gesture.:::['2-12-96']
zoo dollars?:::['2-12-97']
yes, and come see the bird show at 4. the macaws wear hats.:::['2-12-98']
well, it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just died.:::['2-12-99']
children: ooh.:::['2-12-100']
i can't believe joey's having lunch with his stalker.:::['2-12-102']
what is she like?:::['2-12-103']
well, you remember kathy bates in misery? monica: mm-hm.:::['2-12-104']
well, she looks the exact opposite of that.:::['2-12-105']
and she's not crazy?:::['2-12-106']
oh, no, no. she's a total wack job.:::['2-12-107']
yeah. she thinks that joey is actually dr. drake ramoray.:::['2-12-108']
oh. and he's going out with her?:::['2-12-110']
he cannot pursue this.:::['2-12-111']
just because this woman thinks she can see joey through the magical box......in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person.:::['2-12-112']
does she not deserve happiness? does she not deserve love?:::['2-12-113']
what are you looking at me for? he's the one who wants to boff the maniac.:::['2-12-114']
no, uh-uh. i'm just nervous.:::['2-12-116']
maybe if i just picture them all in their underwear...:::['2-12-117']
that's not a good idea. that's the reason the last guy got fired.:::['2-12-118']
i'm used to playing for grownups.:::['2-12-121']
grownups drink their coffee and do their grownup thing, you know.:::['2-12-122']
and kids......listen.:::['2-12-123']
it's just a huge responsibility.:::['2-12-124']
are you gonna kiss me?:::['2-12-126']
i was thinking about it.:::['2-12-127']
yeah, okay. alrighty. let's play some tunes!:::['2-12-129']
hi, everybody. i'm phoebe.:::['2-12-130']
all: hi, phoebe!:::['2-12-131', '2-12-243']
ha, ha. okay. um......i'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, okay?:::['2-12-132']
now grandma's a person who everyone likes:::['2-12-133']
she bought you a train and a bright shiny bike:::['2-12-134']
but lately she hasn't been coming to dinner:::['2-12-135']
and last time you saw her she looked so much thinner:::['2-12-136']
now your mom and your dad said she moved to peru:::['2-12-137']
but the truth is she died and someday you will too:::['2-12-138']
la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la:::['2-12-139']
oh, drake, isn't it amazing? - yeah, it is.:::['2-12-140']
well, here we sit, devil-may-care......and just a little while ago you were reattaching simone's spinal cord.:::['2-12-142']
yeah, that was a tricky one.:::['2-12-143']
in reality......that operation takes over 10 hours, but they only showed it for two minutes.:::['2-12-144']
who's "they"?:::['2-12-145']
no one.:::['2-12-146']
oh, drake, you are so talented. let me see those hands.:::['2-12-147']
oh, these hands, these beautiful hands. - ha, ha.:::['2-12-148']
ha, ha. oh, i could just eat them.:::['2-12-149']
but i won't. joey: ha, ha.:::['2-12-150']
good. otherwise my watch would fall off.:::['2-12-151']
no, seriously.:::['2-12-152', '4-20-222']
these hands......these miracle, magical, life-giving hands.:::['2-12-153']
oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?:::['2-12-154']
all right. ha, ha. just one. - ha-ha-ha.:::['2-12-155']
you're good at that.:::['2-12-157']
man: oh, my god! someone! he's choking!:::['2-12-158']
is anyone here a doctor?:::['2-12-159']
erika: oh, yes.:::['2-12-160']
yes, the best doctor in salem!:::['2-12-161']
dr. drake ramoray!:::['2-12-162']
meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.:::['2-12-163']
uh, hey, look. i don't really enjoy being with other men that way.:::['2-12-164']
but, um, zoo dollars?:::['2-12-165']
it's about your monkey.:::['2-12-166']
it's alive.:::['2-12-167']
i don't understand. why didn't you help that man?:::['2-12-168']
uh, because, uh, i'm a neurosurgeon......and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh......"foodal chokage.":::['2-12-169']
i gotta tell you something... - no, no, no.:::['2-12-171']
you don't have to tell me anything.:::['2-12-172']
you don't have to explain yourself to me. oh!:::['2-12-173']
who am i to question the great dr. drake ramoray?:::['2-12-174']
that's... - i should be happy to be near you.:::['2-12-175']
hey, i...:::['2-12-176']
"hey" what?:::['2-12-177']
that's it. just hey!:::['2-12-178']
like at the end of a dance. hey!:::['2-12-179']
hey. ha-ha-ha.:::['2-12-180']
there'll be times when you get older:::['2-12-182']
when you'll want to sleep with people:::['2-12-183']
just to make them like you but don't:::['2-12-184']
'cause:::['2-12-185']
that's another thing that you don't wanna do:::['2-12-186', '2-12-188']
everybody!:::['2-12-187', '2-17-356', '2-24-288']
excellent! - very informative!:::['2-12-189']
not at all inappropriate!:::['2-12-190']
thank you for coming, everybody. there are cookies in the back.:::['2-12-191']
donan: that was great.:::['2-12-192']
the kids loved you.:::['2-12-193']
yay! i rock!:::['2-12-194']
and you know why? because you told the truth.:::['2-12-195']
nobody ever tells kids the truth.:::['2-12-196']
you were incredible!:::['2-12-197']
ha, ha. but?:::['2-12-198']
how did you know there was a "but"? - i sense these things.:::['2-12-199']
it was either "but" or "butter.":::['2-12-200']
the thing is, i think some of the parents......they were hoping that......you'd play more songs about barnyard animals.:::['2-12-201']
i can do that.:::['2-12-202', '2-17-310']
because that would be fantastic. - oh.:::['2-12-204']
what? you wanna kiss me?:::['2-12-205']
i'm thinking about it.:::['2-12-206']
janitor: ah, the bat.:::['2-12-207']
ambassador of darkness.:::['2-12-208']
flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger.:::['2-12-209']
sightless specter of the macabre.:::['2-12-210']
buddy, my monkey?:::['2-12-211']
oh, yeah, right.:::['2-12-212']
there was a break-in......a few months back. inside job.:::['2-12-213']
your monkey was taken.:::['2-12-214']
oh, my god. the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.:::['2-12-215']
pfft. the zoo!:::['2-12-216']
you believe everything the zoo tells you?:::['2-12-217']
uh, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me.:::['2-12-218']
of course they'll say he's dead. they don't want the bad publicity.:::['2-12-219']
it's all a great big cover-up.:::['2-12-220']
do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?:::['2-12-221']
that guy lipson?:::['2-12-222']
lipson knows?:::['2-12-223']
lipson knows, huh?:::['2-12-225']
ah, hello, mr. possum.:::['2-12-226']
enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night.:::['2-12-227']
taunting gravity... - buddy, my monkey. my monkey?:::['2-12-228']
word on the street...:::['2-12-229']
well, when i say "street," i mean those little pretend streets here at the zoo.:::['2-12-230']
your monkey found a new career......in the entertainment field. that's all i know.:::['2-12-232']
this is unbelievable!:::['2-12-233']
so, what is this information worth to you, my friend?:::['2-12-234']
are you trying to get me to bribe you?:::['2-12-235']
but you already told me everything.:::['2-12-237']
check it out. he actually is the monkeyshine monkey.:::['2-12-238']
rachel: oh, wow. so, what are you gonna do?:::['2-12-239']
i'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is.:::['2-12-240']
that's what i did when i lost my clydesdales.:::['2-12-241']
okay, hi again!:::['2-12-242']
today, we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.:::['2-12-244']
oh, the cow in the meadow goes "moo":::['2-12-245', '2-12-246']
then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up:::['2-12-247']
and that's how we get hamburgers:::['2-12-248']
now chickens:::['2-12-249']
you're the only one who can save her, drake!:::['2-12-250']
damn it! i'm a doctor, i'm not god!:::['2-12-251']
well, there goes my whole belief system.:::['2-12-252']
erika: it's erika.:::['2-12-253']
quick! quick. shut off the tv.:::['2-12-254']
wait, i wanna see what happens!:::['2-12-255']
uh, i get leslie out of the coma then we make out.:::['2-12-256']
how can that be? you were just kissing sabrina.:::['2-12-257']
rachel, it's a world where joey is a neurosurgeon.:::['2-12-258']
hey, erika. come in.:::['2-12-259']
how did you get here so fast? i just saw you in salem.:::['2-12-260']
right, they, uh, choppered me in. ha, ha.:::['2-12-261']
erika: oh, you're having a little party too.:::['2-12-263']
is she here, huh, huh? - who?:::['2-12-264']
sabrina. i know about you two!:::['2-12-265']
i saw you today, kissing in the doctor's lounge.:::['2-12-266']
it's not what you think. that was...:::['2-12-267']

the library board has had a lot of complaints from parents......about some of the stuff in your songs. - i can't believe it!:::['2-12-306']
did you tell your board about how the kids want to hear the truth?:::['2-12-307']
maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs?:::['2-12-310']
what do you want me to be? like some......stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?:::['2-12-312']
you don't have to be barney.:::['2-12-313']
who's barney? - eh...:::['2-12-314']
well, i tracked down marcel and get this: he's healthy, he's happy......and he's here in new york filming outbreak 2: the virus takes manhattan.:::['2-12-315']
both: you're kidding!:::['2-12-316']
this is amazing. - i know.:::['2-12-317']
i finally get a part on tv, and the monkey's making movies.:::['2-12-318']
okay. rachel, i'm ready.:::['2-12-319']

um, yeah, i guess that's me.:::['2-12-322']
she's here!:::['2-12-323']
sometimes men love women:::['2-12-324']
and sometimes men love men:::['2-12-325']
and then there are bisexuals:::['2-12-326']
though some just say they're kidding themselves:::['2-12-327']
la-la-la-la. la-la-la-la-la-la-la.:::['2-12-328']
la-la-la-la. la-la-la-la-la, la-la:::['2-12-329']
this is exciting. i haven't seen my monkey in a year.:::['2-12-330']
what, you never look down in the shower?:::['2-12-331']
oh, please. i'm not allowed to make one joke in the "monkey is penis" genre?:::['2-12-332']
security guard: back up, please.:::['2-12-333']
back up. come on, come on.:::['2-12-334']
excuse me. uh, where can we find the monkey?:::['2-12-335']
i'm sorry. it's a closed set.:::['2-12-336']
i'm sorry, you don't understand. i'm a friend of his.:::['2-12-337']
we, uh, used to live together.:::['2-12-338']
yeah. and i have a timeshare in the poconos with flipper.:::['2-12-339']
monica: ross, there he is!:::['2-12-340']
hey! hey, buddy!:::['2-12-341']
marcel! marcel!:::['2-12-342']
in the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight:::['2-12-343', '2-12-344']
they won't take you to the vet:::['2-12-345']
you're obviously not their favorite pet:::['2-12-346', '2-17-224', '2-17-361']
smelly cat, smelly cat - smelly cat, smelly cat:::['2-12-347']
it's not your fault - it's not your fault:::['2-12-348']
no:::['2-12-349']
what? - i'm sorry.:::['2-12-350', '2-16-183', '2-15-135']
what's wrong with that?:::['2-12-351', '2-14-255']
um, ahem, i think you might wanna, like, pick a more masculine note. heh.:::['2-12-352']
man, this is weird.:::['2-16-0']
ever realize cap'n crunch's eyebrows are on his hat?:::['2-16-1']
that's what's weird?:::['2-16-2']
the man's been captain of a cereal for 40 years.:::['2-16-3']
whoa, yuck!:::['2-16-4']
the spoon! you licked and you put.:::['2-16-6']
you licked and you put.:::['2-16-7']
yeah, so?:::['2-16-8', '5-4-58', '5-4-205', '3-6-115']
don't you see how gross that is? it's like you using my toothbrush!:::['2-16-9']
you used my toothbrush?:::['2-16-10']
only because i used the red one to unclog the drain.:::['2-16-11']
mine is the red one!:::['2-16-12']
oh, god! can open. worms everywhere!:::['2-16-13']
why can't we use the same toothbrush......but we can use the same soap?:::['2-16-14']
because soap is soap. it's self-cleaning.:::['2-16-15']
the next time you shower......think about the last thing i wash and the first thing you wash.:::['2-16-16']
friends s02e16: the one where joey moves out:::['2-16-17']
look at you fancy lads!:::['2-16-30']
what's the occasion?:::['2-16-31']
you know that guy on my show that's in a coma?:::['2-16-32']
he's having a brunch.:::['2-16-33']
ready when you are.:::['2-16-34']
i can't believe you're actually getting tattoos.:::['2-16-35']
you guys are getting tattoos?:::['2-16-36']
but you cannot tell ross because i wanna surprise him.:::['2-16-37']
wow, this is wild! what are you gonna get?:::['2-16-38']
i'm getting a lily.:::['2-16-39']
for my mom, because her name's lily.:::['2-16-40']
that's lucky. what if her name was big ugly splotch?:::['2-16-41']
where you getting it? - on my shoulder.:::['2-16-42']
ross: what's on your shoulder?:::['2-16-44']
a chip.:::['2-16-45']
a tattoo. i'm getting a tattoo. ross: a tattoo?:::['2-16-46']
why? why would you wanna do that?:::['2-16-47']
you don't think they're kind of cool?:::['2-16-49']
no. sorry, i don't.:::['2-16-50']
why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life?:::['2-16-51']
what if it doesn't come out right?:::['2-16-52']
it's like having a bad haircut all the time.:::['2-16-53']
why is everyone staring at me?:::['2-16-54']
sign this card for dad. richard will be here soon.:::['2-16-55']
richard's going to the party too?:::['2-16-56']
he's my parents' best friend. he has to go.:::['2-16-57']
so is today the day you'll tell them about you two?:::['2-16-58']
yeah, for my dad's birthday, i decided to give him a stroke.:::['2-16-59']
no, i think you should tell them.:::['2-16-60']
i don't know how serious he is. until i do, i won't say anything.:::['2-16-61']
i don't think mom and dad would mind.:::['2-16-62']
remember when you were 9 and richard was 30, dad said::::['2-16-63']
"god, i hope they get together.":::['2-16-64']
ross: shall we?:::['2-16-65']
okay, wait.:::['2-16-66']
ross, let's switch places. you get in the middle.:::['2-16-68']
this looks like we're trying to cover something up.:::['2-16-69']
you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.:::['2-16-70']
ross: we're here!:::['2-16-71']
mrs. geller: hi, kids! mr. geller: the children!:::['2-16-72']
happy birthday, dad. - thank you.:::['2-16-73']
so you kids thanked dr. burke for the ride?:::['2-16-75']
actually, mom, i think monica thanked him for the both of us.:::['2-16-76']
so you kids take the train in?:::['2-16-77']
no, richard burke gave them a ride.:::['2-16-78']
speaking of whom......i hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city.:::['2-16-79']
finger cramp! oh, god!:::['2-16-80']
sorry. here, let me get that, mom.:::['2-16-81']
so richard's shopping in the junior section?:::['2-16-82']
are we still on that?:::['2-16-83']
you just know she's got the iq of a napkin.:::['2-16-84']
she's probably not even pretty.:::['2-16-85']
just young enough so that everything is still pointing up.:::['2-16-86']
joey: can you believe this place?:::['2-16-87']
i know. this is a great apartment.:::['2-16-88']
in the bathroom there's mirrors on both sides of you.:::['2-16-89']
when you're in there, it's like peeing with the rockettes.:::['2-16-90']
well, there's my fantasy come true.:::['2-16-91']
seriously.:::['2-16-92', '2-4-260', '3-25-4', '3-3-31']
we were just saying, great apartment!:::['2-16-94']
thanks. you want it?:::['2-16-95']
i'm moving to a bigger place.:::['2-16-96']
you should take this one.:::['2-16-97']
can you see me in a place like this?:::['2-16-98']
why not? you hate park views and high ceilings?:::['2-16-99']
come on, i'll show you the kitchen.:::['2-16-100']
that's all right, i saw a kitchen this morning.:::['2-16-101']
on tv.:::['2-16-102']
stop talking. okay!:::['2-16-103']
come on, tell us! - is she really 20?:::['2-16-104']
i am not telling you guys anything.:::['2-16-105']
come on, it's my birthday. let me live vicariously!:::['2-16-106']
dad, you really don't want to do that.:::['2-16-107']
what's a little midlife crisis between friends?:::['2-16-108']
would you let it go?:::['2-16-109']
i know what you're going through. when i turned 50, i got the porsche.:::['2-16-110']
you got your own little speedster.:::['2-16-111']
seriously, it's not like that. mr. geller: tell you what.:::['2-16-112']
maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and i could...:::['2-16-113']
dad, i beg you not to finish that sentence!:::['2-16-114']
what? i'm kidding!:::['2-16-115']
you know i'd never let him touch the porsche.:::['2-16-116']
which lily? this lily or that lily?:::['2-16-118']
well, i... - i like this lily.:::['2-16-119']
it's more open and that's like my mom.:::['2-16-120']
she had a more open, giving spirit.:::['2-16-121']
foghorn leghorn!:::['2-16-122']
blond girl? you're in room two.:::['2-16-123']
not-so-blond girl, you're with me.:::['2-16-124']
here we go! - uh-huh.:::['2-16-125']
you're not going.:::['2-16-126']
is this because of what ross said?:::['2-16-128']
well, yeah, maybe. - i don't believe this.:::['2-16-130']
is this how this relationship works? ross equals boss?:::['2-16-131']
come on, what is this, 1922?:::['2-16-132']
what's 1922?:::['2-16-133']
just, you know, a long time ago.:::['2-16-134']
when men used to tell women what to do a lot.:::['2-16-135']
then there was suffrage, which was a good thing. but it sounds horrible.:::['2-16-136']
do you want this tattoo?:::['2-16-137']
yes, i do. it's just that ross...:::['2-16-138']
is your boyfriend the boss of you?:::['2-16-139']
who is the boss of you?:::['2-16-141']
you?:::['2-16-142', '4-24-190', '3-9-109']
no. you are the boss of you!:::['2-16-143']
you march in there and get that tattoo on your hip!:::['2-16-144']
i'm a twinkie!:::['2-16-147']
really? i'm a hero.:::['2-16-148']
yeah, i know. i hate it too.:::['2-16-150']
look, maybe we should just tell them.:::['2-16-151']
maybe we should just tell your parents first.:::['2-16-152']
my parents are dead.:::['2-16-153']
god, you are so lucky!:::['2-16-154']
i mean... well, you know what i mean.:::['2-16-155']
just hang in there, okay?:::['2-16-156']
okay, i'll go out first, all right?:::['2-16-157']
judy! going to the bathroom. good for you!:::['2-16-158']
thank you, richard. i appreciate the support.:::['2-16-159']
mr. geller: honey.:::['2-16-160']
seen my harmon killebrew bat? bob doesn't believe i have one.:::['2-16-161']
did you know richard has a twinkie in the city?:::['2-16-163']
i know. he's a new man. it's like a scene from cocoon.:::['2-16-164']
i just never would have pictured richard with a bimbo.:::['2-16-165']
he told johnny shapiro that she's quite a girl.:::['2-16-166']
he told johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her.:::['2-16-167']
mrs. geller: really? - i've never seen him this happy.:::['2-16-168']
so, jack......ever think about trading me in for a younger model?:::['2-16-169']
with you, it's like i've got two 25-year-olds.:::['2-16-171']
oh, jack, stop!:::['2-16-172']
mr. geller: come on!:::['2-16-173']
it's my birthday!:::['2-16-174']
can we drop this?:::['2-16-175']
i am not interested in the guy's apartment.:::['2-16-176']
oh, please. i saw the way you were checking out his moldings.:::['2-16-177']
you want it.:::['2-16-178']
why would i want another apartment?:::['2-16-179']
i've already got an apartment that i love.:::['2-16-180']
it wouldn't kill you to say it once in a while.:::['2-16-181']
all right. you want the truth? i'm thinking about it.:::['2-16-182']
i'm 28. i've never lived alone......and i'm at a place where i got enough money......that i don't need a roommate.:::['2-16-184']
whoa, whoa, whoa. i don't need a roommate either.:::['2-16-185']
i can afford to live here by myself.:::['2-16-186']
i may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware.:::['2-16-187']
why are you getting so bent out of shape?:::['2-16-188']
we didn't agree to live together forever.:::['2-16-189']
we're not bert and ernie.:::['2-16-190']
if this is the way you feel......then maybe you should take it.:::['2-16-192']
that's how i feel. - then maybe you should take it!:::['2-16-193']
maybe i will!:::['2-16-194']
fine with me! - great!:::['2-16-195']
you can spend more quality time with your real friends......the spoons!:::['2-16-196']
whose drink can i freshen?:::['2-16-197']
almost time for cake!:::['2-16-198']
mon, are you okay?:::['2-16-200']
remember that video of mom and dad? - yeah?:::['2-16-201']
well, i just caught the live show. - ew!:::['2-16-202']
hey there. - what?:::['2-16-203']
nothing. i just heard something nice about you.:::['2-16-204']
mrs. geller: richard?:::['2-16-206']
your son isn't seeing anyone, is he? - not that i know of.:::['2-16-207']
i was thinking, why doesn't he give monica a call?:::['2-16-208']
that's an idea.:::['2-16-209']
well, actually, i'm already seeing someone.:::['2-16-210']
oh? - oh?:::['2-16-211']
ross: oh...:::['2-16-212']
she never tells us anything.:::['2-16-213']
ross, did you know monica's seeing someone?:::['2-16-214']
mom, there are so many people in my life.:::['2-16-215']
some are seeing people and some aren't.:::['2-16-216']
is that crystal?:::['2-16-217']
so who's the mystery man?:::['2-16-218']
well, he's a doctor.:::['2-16-219']
a real doctor?:::['2-16-220']
no, a doctor of meat.:::['2-16-221']
of course he's a real doctor.:::['2-16-222']
and he's handsome.:::['2-16-223']
and he's sweet, and i know you'd like him.:::['2-16-224']
well, that's wonderful.:::['2-16-225']
mom, it's okay.:::['2-16-226']
it is, judy.:::['2-16-227']
could you come in here for a moment?:::['2-16-229']
now!:::['2-16-230']
found it! - i'll take that, dad.:::['2-16-231']
it seems your daughter and richard are something of an item.:::['2-16-232']
that's impossible. he's got a twinkie in the city.:::['2-16-233']
i'm the twinkie.:::['2-16-234']
you're the twinkie? - she's not a twinkie!:::['2-16-235']
look, this is the best relationship i've been in...:::['2-16-236']
oh, please! a relationship?:::['2-16-237']
yes, a relationship!:::['2-16-238']
for your information, i'm crazy about this man.:::['2-16-239']
am i supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?:::['2-16-242']
this is a good thing. you said you've never seen richard happier.:::['2-16-243']
when did i say that?:::['2-16-244']
upstairs in the bathroom, right before you felt up mom!:::['2-16-245']
singing: happy birthday to you:::['2-16-246']
happy birthday, dear jack:::['2-16-248']
it looks so good! oh, i love it.:::['2-16-250']
i know, so do i! i'm so glad you made me do this.:::['2-16-251']
okay, let me see yours.:::['2-16-252']
let's see yours again.:::['2-16-253']
we just saw mine. let me see yours.:::['2-16-254']
it's gone! that's so weird.:::['2-16-256']
i don't know how, where it went.:::['2-16-257']
i'm sorry! i'm sorry!:::['2-16-261']
how could you do this to me? this was your idea!:::['2-16-262']
i know! i was gonna get it, but he came in with this needle.:::['2-16-263']
and did you know they do this with needles?:::['2-16-264']
really? you don't say?:::['2-16-265']
because mine was licked on by kittens!:::['2-16-266']
i'm sorry about what...:::['2-16-268']
yeah, me too. - i know.:::['2-16-269']
do we need to hug?:::['2-16-270']
no, we're all right.:::['2-16-271']
so i got you something.:::['2-16-272']
plastic spoons!:::['2-16-273']
great! - lick away, my man!:::['2-16-274']
these will go great in my new place till i get real ones.:::['2-16-275']
i can't use these forever. they're no friend of the environment.:::['2-16-277']
no, i mean what's this about your new place?:::['2-16-278']
i'm moving out, like we talked about.:::['2-16-279']
i didn't think that was serious.:::['2-16-280']
you know, i thought that was just a fight.:::['2-16-281']
well, it was a fight......based on serious stuff, remember?:::['2-16-282']
about how i never lived alone or anything?:::['2-16-283']
i think it would be good for me. help me to grow......or whatever.:::['2-16-284']
hey, are you cool with this?:::['2-16-286']
i don't wanna leave you high and dry.:::['2-16-287']

put the foosball table in there.:::['2-16-290']
why do you get to keep the table?:::['2-16-291']

run, yasmine. run like the wind.:::['2-17-109']
but you wanted to live by yourself.:::['2-17-110']
i did. i thought it'd be great.:::['2-17-111']
i figured i'd have time alone with my thoughts.:::['2-17-112']
but it turns out i don't have as many thoughts as you'd think.:::['2-17-113']
joey, why don't you talk to chandler about moving back?:::['2-17-114']
you really think he'd take me?:::['2-17-115']
we had a good talk last night......but when i moved out, i hurt him bad.:::['2-17-116']
i promise you, he would definitely want you back.:::['2-17-117']
i'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back.:::['2-17-118']
but we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. heh.:::['2-17-119']
i mean, it was...:::['2-17-120']
it was like when we first started living together.:::['2-17-121']
look, i know you don't want to hear this right now......but we've seen him in his new place. and he's happy.:::['2-17-122']
he's decorated.:::['2-17-123']
look, chandler, he has moved on, okay? you have to, too.:::['2-17-124']
no, you're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now.:::['2-17-125']
you're not......roommates anymore.:::['2-17-126']
okay, phoebe. ready to try one?:::['2-17-127']

maybe if we could talk about this......because i need to feel that you really care about the cat.:::['2-17-147']

it's just that it's costing about $100 a minute to be in here.:::['2-17-149']
oh, okay. so, um, the cat stinks, but you love it. let's go.:::['2-17-150']

i loved you in a you're-my-brother- so-i-have-to way......but basically, i hated your guts.:::['2-17-299']
why did you hate me?:::['2-17-300']
because you were mean to me......and you teased me and you always got your way.:::['2-17-301']

listen, you are not going to believe this......but, ahem, that is not me singing on the video.:::['2-17-319']
well, how did you find out?:::['2-17-322']
the record company sent this paper for me to sign saying it's okay......for someone else to sing for me. that was my first clue.:::['2-17-323']
i can't work with people who would do this.:::['2-17-325']
i mean, this poor woman.:::['2-17-327']
what woman?:::['2-17-328']
the voice woman.:::['2-17-329']

okay, pheebs, but what about you?:::['2-17-331']
i have a video. pay attention.:::['2-17-332']
no, this voice woman, she's so talented.:::['2-17-333']
but according to the producer people......they said, like, she doesn't have the right look or something. you know?:::['2-17-334']
she's like one of those animals at the pound......who nobody wants because they're not pretty.:::['2-17-335']
or, you know, like some old dog who's kind of like stinky and...:::['2-17-336']
oh, my god! she's smelly cat!:::['2-17-337']
oh, oh, that song has so many levels.:::['2-17-338']

well, that's the brilliance of it.:::['2-17-349']
the pretty people.:::['2-17-350']

oh, obviously you know barbara and i split up......or you wouldn't do the head tilt.:::['2-15-76']
the head tilt?:::['2-15-77']
since the divorce, everybody asks how i am......with a sympathetic head tilt. "how you doing? you okay?":::['2-15-78']
i'm sorry. - no, no.:::['2-15-80']
it's fine. believe me, i do it too.:::['2-15-81']

"you're sure?" "yeah, i'm fine.":::['2-15-83']
i gotta set up the music. i got a new cd changer.:::['2-15-84']
of course, the divorce only left me with four cds to change.:::['2-15-85']
oh, that's too bad.:::['2-15-86']
i'll survive.:::['2-15-87']
announcer: ward. with a reverse.:::['2-15-88']

you are so smitten. - i am not!:::['2-15-112']
oh, you are so much the smitten kitten.:::['2-15-113']
you should ask him out. - dr. burke?:::['2-15-115']
i don't think so. i mean, like, he's a grown-up.:::['2-15-116']
so? you two are totally into each other.:::['2-15-117']
he's a friend of my parents. he's like 20 years older than me.:::['2-15-118']
so you're never gonna see him again?:::['2-15-119']
not never.:::['2-15-120']
i'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment.:::['2-15-121']
didn't you just get your eyes checked? - yeah, but, you know, uh......27 is a dangerous eye age.:::['2-15-122']
i'm not saying it was a bad movie. i'm just saying it was a little......hard to follow.:::['2-15-123']
i told you there'd be subtitles.:::['2-15-124']
rachel: i know.:::['2-15-125']
i just didn't want to wear my glasses on our first date.:::['2-15-126']
it would help when i'm kissing if you didn't shout my sister's name.:::['2-15-129']
honey, i'm just checking. - oh.:::['2-15-130']
ahem. monica? - mon?:::['2-15-131']
monica? ross: mon?:::['2-15-132']
i'm sorry. it's just, when you moved your hands down to my butt......it was like, "whoa, ross' hands are on my butt!":::['2-15-136']
and that's funny why?:::['2-15-138']
well, it's not. uh...:::['2-15-139']
i mean, i'm sorry. i guess i'm just nervous.:::['2-15-140']
i mean, it's you.:::['2-15-141']
you know, it's us. - mm.:::['2-15-142']
i mean, we're crossing that line. it's sort of a big thing.:::['2-15-143']
well, i know it's big. i just didn't know it was ha-ha big.:::['2-15-144']
okay, my hands were nowhere near your butt.:::['2-15-146']
i know, i know, i know!:::['2-15-147']
i was thinking about when they were there the last time.:::['2-15-148']
i'm sorry, i'm sorry. okay, look! whoa, i promise.:::['2-15-149']
i'm good. i won't laugh anymore. put your hands back there.:::['2-15-150']
no, see, now i can't, because, uh......i'm feeling too self-conscious.:::['2-15-151']
just one cheek. - no. ha.:::['2-15-152']
the moment's gone.:::['2-15-153']
i'll back up into your hands. - that's romantic.:::['2-15-154']
rachel: touch it. ross: no.:::['2-15-155']
rachel: oh, come on, squeeze it. ross: no!:::['2-15-156']
rachel: rub it? ross: no.:::['2-15-157']
rachel: oh, come on! would you just grab my ass?:::['2-15-158']
wow, look at that. the car is on fire......yet somehow its expensive paint job......is protected by the miracle wax.:::['2-15-159']

that was 14 hours ago.:::['2-15-165']
so how'd it go? - well...:::['2-15-166']
have you ever been, you know, fooling around with a girl......and, uh, she started laughing?:::['2-15-167']
yeah, but, uh, it was 1982......and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin.:::['2-15-168']
she laughed at you? - yeah.:::['2-15-169']
i've been wanting this since ninth grade typing.:::['2-15-170']
you know, i just want it to be perfect......and right and...:::['2-15-171']

if you hated the bracelet, you should have just said so.:::['2-14-193']
doesn't the fact that i wore it......say how much our friendship means to me?:::['2-14-194']
what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?:::['2-14-195']
well, that's the part where i'm a wank.:::['2-14-196']
i was hoping you wouldn't focus on that.:::['2-14-197']
come on, man! i said i was sorry a hundred times.:::['2-14-198']

well, you owe me one, big guy.:::['2-1-103']
here's your lemonade.:::['2-1-104']
i didn't order lemonade.:::['2-1-105']
oh. well then you better go take that back. they're gonna charge you for that.:::['2-1-106']
but... - go, go, go! come on, come on!:::['2-1-107']
okay, so, uh, what did you find out?:::['2-1-108']
he said...:::['2-1-109']
he said they're having a great time. - i'm sorry. - what?:::['2-1-110']
but the silver lining, if you wanna see it......is that he made this decision all by himself......without any outside help whatsoever.:::['2-1-111']
how is that a silver lining?:::['2-1-112']
you have to really wanna see it.:::['2-1-113']
ironically, these guys were picked last in gym.:::['2-1-114']
hey, pheebs.:::['2-1-115', '5-19-185', '5-4-256', '5-11-237']
you know what i'm thinking? - oh, okay.:::['2-1-116']
how......it's been so long since you've had sex......you're wondering if they've changed it?:::['2-1-117']
no. although now that's what i'm thinking.:::['2-1-118']
so, what were you thinking?:::['2-1-119', '3-3-204']
i was thinking you gave the guys great haircuts. i thought you'd like to do mine.:::['2-1-120']
oh! no.:::['2-1-121']
why not? - because i'm just...:::['2-1-122']
i'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.:::['2-1-123']
no, you're not. i know i'm not, but you are.:::['2-1-124']
i was trying to spare your feelings.:::['2-1-125']

ross: hi, sweetie. i'm sorry. we got disconnected.:::['2-1-152']
okay, okay, okay. how did this happen to me? how?:::['2-1-154']
a week ago, two weeks ago, i was fine.:::['2-1-155']
ross was just ross. just this guy.:::['2-1-156']
now all of a sudden, he's ross......ugh, this really great guy that i can't have.:::['2-1-157']
sweetie, i wanted you to have him too.:::['2-1-158']
i know you did.:::['2-1-159']
ugh. i'm just gonna deal with it. i'm just gonna deal with it:::['2-1-160']
i gotta get out of here!:::['2-1-161']
i don't care what you guys say. something's bothering her.:::['2-1-162']
you know, i think i was 16.:::['2-1-163']
please, just a little bit off the back.:::['2-1-164']
um, i'm still on "no.":::['2-1-165']
uh, morning. - hey.:::['2-1-166']
could you close your eyes for a sec?:::['2-1-167']
oh, no, no, no. i'm not falling for that again.:::['2-1-168']
what's going on? - i sort of did a stupid thing last night.:::['2-1-169']
what stupid thing did you do?:::['2-1-170']
rachel: why don't you just go get dressed... ...then you'll be on your way. bye-bye.:::['2-1-171']
rachel, how did this happen?:::['2-1-172']
i don't know, i kind of ran into him last night.:::['2-1-173']
where? - at his apartment. is this juice?:::['2-1-174']
whoa. and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe?:::['2-1-175']
oh, god, i know. i'm pathetic, i'm a loser.:::['2-1-176']
honey, you're not pathetic. you're just sad.:::['2-1-177']
yeah. people do stupid things when they're upset.:::['2-1-178']
my god, if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i hadn't...:::['2-1-179']
but this is about your horrible mistake.:::['2-1-180']
hi. all: hey!:::['2-1-181']
hi... ross: sorry we're late.:::['2-1-182']
we were, uh...:::['2-1-183']
well, there was touching.:::['2-1-184']
hey, ross! - paolo. ha.:::['2-1-185']
what a...:::['2-1-186']
what, uh...? what are you doing here?:::['2-1-187']
i do raquel. - ah.:::['2-1-188']
so, uh, he's back?:::['2-1-189']
yeah, he's back. is that a problem?:::['2-1-190']
no, not a problem.:::['2-1-191']
good. glad it's not a problem.:::['2-1-192']
okay, you're gonna have to not touch my ass.:::['2-1-193']
well, despite the yummy bagels and palpable tension......i've got pants that need to be altered.:::['2-1-194']
oh, when you see frankie, tell him joey tribbiani says hello.:::['2-1-195']
he'll know what it means.:::['2-1-196']
you sure he's gonna be able to crack that code?:::['2-1-197']
it's funny. the last time paolo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter.:::['2-1-198']
but... but! you have to promise that you will not be all controlly and bossy......and all, you know, monica about it.:::['2-1-200']
i promise. all right, let's see.:::['2-1-201']
now, some of you are gonna get cut and some of you aren't.:::['2-1-202']
but i promise, none of you will feel a thing.:::['2-1-203']
all right, that's it. i quit. - what? i didn't say anything!:::['2-1-205']
yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.:::['2-1-206']
this is the face of a person who, you know......doesn't trust a person.:::['2-1-207']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry, phoebe.:::['2-1-208']
it's just a little shorter than what we had discussed.:::['2-1-209']
would you relax? i know what i am doing.:::['2-1-210']
this is how he wears it.:::['2-1-211']
how who wears it? - demi moore.:::['2-1-212']
heh. demi moore is not a he.:::['2-1-213']
well, he was a he in arthur and in 10.:::['2-1-214']
that's dudley moore!:::['2-1-215']
i said i wanted it like demi moore!:::['2-1-216']
oh. oh! - oh, my god!:::['2-1-217']
oh, god! - oh, my god!:::['2-1-218']
oh, my god! i'm sorry! i'm sorry! i'm sorry!:::['2-1-219']
which one is demi moore?:::['2-1-220']
she's the actress that was in disclosure, indecent proposal, ghost!:::['2-1-221']
oh, she's got gorgeous hair. - i know!:::['2-1-222']
how long do you want the cuffs? at least as long as i have the pants.:::['2-1-224']
i just got that.:::['2-1-225']
okay. now we'll do your inseam.:::['2-1-226']
how is she? it's too soon to tell.:::['2-1-227']
she's resting, which is a good sign.:::['2-1-228']
how's the hair? - i'm not gonna lie to you, ross.:::['2-1-229']
it doesn't look good.:::['2-1-230']
i put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.:::['2-1-231']
can we see her?:::['2-1-232']
your hair looks too good. it would upset her.:::['2-1-233']
ross, why don't you come on in.:::['2-1-234']
well, how you doing? - i'm okay.:::['2-1-235']
ooh, that bad, huh? - what?:::['2-1-236']
look, i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable.:::['2-1-237']
it's one of my gifts. sit.:::['2-1-238']
ugh, joey, when i saw him get off that plane with her......i really thought i just hit rock bottom.:::['2-1-239']
but today, it's like there's rock bottom......50 feet of crap......then me.:::['2-1-240']
you gotta tell ross how you feel.:::['2-1-241']
oh, come on, how can i just tell him? what about julie?:::['2-1-242']
what about her? they've only been going out for two weeks.:::['2-1-243']
ross has been in love with you for 10 years.:::['2-1-244']
i don't know. i don't know. - look, rach, rach.:::['2-1-245']
i've been with my share of women.:::['2-1-246']
i've been with a lot of people's share of women.:::['2-1-247']
but the point is......i've never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you.:::['2-1-248']
yo, paisan.:::['2-1-250']
can i talk to you for a sec?:::['2-1-251']
your tailor......is a very bad man!:::['2-1-252']
frankie? what are you talking about?:::['2-1-253']
joey's tailor......took advantage of me.:::['2-1-255']
what? - no way.:::['2-1-256']
i've been going to the guy for 12 years.:::['2-1-257']
oh, come on. he said he was gonna do my inseam.:::['2-1-258']
then he ran his hand up my leg and then there was definite...:::['2-1-259']
first they go up one side, they move it over.:::['2-1-263']
then they go up the other side, move it back, then they do the rear.:::['2-1-264']
what? ross, tell him. isn't that how a tailor measures pants?:::['2-1-265']
yes, yes, it is. in prison!:::['2-1-266']
that's not?:::['2-1-269']
even mary tyler moore would've been better.:::['2-1-271']
yeah, i do. i think it's a 10!:::['2-1-273']
my hair is very amused.:::['2-1-275']
oh, come on, things could be worse. i mean, uh...:::['2-1-276']
you could "get caught between the moon and new york city.:::['2-1-277']
i know it's crazy, but it's true.":::['2-1-278']
well, i gotta go. bye. - see you.:::['2-1-280']
bye, rach! rachel: wait, are you leaving?:::['2-1-281']
that's what i meant by "bye.":::['2-1-282']
well, uh, can i talk to you for a sec? okay.:::['2-1-283']
when the doctor does that hernia test...:::['2-1-284']
what's going on? - um...:::['2-1-286']
well, um, okay, first of all... - mm-hm.:::['2-1-287']
...paolo and i are not back together.:::['2-1-288']
that was a stupid thing i did.:::['2-1-289']
if i could go back in time and do it again......well, i wouldn't.:::['2-1-290']
second of all...:::['2-1-291']
ok.:::['2-1-293']
before i say anything i just need to know......is this one of those things where you break up with a guy.:::['2-1-294']
then i tell you what i think... ...and the next day you get back together with him......and i look like a complete idiot? - no, no, no.:::['2-1-295']
um, well, then, i think the guy's scum.:::['2-1-297']
i hate him. i mean, i actually... i physically hate him.:::['2-1-298']
you know? i always have.:::['2-1-299']
and you are way too good to be with a guy like that.:::['2-1-300']
really? - rach?:::['2-1-301']
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you......and who gets how funny... ...and sweet and amazing......and adorable and sexy you are.:::['2-1-302']
you know? someone who wakes up every morning thinking::::['2-1-303']
"oh, my god. i'm with rachel!" heh.:::['2-1-304']
you know? someone who makes you feel good.:::['2-1-305']
like the way i do with julie.:::['2-1-306']
was there a "second of all"?:::['2-1-307']
no, um, i think that was the whole "all.":::['2-1-308']
i gotta go. okay?:::['2-1-309']
okay. - thanks.:::['2-1-310']
no, i swear to god, dad! that's not how they measure pants!:::['2-1-312']
i was thinking of doing it shorter, like andie macdowell's haircut.:::['2-1-313']
oh, yeah. oh, i could do that. - really?:::['2-1-314']
yeah. you wanna do it now? - great!:::['2-1-315']
okay, i just wanna make really sure this time. uh-huh. ahem.:::['2-1-318']
andie macdowell is the girl from four weddings and a funeral, right?:::['2-1-319']
no, no, no, no, no, no. that's roddy mcdowall.:::['2-1-321']
andie macdowell is the guy from planet of the apes.:::['2-1-322']
oh! yeah, okay. - yeah. okay?:::['2-1-323']
hey, eddie. aah!:::['2-19-0']
what are you doing here? - watching you sleep.:::['2-19-1']
it makes me feel, um, peaceful.:::['2-19-3']
ha, ha. ahem. please.:::['2-19-4']
i can't sleep now!:::['2-19-5']
oh, you want me to sing?:::['2-19-6']
no. look.:::['2-19-7']
that's it. i want you out of the apartment now!:::['2-19-8']
oh, what are you talking about?:::['2-19-9']
hannibal lecter?:::['2-19-10']
better roommate than you.:::['2-19-11']
i don't think you're being fair! one night you see me, you get scared.:::['2-19-13']
what about the other nights when you don't see me, huh?:::['2-19-14']
last night you went and got some water......and i was nice enough to hide behind the door. what that about, huh?:::['2-19-15']
i didn't realize that. - ah.:::['2-19-16']
get out now!:::['2-19-17']
okay. you really want me out?:::['2-19-18']
then i want to hear you say you want me out.:::['2-19-20']
i want you out.:::['2-19-21']
i want to hear it from your lips.:::['2-19-22']
where'd you hear it before?:::['2-19-23']
oh, right, all right. you know what? consider me gone.:::['2-19-24']
i'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow.:::['2-19-25']
thank you. eddie: i heard that.:::['2-19-26']
friends s02e19: the one where eddie won't go:::['2-19-27']
thanks. - hey.:::['2-19-39']
well, look at you!:::['2-19-41']
finally got that time machine working, huh?:::['2-19-42']
you like it?:::['2-19-43']
this guy was selling them on 8th avenue and i thought::::['2-19-44']
"you know what i don't have?" - a mirror?:::['2-19-45']
fine, make fun. i think it's jaunty.:::['2-19-46']
wow! for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in a good mood.:::['2-19-47']
i'll be all right. i'm not starting from square one.:::['2-19-48']
i was dr. drake ramoray on days of our lives.:::['2-19-49']
huh? that's got to have some kind of cachet.:::['2-19-50']
cachet? jaunty?:::['2-19-51']
chandler gave me word-of-the-day toilet paper.:::['2-19-52']
i'm gonna get some coffee.:::['2-19-53', '4-2-177']
hey. monica & rachel: hey.:::['2-19-54']
oh! so? did you read the book?:::['2-19-55']
oh, my god. it was incredible!:::['2-19-56']
didn't it, like, totally speak to you?:::['2-19-57']
whoa, whoa, what book is this? - oh.:::['2-19-58']
uh! you have to read this book. it's called be your own wind keeper.:::['2-19-59']
ooh. it's about how women need to become more empowered.:::['2-19-60']
and, oh! but there's wind.:::['2-19-61']
and the wind can make us goddesses.:::['2-19-62']
do you know who takes our wind? men. they just take it.:::['2-19-63']
men just take our wind?:::['2-19-64']
uh-huh. all the time. because they are the lightning-bearers.:::['2-19-65']
wow. phoebe: yeah.:::['2-19-66']
that sounds kind of cool. it's like the hobbit.:::['2-19-67']
it is nothing like the hobbit.:::['2-19-68']
it's like reading about every relationship i've ever had.:::['2-19-69']
except for richard.:::['2-19-70']
oh, yes. no. richard would never steal your wind.:::['2-19-71']
no. phoebe: no.:::['2-19-72']
because he's yummy. - yes.:::['2-19-73']
but all the other ones.:::['2-19-74']
oh, and the part about how they're always drinking......from our pool of inner power.:::['2-19-75']
but god forbid we should take a sip.:::['2-19-76']
anybody want a cruller?:::['2-19-77']
this is a typical lightning-bearer thing.:::['2-19-78']
right there. it's like, um......"hello. who wants one of my phallic-shaped man-cakes?":::['2-19-79']
estelle: don't worry about it, already! things happen.:::['2-19-80']
so you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?:::['2-19-81']
joey, look at me.:::['2-19-82']
look at me!:::['2-19-83']
do i have lipstick on my teeth?:::['2-19-84']
uh, can we get back to me?:::['2-19-86']
look, honey. people get fired left and right in this business.:::['2-19-87']
i already got you an audition for another world.:::['2-19-88']
"cab driver number 2"?:::['2-19-90']
but... but i was dr. drake ramoray!:::['2-19-92']
how can i go from being a neurosurgeon to driving a cab?:::['2-19-93']
things change. roll with them.:::['2-19-94']
but this is a two-line part!:::['2-19-95']
it's like taking a step backwards.:::['2-19-96']
i'm not gonna do this.:::['2-19-97']
i'm gonna tell you the same thing i told al minza......and his pyramid of dogs.:::['2-19-99']
take any job you can get, and don't make on the floor.:::['2-19-100']
i'll see you.:::['2-19-102']
uh, god!:::['2-19-103']
oh, god! i mean, it's just so...:::['2-19-104']
isn't it?:::['2-19-105', '5-7-197', '5-17-288']
uh. this is like reading about my own life!:::['2-19-106']
this book could have been called be your own wind keeper, rachel!:::['2-19-107']
it wouldn't have sold a million copies......but it would've made a nice gift for you.:::['2-19-108']
hey, you guys. - hey.:::['2-19-109']
uh, sweetie, we've gotta go.:::['2-19-110']
no? heh.:::['2-19-112']
no! why do we always have to do everything according to your timetable?:::['2-19-113']
actually, it's the movie theater that has the timetable.:::['2-19-114']
it's so you don't miss the beginning.:::['2-19-115']
this isn't about the movie theater. this is about you stealing my wind.:::['2-19-116']
you go, girl!:::['2-19-117']
i can't pull that off, can i?:::['2-19-118']
excuse me, your wind?:::['2-19-119']
yes, my wind.:::['2-19-120']
how do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?:::['2-19-121']
you know i don't......have a problem with that.:::['2-19-122']
i just really need to be with myself right now.:::['2-19-124']
phoebe: mm, mm, mm. - uh, you're right.:::['2-19-126']
i don't have to apologize.:::['2-19-127']
sorry. damn it!:::['2-19-128']
what is it? - i don't know.:::['2-19-129']
it's got all this stuff about wind and trees......and some sacred pool.:::['2-19-130']
i don't really get it. but she's pretty upset about it.:::['2-19-131']
this is why i don't date women who read.:::['2-19-132']
what? what's that?:::['2-19-134']
it's my visa bill.:::['2-19-135']
envelope one of two.:::['2-19-136']
that can't be good. - open it, open it.:::['2-19-137']
oh, my god! - whoa!:::['2-19-138']
look at this! how did i spend so much money?:::['2-19-139']
uh, that's just the minimum amount. that's your total.:::['2-19-140']
whoa, whoa. thirty-five hundred dollars at "porcelain safari"?:::['2-19-142']
my animals.:::['2-19-143']
the guy said they suited me. he spoke with an accent. i was confused.:::['2-19-144']
i don't know what to do!:::['2-19-146']
you can start by driving a cab on another world.:::['2-19-147']
what? - that audition?:::['2-19-148']
that's a two-line part!:::['2-19-149']
joey, you owe $1100 at "i love lucite.":::['2-19-150']
so what? - so suck it up, man.:::['2-19-151']
it's a job. it's money.:::['2-19-152']
i don't need you getting judgmental and condescending and pedantic.:::['2-19-153']
toilet paper? - yeah.:::['2-19-154']
i'm not being any of those things. i'm being realistic.:::['2-19-155']
you're supposed to be my friend! - i am your friend.:::['2-19-156']
then tell me things like, "you'll be fine.":::['2-19-157']
and "something big's gonna come along. i know it!":::['2-19-158']
but i don't know it.:::['2-19-159']
what i do know is you owe $2300 at "isn't it chromantic?":::['2-19-160']
i'm aware of what i owe.:::['2-19-161']

wow, i am so glad i'm not monica right now.:::['2-18-158']
so, what's your magic number?:::['2-18-160']
ahh...:::['2-18-161']
come on, you know everyone i've been with. all both of them.:::['2-18-162']
well, ahem, there's you.:::['2-18-163']
better not be doing these in order.:::['2-18-164']
okay, uh, billy dreskin, pete carny.:::['2-18-165']
ah. - barry.:::['2-18-166']
and, uh, oh, paolo.:::['2-18-167']
oh, yes, the weenie from turinie.:::['2-18-168']
oh, honey, are you jealous of paolo?:::['2-18-169']
i'm so much happier with you than i ever was with him.:::['2-18-170']
really? - oh, please.:::['2-18-171']
that paolo thing was barely a relationship.:::['2-18-172']
all it really was was just meaningless, animal sex.:::['2-18-173']
okay, you know, that sounded so much better in my head.:::['2-18-174']
eddie! i didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend.:::['2-18-175']
that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say.:::['2-18-176']
this is nuts! crazy! she came over for two minutes......dropped off a fish tank and left! end of story.:::['2-18-177']
where's buddy? - buddy?:::['2-18-178']
my fish, buddy.:::['2-18-179']
there was no fish when she dropped it off.:::['2-18-180']
oh, this is unbelievable!:::['2-18-181']
you sleep with my ex-girlfriend, insult my intelligence by lying......then you kill my fish? my buddy?:::['2-18-182']
i didn't kill your fish!:::['2-18-183']
look, eddie...:::['2-18-184']
would you look at what i'm doing?:::['2-18-185']
now that can't be smart.:::['2-18-186']
so we're just gonna take this guy right off you......and put him here in mr. pocket.:::['2-18-187']
tangelo?:::['2-18-188']
that's it? that's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?:::['2-18-189']
well, yeah. - well, that's not bad at all.:::['2-18-190']
you had me thinking it was, like, a fleet.:::['2-18-191']
you're okay with it?:::['2-18-192']
oh, honey, i'm fine.:::['2-18-193']
okay, about that two.:::['2-18-195']
what about my two?:::['2-18-198']
it just seems like a really small number.:::['2-18-199']
and? - and, well...:::['2-18-201']
don't you have a lot of wild oats to sow?:::['2-18-202']
or is that what you're doing with me? oh, my god! am i an oat?:::['2-18-203']
honey, you are not an oat.:::['2-18-204']
i don't know, i guess i'm just not an oat guy.:::['2-18-205']
i've only slept with women i love.:::['2-18-206']
you've only slept with two people.:::['2-18-207']
you know i love you too, right?:::['2-18-211']
now i do.:::['2-18-212']
ugh, ross!:::['2-18-213']
ross, please listen to me.:::['2-18-214']
ross, you are so much better for me than paolo ever was.:::['2-18-215']
you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh.:::['2-18-216']
if i make you laugh, here's an idea.:::['2-18-217']
invite paolo to have a romp in the sack, and i'll stand in the corner......and tell knock-knock jokes. - ross! agh!:::['2-18-218']
god, ross!:::['2-18-219']
what you and i have is special! all paolo and i ever had was...:::['2-18-220']
animal sex, animal sex?:::['2-18-221']
there's nothing between us "animal" at all?:::['2-18-223']
there's not even, like, um, a little animal?:::['2-18-224']
not even, like......chipmunk sex?:::['2-18-225']
okay, ross...:::['2-18-226']
try to hear me, okay?:::['2-18-227']
i... hey. i'm not gonna lie to you.:::['2-18-228']
it was good with paolo. - knock-knock.:::['2-18-229']
but what you and i have is so much better.:::['2-18-230']
we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect.:::['2-18-231']
you know? i swear.:::['2-18-232']
this is the best......i have ever had.:::['2-18-233']
until now. - aah!:::['2-18-234']
oh, hi. - hi.:::['2-18-235', '2-21-87']
richard told me he loved me.:::['2-18-236']
oh, my god! - i know!:::['2-18-237']
honey, that's great!:::['2-18-238']
i know! - ha, ha.:::['2-18-239']
i just can't find... - top drawer.:::['2-18-240']
hurry. - why? you need one too?:::['2-18-241']
found them! - whoo.:::['2-18-243']
there's only one.:::['2-18-244']
monica! - hi.:::['2-18-245']
uh, we'll be right there. we're just trying to decide something.:::['2-18-246']
they're trying to decide something. - good. good, good.:::['2-18-249']
so is, um... so was your mustache... did it used to be different?:::['2-18-250']
no. - oh.:::['2-18-251']
how do you, uh, you know, keep it so neat?:::['2-18-252']
i have a little comb. - oh.:::['2-18-253']
what do you call that? - a mustache comb.:::['2-18-254']
okay, i will do your laundry for one month.:::['2-18-256']
no! - okay, okay!:::['2-18-257']
i will, i will, i will...:::['2-18-258']
i will clean the apartment for two months.:::['2-18-259']
i'll give this to you now, if you tell me where we keep the dustpan.:::['2-18-260']
so were you in nam?:::['2-18-261']
rock, paper, scissors? - gotcha.:::['2-18-262']
yes! - agh!:::['2-18-264']
ah! - fine. go have sex.:::['2-18-265']
richard: no! you have got it completely wrong!:::['2-18-266']
john savage was deer hunter, no legs.:::['2-18-267']
jon voight was coming home, couldn't feel his legs.:::['2-18-268']
no, you've got it totally the other way around, my friend. jon voight...:::['2-18-269']
honey? ahem. - what? oh.:::['2-18-270']
shall we? - it's not gonna happen.:::['2-18-271']
they're doing it tonight. we can do it tomorrow.:::['2-18-272']
uh, in the future, if i could see the schedule beforehand...:::['2-18-273']
so when i woke up this morning......he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes!:::['2-18-274']
he thinks i slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish.:::['2-18-276']
why would you kill his fish?:::['2-18-277']
because sometimes after you sleep with someone......you have to kill a fish.:::['2-18-278']
chandler, honey......i'm sorry.:::['2-18-279']
can we watch joey's show now, please?:::['2-18-280']
yeah! - wait. he's not here yet.:::['2-18-281']
he's on the show, he knows what happens.:::['2-18-282']
i'm fine about my problem now, by the way.:::['2-18-283']
amber......i want you to know i'll always be there for you......as a friend and as your brother.:::['2-18-284']
doctor: hard day, huh?:::['2-18-286']
first the medical award, now this? - yeah.:::['2-18-287']
some guys are just lucky, i guess. ha, ha. - ha-ha-ha.:::['2-18-288']
woman: dr. ramoray......report to first floor emergency stat. - hmm.:::['2-18-289']
well, then......l, uh, guess that's me.:::['2-18-290']
anyone else need to go on the elevator? dr. horton? dr. wong?:::['2-18-291']
no, no. they only said you.:::['2-18-292']
oh, okay. all right.:::['2-18-293']
i love you, drake. - yeah, whatever.:::['2-18-294']
oh, no! amber: drake, look out!:::['2-18-295']
did they just kill off joey? - no!:::['2-18-296']
now maybe.:::['2-18-297']
ross: come on! open up! we want to talk to you!:::['2-18-298']
i don't feel like talking!:::['2-18-299']
rachel: come on! we care about you.:::['2-18-300']
chandler: we're worried about you. monica: and some of us have to pee!:::['2-18-301']
i'm sorry, joey.:::['2-18-302']
listen, sorry about your death. that really sucks.:::['2-18-303']
we came over as soon as we saw. - how could you not tell us?:::['2-18-304']
i don't know. i was kind of hoping no one would ever find out.:::['2-18-305']
well, maybe they could find a way to bring you back.:::['2-18-306']
no, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in......that the only doctor who could've saved me was me.:::['2-18-307']
it's supposed to be some kind of irony.:::['2-18-308']
but joey, you're gonna be fine.:::['2-18-309']
you don't need that show. it was just a dumb soap opera.:::['2-18-310']
this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me.:::['2-18-311']
yes! i was going to incorporate that.:::['2-18-312']
oh, good, here's monica. she'll have something nice to say.:::['2-18-313']
um, i straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew.:::['2-18-314']
what? to me, that's nice.:::['2-18-315']
it's gonna be okay. you know that.:::['2-18-316']
it's like you work your whole life for something......and you think that when you get it......it'll never be as good as you thought.:::['2-18-318']
but this so was.:::['2-18-319']
it changed everything.:::['2-18-320']
like, the other day, i got this credit card application......and i was pre-approved!:::['2-18-321']
huh? i've never been pre-approved for anything in my life!:::['2-18-322']
i don't know if this'll mean anything to you......but you'll always be pre-approved with us.:::['2-18-324']
no, that means nothing to me.:::['2-18-325']
ahh!:::['2-18-326']
pecan sandy? just made them.:::['2-18-327']
are these raisins?:::['2-18-329']
uh, sure, why not?:::['2-18-330']
listen, eddie. um, ahem.:::['2-18-331']
i've been thinking about our living situation and, uh...:::['2-18-332']
why are you smiling?:::['2-18-333']
i got a little surprise. look. there's a new fishy.:::['2-18-334']
i named him, uh......chandler, you know, after you.:::['2-18-335']
well, that's not even a real fish.:::['2-18-336']
no, that's a goldfish cracker.:::['2-18-337']
so, what's your point, man?:::['2-18-338']
okay, good night.:::['2-18-339']
you big freak of nature.:::['2-18-340']
whoo. brisk tonight. - oh, man.:::['2-18-344']
let's never speak of this. - you got it.:::['2-18-345']
rachel: how did the audition go? - incredible.:::['2-24-0']
i met the director. you'll never believe who it was.:::['2-24-1']
i'll give you one hint.:::['2-24-3']
warren beatty.:::['2-24-4']
there's just one thing that might be a problem.:::['2-24-6']
see, i had to kiss this guy.:::['2-24-7']
because he was just so darn cute?:::['2-24-8']
no, part of the audition. i'm up for the part of this guy......who the main guy kisses.:::['2-24-9']
well, you're an actor. i say you just suck it up and you do it.:::['2-24-10']
or you just do it.:::['2-24-11']
i did do it. i'm a professional.:::['2-24-12']
what's the problem? joey: after the scene......mr. beatty comes up to me and he says, "good actor. bad kisser.":::['2-24-13']
can you believe that? me, not a good kisser.:::['2-24-14']
that's like......mother teresa, not a good mother. pfft.:::['2-24-15']
who cares what that guy thinks?:::['2-24-16']
what does warren beatty know about kissing? heh.:::['2-24-17']
oh. heh, heh.:::['2-24-18']
friends s02e24: the one with barry and mindy's wedding:::['2-24-19']
chandler: what did your agent say?:::['2-24-31']
yep. this kiss thing is definitely a problem.:::['2-24-32']
mr. beatty wants to see it again on monday.:::['2-24-33']
man, i gotta figure out what i'm doing wrong.:::['2-24-34']
oh, okay. one of you girls come over here and kiss me.:::['2-24-35']
forget it. - yeah, right.:::['2-24-36']
hey, come on. i need your help here.:::['2-24-37']
i'll do it. i've kissed him before. i can do it again.:::['2-24-38']
see this, huh? this is a friend.:::['2-24-39']
uh-huh. let's go.:::['2-24-40']
oh, wait. i have gum.:::['2-24-41']
good. very good. firm, but tender.:::['2-24-43']
i'd recommend you to a friend.:::['2-24-44']
then i don't know what the problem is.:::['2-24-45']
maybe you're not used to kissing men.:::['2-24-46']
maybe you tensed up a little.:::['2-24-47']
maybe you need to work on it.:::['2-24-48']
yeah, that makes sense.:::['2-24-49']
over my dead body.:::['2-24-50']
and i'll be using his dead body as a shield.:::['2-24-51']
come out, honey. i'm telling you, you look good.:::['2-24-52']
tell her she looks good. tell her she looks good.:::['2-24-53']
oh, my god! ha, ha, ha.:::['2-24-54']
you look so good!:::['2-24-55']
i cannot believe i have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people......looking like something you drink when you're nauseous.:::['2-24-56']
so don't. i don't see why we have to go to this thing.:::['2-24-57']
it's your ex-fiancé's wedding.:::['2-24-58']
because i promised mindy i would.:::['2-24-59']
yeah, well, you promised barry you'd marry him.:::['2-24-60']
rachel: you guys, i have to go. i'm the maid of honor.:::['2-24-61']
besides, i need to be in a room again with these people......and feel good about myself.:::['2-24-62']
someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. get a little action?:::['2-24-63']
i may have.:::['2-24-64']
whoo-hoo! stud!:::['2-24-65']
what's she look like? chandler: we haven't met.:::['2-24-66']
we stayed up all night talking on the internet.:::['2-24-67']
whoo-hoo! geek!:::['2-24-68']
i like this girl. i seriously like this girl.:::['2-24-69']
you know how i tend to get a little defended and quippy?:::['2-24-70']
get out. - no. please.:::['2-24-71']
well, she called me on it, okay? she said, "cut it out, get real.":::['2-24-72']
and i did.:::['2-24-73']
what's that like?:::['2-24-75', '5-20-77']
it's like this. me.:::['2-24-76']
no jokes.:::['2-24-77']
stop it. you're freaking me out.:::['2-24-78']
yeah. i don't like you this way.:::['2-24-79']
richard: i'll see you guys later.:::['2-24-80']
rachel: bye, richard. - bye-bye.:::['2-24-81']
bye, sweetie. i love you.:::['2-24-82']
i think my boyfriend's ever so dreamy.:::['2-24-84']
i wonder what our wedding will be like.:::['2-24-85']
what are you talking about? what wedding?:::['2-24-86']
come on. you never talk about that?:::['2-24-87']
no, never.:::['2-24-88']
we're just living in the moment.:::['2-24-89']
it is so nice for once not to get hung up on, "where is this going?":::['2-24-90']
afraid to ask him? - could not be more terrified.:::['2-24-91']
i think you should seriously consider marriage.:::['2-24-92']
give rachel another chance to dress like princess bubble yum.:::['2-24-93']
monica: where's benny?:::['2-24-94']
there he is!:::['2-24-95', '2-24-97', '3-1-134']
where's benny?:::['2-24-96']
that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grownups to cut it out.:::['2-24-98']
hey, i got a question for you.:::['2-24-99']
just a little thing, no pressure.:::['2-24-100']
do you ever, uh, think about the future?:::['2-24-102']
sure, i do.:::['2-24-103']
yeah? am i in it?:::['2-24-104']
honey......you are it.:::['2-24-105']
oh, god. you're about to get so lucky.:::['2-24-106']
keep talking. - well......sometimes i think about selling my practice.:::['2-24-108']
we could move to france.:::['2-24-109']
make french toast. - ooh.:::['2-24-110']
okay, so......we're in france......and we're making the toast.:::['2-24-111']
do you see a little bassinet in the corner?:::['2-24-112']
like a hound?:::['2-24-113']
not a basset.:::['2-24-114']
a bassinet.:::['2-24-115']
you really need the bassinet?:::['2-24-116']
well, i just think the baby would keep falling off the dog.:::['2-24-117']
do you not see kids in our future? - oh. heh.:::['2-24-118']
i love children.:::['2-24-119']
i have children.:::['2-24-120']
i don't wanna be 70 when our kids go off to college......and our life can finally start.:::['2-24-121']
hm. - look.:::['2-24-122']
i want you......now.:::['2-24-123']
well, that's great. we don't need to talk about this now.:::['2-24-124']
really, i mean this is so, like, way, way, way in the future.:::['2-24-125']
i'm talking hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. heh, heh.:::['2-24-126']
come on, chandler. i want this part so much.:::['2-24-127']
just one kiss. i won't tell anyone.:::['2-24-128']
joey, no means no.:::['2-24-129']
i'm sorry, we don't have your sheep.:::['2-24-131']
aw, rach, i think you look cute.:::['2-24-132']
and you. you...:::['2-24-133']
you, i could eat you with a spoon. - get away from me. i said no.:::['2-24-134']
richard buzzed. he's downstairs.:::['2-24-135']
richard's here? i should run down, say goodbye to him.:::['2-24-136']
rachel: bye. phoebe: good luck.:::['2-24-137']
how's your date with your cyber-chick going?:::['2-24-138']
hey, what is all that?:::['2-24-139']
it's a web site. it's the guggenheim museum.:::['2-24-140']
she likes art......and i like funny words.:::['2-24-141']
what does she mean by "h.h."?:::['2-24-142']
it means we're holding hands.:::['2-24-143']
are you the cutest?:::['2-24-144']
i'm afraid i might just be.:::['2-24-145']
i think it's so great that you're totally into this person......yet for all you know, she could be 90 years old or have two heads.:::['2-24-146']
it could be a guy.:::['2-24-147']
it's not a guy, all right? i know her.:::['2-24-148']
it could be like a big, giant guy.:::['2-24-149']
man, i got this close to him, and monica kneed me in the back.:::['2-24-150']
we're wondering if chandler's girlfriend is a girl.:::['2-24-152']
ask her how long she's gonna live.:::['2-24-153']
women live longer than men.:::['2-24-154']
how do you not fall down more?:::['2-24-155']
okay, ask her what is her method of birth control.:::['2-24-156']
"my husband is sleeping with his secretary.":::['2-24-158']
she's married?:::['2-24-159']
at least we know she's a woman.:::['2-24-160']
i can't believe she's married.:::['2-24-161']
oh, man, i'm sorry.:::['2-24-162']
this must be really tough for you.:::['2-24-163']
i read this article that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings......because when pigeons eat rice, it kills them.:::['2-24-164']
that's why you never see pigeons in sushi bars.:::['2-24-165']
see, we're having fun. - oh, absolutely.:::['2-24-166']
i'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not gonna think about.:::['2-24-167']
neither am i.:::['2-24-168']
hey, there. are you all right?:::['2-24-169']
yeah. but in the bathroom, i saw the window i crawled out of at my wedding.:::['2-24-170']
and, god, i just started thinking i shouldn't be here. i shouldn't.:::['2-24-171']
people are gonna be looking at me and judging me and thinking about the last time.:::['2-24-172']
sweetie, it's gonna be okay. it's a wedding.:::['2-24-173']
generally, people focus on the bride.:::['2-24-174']
i know, you're right.:::['2-24-175']
alrighty. everybody look at me. good.:::['2-24-176']
it's time. bridesmaids and ushers......let's see two lines. thank you.:::['2-24-177']
i'll see you after the thing.:::['2-24-178']
okay. good luck. - thank you. okay.:::['2-24-179']
why didn't you tell me?:::['2-24-182', '4-23-133']
what could i do?:::['2-24-183']
stand up and shout, "hey, rachel, your butt is showing!":::['2-24-184']
oh, my god. this is so humiliating.:::['2-24-185']
the only thing that tops that was when i was in eighth grade......and i had to sing the "copacabana" in front of the entire school.:::['2-24-186']
two lines into it, i ran and freaked out.:::['2-24-187']
oh, my god. my entire life's flashing before my eyes.:::['2-24-188']
rach, look, i remember that. it wasn't so bad.:::['2-24-189']
ross, would you stop! you got me. i'm dating you.:::['2-24-190']
mr. weinberg: rachel.:::['2-24-191']
hi, mr. weinberg. hi, mrs. weinberg.:::['2-24-192']
it's wonderful to see you again, my dear.:::['2-24-193']
in fact, i hardly expected to see so much.:::['2-24-194']
you told me you didn't see anything. - i tell you a lot of things.:::['2-24-195']
well, it's wonderful to have you up and about again, dear.:::['2-24-196']
mr. weinberg: stay well.:::['2-24-197']
that's the third time someone has said something like that to me today.:::['2-24-198']
rach! rachel: hi.:::['2-24-199']
oh, my god, i'm married! - i know!:::['2-24-200']
i'm mrs. dr. barry hunter, hyphen, farber.:::['2-24-201']
i am so proud of you, min.:::['2-24-202']
min.:::['2-24-203']
oh, rach. still here.:::['2-24-204']
at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now.:::['2-24-205']
yeah, i love that story.:::['2-24-206']
ahem. i have a question for you guys.:::['2-24-207']
why do people keep saying it's good to see me up and about?:::['2-24-208']
after you ran out on your wedding......barry's parents told people you were sort of......insane.:::['2-24-209']
insane? - from the syphilis.:::['2-24-210']
what were they gonna say? you didn't love me anymore? come on.:::['2-24-212']
angela?:::['2-24-213']
listen, what are you doing tonight?:::['2-24-215']
i know you're seeing that guy. i was thinking maybe you could bring him...:::['2-24-216']
you gonna answer her? that's the 10th bing-bong message she's sent.:::['2-24-218']
she wants to know what's wrong. - what's wrong? you're married!:::['2-24-219']
that's what's wrong!:::['2-24-220']
what? - she wants to meet you in person.:::['2-24-222']
look, phoebe, i wanted to meet her in person too.:::['2-24-223']
but she's married. she has a husband.:::['2-24-224']
what if the husband is the wrong guy and you are the right guy?:::['2-24-225']
you don't get chances like this all the time.:::['2-24-226']
if you don't meet her, you'll kick yourself when you're 80......which is hard to do and that's how you break a hip.:::['2-24-227']
okay. i'll do it.:::['2-24-228']
okay, great! put on your shoes and then march out there and meet her.:::['2-24-229']
no, wait! you have to take a shower because ew!:::['2-24-230']
and i'll get the...:::['2-24-231']
no, you have to answer her. answer her first.:::['2-24-232']
no, make some coffee because it's too much.:::['2-24-233']
man: tall and tan, and young and lovely:::['2-24-234']
okay, one more, please. i'm gonna get it in this time.:::['2-24-235']
okay, last chance.:::['2-24-236']
again, i'm sorry.:::['2-24-237']
you know what, maybe i don't need to have children.:::['2-24-238']
maybe i just think i do because that's what society......and by that i mean my mom......has always convinced me that i...:::['2-24-239']
<i>but i want her so badly</i>:::['2-24-240']
i have to have children. i'm sorry, i just do.:::['2-24-242']
best man: yo, could i have your attention?:::['2-24-243']
best man making a toast here.:::['2-24-244']
thank you. ahem.:::['2-24-245']
i remember when barry got home from his first date with rachel.:::['2-24-246']
woman: huh?:::['2-24-247']
what? you hired the same band. i can't use the same speech?:::['2-24-248']
anyway, i wish you both......a wonderful life together. mindy: aw.:::['2-24-250']
and, rachel.:::['2-24-251']
what? - no, no, in all seriousness.:::['2-24-252']
not a lot of women would have the guts to come back here.:::['2-24-253']
and even fewer who'd do it with their asses hanging out.:::['2-24-254']
i'd like to add something to that.:::['2-24-256']
what are you adding? what are you adding? - it's okay. it's okay.:::['2-24-257']
most of you don't know me. i'm rachel's boyfriend...:::['2-24-258']
...ross.:::['2-24-260']
and i'd just like to say that......it did take a lot of courage for rachel to come here tonight.:::['2-24-261']
and just for the record......she did not run out on barry because she had syphilis.:::['2-24-262']
what are you doing? i'm serious.:::['2-24-263']
the reason......she walked out on barry is simply that......she didn't love him.:::['2-24-264']
which, incidentally, worked out pretty well for me. heh, heh.:::['2-24-265']
see you in the parking lot. - no, rach.:::['2-24-267']
barry: and once again, she is out of here!:::['2-24-268']
okay, who had 9:45? hm?:::['2-24-269']
rachel: heh.:::['2-24-270']
you know what, bar? i'm not gonna leave.:::['2-24-271']
i probably should, but i'm not.:::['2-24-272']
i promised myself i'd make it through at least one of your weddings.:::['2-24-273']
tonight, all i wanted was to make it through this evening......with a little bit of grace and dignity.:::['2-24-274']
well, i guess we can all agree that's not gonna happen.:::['2-24-275']
i guess there's nothing really left to say......except...:::['2-24-276']
singing: her name was lola:::['2-24-277']
she was a showgirl:::['2-24-278']
with yellow feath...:::['2-24-279']
feathers in her hair:::['2-24-280']
and a dress cut down to there:::['2-24-281']
she would...:::['2-24-282']
merengue - merengue:::['2-24-283']
thank you, honey.:::['2-24-284']
and do the cha-cha:::['2-24-285']
and while she'd like to be a star tony always tended bar:::['2-24-286']
wait, wait!:::['2-24-287']
all: copa:::['2-24-289']
copacabana:::['2-24-290', '2-24-293']
the hottest spot north of havana:::['2-24-291']
at the copa:::['2-24-292']
music and passion were always in fashion at the copa:::['2-24-294']
<i>there's a somebody i'm longing...</i>:::['2-24-295']
i'll do it.:::['2-24-297', '5-2-92']
you'll do what?:::['2-24-298']
if kids is what it takes to be with you, then kids it is.:::['2-24-299']
if i have to, i'll do it all again.:::['2-24-301']
i'll do the 4:00 feeding thing.:::['2-24-302']
i'll go to the pta meetings.:::['2-24-303']
i'll coach the soccer team.:::['2-24-304']
really? - yeah, if i have to.:::['2-24-305']
monica......i don't wanna lose you.:::['2-24-306']
so if i have to do it all again......then i will.:::['2-24-307']
you are the most wonderful man.:::['2-24-308']
and if you hadn't have said......"if i have to," like, 17 times......then i'd be saying, "okay, let's do it.":::['2-24-309']
but you're not.:::['2-24-310']
oh, my god. i can't believe what i'm getting ready to say.:::['2-24-311']
i wanna have a baby.:::['2-24-312']
but i don't want to have one with someone who doesn't really want to have one.:::['2-24-313']
i know you do.:::['2-24-316']
so what now?:::['2-24-318']
i guess we just......keep dancing.:::['2-24-319']
<i>someone to watch</i>:::['2-24-320']
<i>over me</i>:::['2-24-321']
chandler: where is she? where is she?:::['2-24-322']
oh, hey, i have a question.:::['2-24-323']
where is she?:::['2-24-324', '5-1-206']
chandler. relax, chandler. she'll be here.:::['2-24-325']
chandler: oh, oh, oh. that's her.:::['2-24-326']
yeah, because life's just that kind.:::['2-24-327']
phoebe: you gotta stop staring at the door......like a watched pot.:::['2-24-328']
if you keep looking at it, the door's never gonna boil.:::['2-24-329']
i think what you have to do is try not to...:::['2-24-330']
group: oh......my......god.:::['2-24-333']
i've been feeling incredibly guilty because i wanna be a good friend.:::['2-24-335']
and damn it, i am a good friend. so shut up and close your eyes.:::['2-24-336']
the audition was this morning, and i didn't get it.:::['2-24-339']
but that was a hell of a kiss.:::['2-24-340']
rachel is a very lucky girl.:::['2-24-341']
okay, these were expensive, and he's gonna grow out of them......in 20 minutes, but i couldn't resist!:::['2-2-0']
phoebe: look at these.:::['2-2-1']
"just do it"! unh!:::['2-2-3']
oh, my god! oh!:::['2-2-4']
was that too much pressure for him?:::['2-2-5']
oh, is he hungry already? aw. - i guess so.:::['2-2-6']
you know, it's...:::['2-2-7']
something funny about sneakers. i'll be right back.:::['2-2-8']
oh, uh, i gotta get one too.:::['2-2-9']
we're just hanging out by the spoons.:::['2-2-11']
ladle?:::['2-2-12']
will you guys grow up?:::['2-2-13']
this is the most natural, beautiful thing in the world.:::['2-2-14']
yeah, we know. but there's a baby sucking on it.:::['2-2-15']
this is my son having lunch, okay? it'll happen a lot, so get used to it.:::['2-2-16']
if you have a problem, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions.:::['2-2-17']
carol's fine with it. come on.:::['2-2-18']
carol? - carol.:::['2-2-19']
i was wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?:::['2-2-20']
sure. - uh...:::['2-2-21']
does it hurt?:::['2-2-22']
it did at first, but not anymore.:::['2-2-23']
so, uh, how often can you do it?:::['2-2-25']
as much as he needs.:::['2-2-26']
oh, okay, i got one, i got one. uh...:::['2-2-27']
if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?:::['2-2-28']
friends s02e02: the one with the breast milk:::['2-2-29']
rachel, do you have muffins left? - yeah, i forget which ones.:::['2-2-41']
oh, you're busy, i'll get it.:::['2-2-42']
anyone else want one? - no, thanks.:::['2-2-43']
no, i'm all set.:::['2-2-44']
oh, you're losing your apron. let me get it.:::['2-2-45']
oh. - there you go.:::['2-2-46']
ugh, what a bitch.:::['2-2-48']
listen, guys, i have a friend at bloomingdale's who's quitting......and he wants to abuse his discount.:::['2-2-49']
so anyone want to come take advantage of it?:::['2-2-50']
i can't. i have to take my grandmother to the vet.:::['2-2-51']
okay. um, i'll go with you. julie: great.:::['2-2-52']
ross: hi, honey. - hey, sweetums.:::['2-2-53']
and hello to the rest. all: hi.:::['2-2-54']

it's gonna be a problem, isn't it? - come on.:::['2-2-57']
you're going to bloomingdale's with julie.:::['2-2-58']
it's like cheating on rachel in her house of worship.:::['2-2-59']
but i... - monica, she will kill you.:::['2-2-60']
she will kill you like a dog in the street!:::['2-2-61']
so, uh, jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow.:::['2-2-62']
yeah, um, it's actually not that big a deal. in fact...:::['2-2-63']
it's a big deal to me. this is great. i really appreciate this.:::['2-2-64']
bijan for men?:::['2-2-66', '2-2-67', '2-2-102', '2-2-111']
hey, annabel. - hey, joey.:::['2-2-68']
did you hear about the new guy? - who?:::['2-2-69']
nobody knows his name. me and the girls call him "the hombre man.":::['2-2-70']
hombre?:::['2-2-71', '2-2-81']
what's he doing in my section?:::['2-2-72']
i guess he doesn't know.:::['2-2-73']
well, he's gonna.:::['2-2-74']
i'll see you a little later, okay?:::['2-2-75']
hey, how you doing?:::['2-2-76']
listen, uh, heh. i know you're new......but, uh, it's kind of understood that everything......from young men's to the escalator is, uh, my territory.:::['2-2-78']
your territory, huh? - yeah.:::['2-2-79']
bijan for men? - no, thanks.:::['2-2-80']
phoebe, listen. you were with me, and we were shopping all day.:::['2-2-84']

you went shopping for fur? - yeah.:::['2-2-94']
and then i realized that i'm against that and, um...:::['2-2-95']

you ready, annabel?:::['2-2-107']
you bet.:::['2-2-108']
maybe some other time. - yeah.:::['2-2-109']
it's not the first time i lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne.:::['2-2-110']
bijan for men!:::['2-2-112']
okay, and this is funny clown.:::['2-2-113']
funny clown is only for after his naps, not before or he won't sleep.:::['2-2-114']
we've been through this before. we have a good time.:::['2-2-115']
we laugh, we play. it's like we're father and son.:::['2-2-116']
honey, relax. ross is great with him.:::['2-2-117']
don't look so surprised. i'm a lovely person.:::['2-2-118']
oh, this is so cute.:::['2-2-119']
ah, i got that for him!:::['2-2-120']
"my mommies love me.":::['2-2-121']
that's clever.:::['2-2-122']
oh, hi, jul...:::['2-2-124']
hi, jew!:::['2-2-125']
uh-huh. okay, um, sure.:::['2-2-126']
that'd be great. see you then. bye.:::['2-2-127']
did you just say, "hi, jew"?:::['2-2-128']
yes. um, yes, i did.:::['2-2-129']
that was my friend eddie moskowitz.:::['2-2-130']
yeah, he likes it. reaffirms his faith.:::['2-2-131']
ben, dinner!:::['2-2-132']
thanks, aunt pheebs.:::['2-2-133']
you didn't microwave that, did you? it's breast milk, you're not supposed to.:::['2-2-134']
duh, i think i know how to heat breast milk. heh.:::['2-2-135']
what did you just do?:::['2-2-137', '2-2-143']
i licked my arm, what?:::['2-2-138']
it's breast milk!:::['2-2-139']
phoebe, that is juice squeezed from a person.:::['2-2-141']
what is the big deal? ross: no, no...:::['2-2-142']
can people stop drinking the breast milk?:::['2-2-144']
you won't even taste it? - no.:::['2-2-145']
not even if you just pretend it's milk?:::['2-2-146']
not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.:::['2-2-147']
hey. - hi.:::['2-2-148']
where is everybody? - took ben to the park.:::['2-2-149']
where have you been? - just out.:::['2-2-150']
had some lunch. just me. a little quality time with me.:::['2-2-151']
hey, thanks for your jacket. - oh, no problem.:::['2-2-152']
you can borrow it, by the way. - heh.:::['2-2-153']
oh, here are your keys, honey. - thank you.:::['2-2-154']
mon? - mm-hmm?:::['2-2-155']
if, uh, you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you $53?:::['2-2-156']
you know what probably happened?:::['2-2-157']
someone must have stolen my credit card. - ah.:::['2-2-158']
and put the receipt back in your pocket?:::['2-2-159']
huh. that is an excellent, excellent question.:::['2-2-160']
that is excellent.:::['2-2-161']
what's with you? who did you have lunch with?:::['2-2-162']
judy. - who?:::['2-2-163']
julie. jody? - what?:::['2-2-164']
you were with julie? - mm. look.:::['2-2-165']
when it started, i was just trying to be nice to her......because she was my brother's girlfriend.:::['2-2-166']
and then one thing led to another......and before i knew it, we were......shopping. - aah.:::['2-2-167']
wait, we only did it once.:::['2-2-169']
it didn't mean anything to me.:::['2-2-170']
yeah, right. sure. - really!:::['2-2-171']
rachel, i was thinking of you the whole time.:::['2-2-172']
look, i'm sorry, all right? i never meant for you to find out.:::['2-2-173']
oh, please! please! you wanted to get caught!:::['2-2-174']
that is not true!:::['2-2-175']
so you just happened to leave it in here?:::['2-2-176']
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid?:::['2-2-177']
okay, monica, i just have to know one thing.:::['2-2-178']
did you go with her to bloomingdale's?:::['2-2-179']
okay, i just really, um... i just need to not be with you right now.:::['2-2-181']
hi, who's this?:::['2-2-182']
hi, joanne. is rachel working? it's monica.:::['2-2-183']
yes, i know i did a horrible thing.:::['2-2-184']
joanne, it's not as simple as all that, okay?:::['2-2-185']
no, i don't care what steve thinks. hi, steve.:::['2-2-186']
hey! phoebe: hi!:::['2-2-187']
how did we do?:::['2-2-188']
oh, i tasted ben's milk and ross freaked out.:::['2-2-189']
i... i did not freak out.:::['2-2-190']
why'd you freak out? - because it's breast milk.:::['2-2-191']
it's gross!:::['2-2-192']
my breast milk is gross?:::['2-2-193']
this should be fun.:::['2-2-194']
no, carol. there's nothing wrong with it.:::['2-2-195']
i just don't think breast milk is for adults.:::['2-2-196']
of course, the packaging does appeal to grownups and kids.:::['2-2-197']
ross, you're being silly. i've tried it. it's no big deal.:::['2-2-198']
come on, just taste it. - ha-ha-ha.:::['2-2-199']
that would be no.:::['2-2-200']
come on. - try it.:::['2-2-201']
it's natural. - it doesn't taste bad.:::['2-2-202']
yeah, it tastes kind of sweet. sort of like, uh...:::['2-2-203']
like what? - cantaloupe juice.:::['2-2-204']
exactly.:::['2-2-205']
you've tasted it.:::['2-2-206', '2-2-207']
oh, you've tasted it.:::['2-2-208']
you can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true.:::['2-2-209']
give me the bottle.:::['2-2-210']
get me the towel.:::['2-2-211']
howdy.:::['2-2-212']
give me a box ofjuice.:::['2-2-213']
well, they switched me over to hombre.:::['2-2-214']
maybe it's because of the way you're dressed.:::['2-2-215']
or maybe this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it.:::['2-2-216']
this guy goes through two bottles a day now.:::['2-2-217']
what do you care?:::['2-2-218']
you're an actor. this is your day job. isn't supposed to mean anything.:::['2-2-219']
i know, but i was the best.:::['2-2-220']
you know? i liked being the best.:::['2-2-221']
maybe i should get out of the game.:::['2-2-222']
they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese.:::['2-2-223']
say you do that.:::['2-2-224']
sooner or later, somebody will come along that slices a better cheddar.:::['2-2-225']
and then where you gonna run?:::['2-2-226']
i guess you're right. - damn right i'm right.:::['2-2-227']
show this guy what you're made of. stand your ground.:::['2-2-228']
show him that you're the baddest hombre west of the lingerie!:::['2-2-229']
i'm gonna do it! - all right!:::['2-2-230']
now, go see miss kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.:::['2-2-231']
monica: i don't know what to say.:::['2-2-232']
that works good because i'm not listening.:::['2-2-233']
i feel terrible. i really do.:::['2-2-234']
oh, i'm sorry. did my back hurt your knife?:::['2-2-235']
say that i'm friends with her. we spend time together.:::['2-2-237']
is that so terrible? - yes.:::['2-2-238']
it's that terrible? - yes, monica! you don't get it.:::['2-2-239']
it's bad enough she stole the guy......who may be the person i'm supposed to be with.:::['2-2-240']
but now......she's actually...:::['2-2-241']
but now she's actually stealing you!:::['2-2-242']
nobody could steal me from you.:::['2-2-245']
because i'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you.:::['2-2-246']
i mean, you're my...:::['2-2-248']
and we're...:::['2-2-249']
oh, i love you! - i love you too!:::['2-2-250']
you guys, um, i know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me.:::['2-2-251']
but, um, i love you guys too!:::['2-2-252']
ugh, i really needed that.:::['2-2-253']
look, i know you're in a place right now......where you really need to hate julie's guts.:::['2-2-254']
but she didn't do anything wrong.:::['2-2-255']
she's just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out.:::['2-2-256']
i think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her.:::['2-2-257']
will you give that a chance?:::['2-2-258']
for me?:::['2-2-259']
i'd do anything for you, you know that.:::['2-2-260']
i'd do anything for you!:::['2-2-261']
wait, wait, wait, wait!:::['2-2-262']
heh. i said, morning.:::['2-2-264']
i heard you.:::['2-2-265']
all right, everybody. i'm opening the doors.:::['2-2-266']
you boys ready?:::['2-2-267']
ready.:::['2-2-268']
yeah, i'm ready.:::['2-2-269']
you idiot! you stupid cowboy!:::['2-2-270']
you've blinded me! i'm suing!:::['2-2-271']
oh, my god! todd! what the hell did you do?:::['2-2-272']
i'm sorry. i'm such a doofus!:::['2-2-273']
i'm so sorry. i'm so sorry.:::['2-2-274']
my god, what happened?:::['2-2-275']
eh, these new kids, they never last.:::['2-2-276']
sooner or later they all......stop lasting.:::['2-2-277']
listen, uh, what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now?:::['2-2-278']
so. - so.:::['2-2-280']
i just thought the two of us should hang out a bit.:::['2-2-281']
i mean, you know, we've never really talked.:::['2-2-282']
i guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us. ha, ha, right?:::['2-2-283']
i know. - mm.:::['2-2-284']
i probably shouldn't even tell you this......but i'm pretty much totally intimidated by you.:::['2-2-285']
oh, my god, are you kidding?:::['2-2-287']
ross is so crazy about you......and i really wanted you to like me, and i...:::['2-2-288']
it's probably me just being totally paranoid......but i kind of got the feeling that maybe you don't.:::['2-2-289']
well......you're not totally paranoid.:::['2-2-290']
god. um... - heh.:::['2-2-292']
when you and, uh, ross first started going out......it was really hard for me, um......for many reasons of which i'm not gonna bore you with now, but, um...:::['2-2-293']
i see how happy he is and how good you guys are together.:::['2-2-294']
and, um, monica's always saying how nice you are......and god, i hate it when she's right.:::['2-2-295']
thanks. - yeah.:::['2-2-296']
listen. would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?:::['2-2-297']
yeah, that'd be great. i'd love it. - yeah?:::['2-2-298']
i'd love it too. okay. - okay.:::['2-2-299']
oh, shoot, i gotta go. - okay.:::['2-2-300']
so i'll talk to you later. - all right, julie.:::['2-2-301']
bye. - bye.:::['2-2-302']
what a manipulative bitch.:::['2-2-303']
it's not bad.:::['2-2-304']
so how was joan? broke up with her.:::['2-3-1']
group: oh, why?:::['2-3-2']
don't tell me. because of the big nostril thing?:::['2-3-3']
they were huge.:::['2-3-4']
when she sneezed, bats flew out of them.:::['2-3-5']
come on, they were not that huge.:::['2-3-6']
i'm telling you, she leaned back, i could see her brain.:::['2-3-7']
how many women will you reject......over the most superficial, insignificant things?:::['2-3-8']
hold it. hold it. i gotta side with chandler on this one.:::['2-3-9']
when i first moved to the city, i went out with this girl.:::['2-3-10']
really hot. great kisser......but she had the biggest adam's apple.:::['2-3-11']
drove me nuts.:::['2-3-12']
you or me? - i got it.:::['2-3-13']
joey, women don't have adam's apples.:::['2-3-14']
heh, heh. you guys are messing with me, right?:::['2-3-15']
group: yeah. we are.:::['2-3-16']
that's a good one. for a second there, i was like, whoa!:::['2-3-17']
friends s02e01: the one where mr. heckles dies:::['2-3-18']
so you name one woman that you broke up with for an actual real reason.:::['2-3-30']
maureen rasillo.:::['2-3-31']
because she doesn't hate yanni is not a real reason.:::['2-3-32']
hello, mr. heckles.:::['2-3-33']
you're stomping. it's disturbing my birds.:::['2-3-36']
you don't have birds.:::['2-3-37']
i could have birds.:::['2-3-38']
okay, we'll try to keep it down. thank you.:::['2-3-39']
i'm going to rejoin my dinner party.:::['2-3-40']
rachel: all right, bye-bye.:::['2-3-41']
chandler: okay, janice. you gotta give me janice. that wasn't about being picky.:::['2-3-42']
ross: we'll give you janice.:::['2-3-43']
i miss janice, though.:::['2-3-44']
hello, chandler bing!:::['2-3-45']
oh, my god! joey: oh, chandler!:::['2-3-46']
now! now!:::['2-3-47']
there! faster!:::['2-3-49']
ugh. stop with the broom! we're not making noise!:::['2-3-50']
rachel: we won.:::['2-3-51']
we won! whoo! - whoo!:::['2-3-52']
mr. heckles.:::['2-3-53']
how did this happen? - he was sweeping.:::['2-3-54']
they found a broom in his hand.:::['2-3-55']
group: oh. rachel: oh, dear god. - that's terrible. - i know.:::['2-3-56']
i was sweeping yesterday.:::['2-3-57']
it could've been me. rachel: yeah.:::['2-3-58']
joey: sure. - sweeping. you never know.:::['2-3-59']
never know.:::['2-3-60']
okay, it's very faint, but i can still sense him in the building.:::['2-3-61']
go into the light, mr. heckles!:::['2-3-62']
chandler: okay, phoebe.:::['2-3-63']
i'm sorry, but sometimes they need help.:::['2-3-64']
joey: yeah. - here we go.:::['2-3-65']
that's fine, go ahead and scoff.:::['2-3-66']
there are a lot of things i don't believe in......but that doesn't mean they're not true.:::['2-3-67']
such as?:::['2-3-68']
like crop circles or the bermuda triangle or evolution.:::['2-3-69']
what, you don't believe in evolution?:::['2-3-71']
no. not really.:::['2-3-72']
you don't believe in evolution?:::['2-3-73']
i don't know. it's just, you know...:::['2-3-74']
monkeys, darwin, it's a nice story. i just think it's a little too easy.:::['2-3-75']
"too easy"? too...:::['2-3-76']
the process of every living thing on this planet evolving......over millions of years from single-celled organisms is "too easy"?:::['2-3-77']
yeah, i just don't buy it.:::['2-3-78']
excuse me. evolution is not for you to buy, phoebe.:::['2-3-79']
evolution is scientific fact, like the air we breathe......like gravity.:::['2-3-80']
okay, don't get me started on gravity.:::['2-3-81']
you, uh...:::['2-3-82']
you don't believe in gravity?:::['2-3-83']
well, it's not so much that, you know, i don't believe in it.:::['2-3-84']
lately i get the feeling that......i'm not so much being pulled down as i am being pushed.:::['2-3-85']
pushed.:::['2-3-86']
uh-oh. it's isaac newton and he's pissed.:::['2-3-87']
there she is. and over there, that's the other one.:::['2-3-88']
this is mr. buddy boyle, heckles' attorney. he'd like to talk to you.:::['2-3-89']
what can we do for you?:::['2-3-90']
all right, kids, here's the deal.:::['2-3-91']
according my client's will......he wants to leave all his earthly possessions......to "the noisy girls in the apartment above mine.":::['2-3-92']
what about his family?:::['2-3-93']
he didn't have any. joey: whoa.:::['2-3-94']
okay, so let's talk money.:::['2-3-95']
all right, there was none.:::['2-3-96']
now, let's talk signing.:::['2-3-97']
you be noisy girl number one. you be noisy girl number two.:::['2-3-98']
i can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us.:::['2-3-99']
isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life......without even knowing it?:::['2-3-100']
would you look at this dump?:::['2-3-101']
he hated us! this was his final revenge!:::['2-3-102']
ever seen so much crap!:::['2-3-103']
actually, i think this apartment sullies the good name of crap.:::['2-3-104']
check this out.:::['2-3-105']
can i have this?:::['2-3-106']
how can you not believe in evolution?:::['2-3-107']
i don't know, just don't. look at this funky shirt!:::['2-3-108']
pheebs, i've studied evolution my entire adult life.:::['2-3-109']
and i can tell you, we've collected fossils from all over the world......that actually show the evolution of different species.:::['2-3-110']
i mean, you can literally see them......evolving through time.:::['2-3-111']
really? you can actually see it?:::['2-3-112']
you bet! in the u.s., china, africa, all over!:::['2-3-113']
see, i didn't know that.:::['2-3-114']
phoebe: huh.:::['2-3-116', '3-19-71']
so now the real question is, who put those fossils there and why?:::['2-3-117']
hey. look at this. my big book of grievances.:::['2-3-118']
hey, there's me.:::['2-3-119']
"april 17th, excessive noise......ltalian guy comes home with a date." yeah.:::['2-3-120']
chandler, you're in here too.:::['2-3-121']
"april 18th, excessive noise......ltalian guy's gay roommate brings home dry cleaning.":::['2-3-122']
well, that's excellent.:::['2-3-123']
monica, look at this lamp.:::['2-3-124']
is this tacky or what? we have to have this.:::['2-3-125']
i think we have enough regular lamps.:::['2-3-126']
what? come on, it's not like......i'm asking for this girlie clock or anything.:::['2-3-127']
which, by the way, i also think is really cool.:::['2-3-128']
look, it doesn't go with any of my stuff.:::['2-3-129']
well, what about my stuff?:::['2-3-130']
you don't have any stuff.:::['2-3-131']
you still think of it as your apartment, don't you?:::['2-3-132']
mmm... no. yes, you do.:::['2-3-133']
you think of it as your apartment and i just rent a room.:::['2-3-134']
mmm...:::['2-3-135']
okay, while you "mmm" on that, i'll go find a place for my new lamp.:::['2-3-136']
okay, pheebs. see how i'm making these little toys move?:::['2-3-137']
opposable thumbs!:::['2-3-138']
without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?:::['2-3-139']
maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.:::['2-3-140']
tell me you're joking.:::['2-3-141']
look, can't we just say that you believe in something and i don't?:::['2-3-142']
no. no, pheebs, we can't. - why not?:::['2-3-143']
what is this obsessive need you have to make everybody agree with you?:::['2-3-144']
no, what's that all about? you know what i think?:::['2-3-145']
i think maybe it's time you put ross under the microscope.:::['2-3-146']
is there blood coming out of my ears?:::['2-3-147']
check it out. heckles' high-school yearbook.:::['2-3-148']
wow. he looks so normal.:::['2-3-149']
he's even kind of cute.:::['2-3-150']
"heckles, you crack me up in science class.:::['2-3-151']
you're the funniest kid in school.":::['2-3-152']
funniest? heckles? - that's what it says.:::['2-3-153']
wow. heckles was voted class clown, and so was i.:::['2-3-154']
he was right. would you listen to that?:::['2-3-155']
i'd call that excessive.:::['2-3-156']
whoa. - what?:::['2-3-157']
heckles played clarinet in band, and i played clarinet.:::['2-3-158']
and he was in the scale modeler's club and i was...:::['2-3-159']
well, there was no club, but i sure thought they were cool.:::['2-3-160']
so? you were both dorks.:::['2-3-161']
big deal.:::['2-3-162']
i just think it's weird, you know? heckles and me...:::['2-3-163']
heckles and me. me...:::['2-3-164']
me and heckles.:::['2-3-165']
hey, would you knock it off!:::['2-3-166']
have you been here all night?:::['2-3-168']
pictures of all the women heckles went out with.:::['2-3-170']
look what he wrote on them. "vivian, too tall.":::['2-3-171']
"madge, big gums.":::['2-3-172']
"too loud.":::['2-3-173']
"too smart." "makes noise when she eats.":::['2-3-174']
this is me.:::['2-3-175']
this is what i do.:::['2-3-176']
i'm gonna end up alone, just like he did.:::['2-3-177']
chandler, heckles was a nut case.:::['2-3-178']
our trains are on the same track.:::['2-3-179']
i'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same.:::['2-3-180']
bitter town......alone-ville, hermit junction!:::['2-3-181']
you know what we gotta do? get you out of here.:::['2-3-182']
come on, i'll buy you breakfast.:::['2-3-183']
what if i never find somebody? or worse, what if i found her......but i dumped her because she pronounces it "supposably"?:::['2-3-184']
chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.:::['2-3-185']
how do you know that? how?:::['2-3-186']
i don't know. i'm just trying to help you out.:::['2-3-187']
you guys will all get married......and i'll end up alone.:::['2-3-188']
will you promise me something?:::['2-3-189']
when you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?:::['2-3-190']
i don't know what we'll be doing.:::['2-3-191']
i mean, what if we're over at her folks' place?:::['2-3-192']
you can come over and watch the super bowl.:::['2-3-194']
every year, all right?:::['2-3-195']
you know what? i'm not gonna end up like this.:::['2-3-196']
i'll see you, man.:::['2-3-197']
"supposably.":::['2-3-199']
supposably.:::['2-3-200', '2-3-202']
did they go to the zoo?:::['2-3-201']
hi. it's me.:::['2-3-203']
janice? you called janice?:::['2-3-205']
yes. janice.:::['2-3-206']
why is that difficult to comprehend?:::['2-3-207']
you remember janice, right?:::['2-3-208']
yes. she was smart, she was pretty and she honestly cared about me.:::['2-3-209']
janice is my last chance to have somebody.:::['2-3-210']
jeez, look how fat she got.:::['2-3-213']
hey, it's everybody. group: hi, janice.:::['2-3-214']
janice, you're...:::['2-3-215']
is it...? - is it yours? ha!:::['2-3-217']
you wish, chandler bing.:::['2-3-218']
you are looking at a married lady now.:::['2-3-219']
aw, sweetie, i'm sorry.:::['2-3-223']
you couldn't tell me on the phone?:::['2-3-224']
and what? miss the expression on your face? oh, no.:::['2-3-225']
janice likes to have her fun.:::['2-3-226']
you know what we haven't played in a while?:::['2-3-227']
what? - hide the lamp.:::['2-3-228']
monica, let it go.:::['2-3-229']
did you know i'm allergic to shellfish?:::['2-3-230']
then you'll just have to eat the other lamps.:::['2-3-231']
uh-oh. it's scary scientist man.:::['2-3-232']
okay, phoebe, this is it.:::['2-3-233']
in this briefcase i carry actual scientific facts.:::['2-3-234']
a briefcase of facts, if you will.:::['2-3-235']
some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.:::['2-3-236']
okay, look, before you even start, i'm not denying evolution.:::['2-3-237']
it's just one of the possibilities.:::['2-3-238']
it's the only possibility.:::['2-3-239']
ross, could you just open your mind, like, this much? okay?:::['2-3-240']
wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believe the earth was flat?:::['2-3-241']
and up till 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing......until you split it open and this whole mess of crap came out.:::['2-3-242']
now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant......that you can't admit that there's a teeny, tiny possibility......that you could be wrong about this?:::['2-3-243']
there might be......a teeny......tiny......possibility.:::['2-3-244']
i can't believe you caved.:::['2-3-245']
what? you just abandoned your whole belief system!:::['2-3-246']
before, i didn't agree with you, but at least i respected you.:::['2-3-247']
how are you gonna go into work tomorrow?:::['2-3-249']
how are you going to face the other science guys?:::['2-3-250']
how are you going to face yourself? oh...:::['2-3-251']
that was fun. so who's hungry? monica: i am.:::['2-3-252']
rachel: me too. let me just get my coat.:::['2-3-253']
what happened? - okay. all right.:::['2-3-254']
it was an accident, i swear.:::['2-3-255']
i was putting on my jacket and the thing and the lamp and it broke.:::['2-3-256']
oh, please, monica! you've always hated my lamp!:::['2-3-257']
and now all of a sudden, it's just magically, it's just broken?:::['2-3-258']
phoebe, tell her?:::['2-3-259']
i didn't see it, because i was putting on my jacket.:::['2-3-260']
but i want to believe you.:::['2-3-261']
hey, chandler. monica just broke my seashell lamp.:::['2-3-262']
neat.:::['2-3-263', '2-22-187']
i'm gonna die alone!:::['2-3-264']
okay, you win.:::['2-3-265']
chandler, you are not gonna die alone.:::['2-3-266']
janice was my safety net, okay?:::['2-3-267']
and now i have to get a snake.:::['2-3-268']
uh-huh. why is that?:::['2-3-269']
if i'm gonna be an old, lonely man, i'm gonna need a thing.:::['2-3-270']
you know, a hook.:::['2-3-271']
like that guy on the subway who eats his own face.:::['2-3-272']
so i figure i'll be "crazy man with a snake.":::['2-3-273']
crazy snake man.:::['2-3-274']
then i'll get more snakes, call them my babies.:::['2-3-275']
kids won't walk past my place, they will run!:::['2-3-276']
"run away from crazy snake man," they'll shout!:::['2-3-277']
you've got to get over this. okay?:::['2-3-278']
you won't end up alone.:::['2-3-279']
of course i am.:::['2-3-280', '5-18-49', '3-21-255']
i reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me......and then i bitch that there aren't any great women out there.:::['2-3-281']
chandler:::['2-3-282']
you have just described......virtually every man that we've ever gone out with.:::['2-3-283']
you are not a freak. you're a guy.:::['2-3-285']
rachel: she's right. you're no different than the rest.:::['2-3-286']
wait a minute. wait a minute. yes, he is.:::['2-3-287']
you are totally different. in a bad way?:::['2-3-288']
no, honey, in a wonderful way.:::['2-3-289']
you know what you want now.:::['2-3-290']
most guys don't even have a clue.:::['2-3-291']
you're ready to take risks, be vulnerable and intimate with someone.:::['2-3-292']
you're not gonna end up alone.:::['2-3-293']
you called janice. that's how much you wanted to be with someone!:::['2-3-294']
you've made it. - you're there.:::['2-3-295']
you are ready to make a commitment!:::['2-3-296']
whoa! don't know about that.:::['2-3-297']
wow. what you got there?:::['2-3-298']
something else that's not yours that you can break?:::['2-3-299']
i know you like this and i want you to have it.:::['2-3-301']
it'll look good in our apartment.:::['2-3-302']
you'll all be pleased to know that i have a date tomorrow night.:::['2-3-306']
this woman allison from work. she is great.:::['2-3-307']
she's pretty, she's smart. and i've been......holding off asking her out in the past, because she has a......unusually large head.:::['2-3-308']
but i'm not going to let that stuff hang me up anymore. all right.:::['2-3-309']
look at me. i'm growing.:::['2-3-310']
hey, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?:::['2-3-311']
i'll take that.:::['2-3-312']
you want his yearbook? - yeah. yeah.:::['2-3-313']
some people said nice things about him. somebody should have it.:::['2-3-314']
gosh, this is so weird.:::['2-3-315']
his whole life was in this apartment and now it's gone.:::['2-3-316']
i think it would be nice if we just took a few moments for mr. heckles.:::['2-3-317']
i mean, he was kind of a pain. he was, but he was a person.:::['2-3-318']
you're all going to hell.:::['2-3-320']
rachel: it's really not that big.:::['2-3-321']
taking that with you, huh? - oh, yeah.:::['2-3-322']
hey, you coming?:::['2-3-323']
yeah, in a second.:::['2-3-324']
allison: my major was useless.:::['2-3-327']
how often do you look in the classifieds and see "philosopher wanted"?:::['2-3-328']
heh, heh. sure.:::['2-3-329']
chandler: my god, that's a big head!:::['2-3-330']
it didn't look this big in the office. maybe it's the lighting.:::['2-3-331']
my head must look like a golf ball at work.:::['2-3-332']
don't get hung up on it. quick, quick. list five things you like about her.:::['2-3-333']
nice smile, good dresser.:::['2-3-334']
big head, big head, big head!:::['2-3-335']
okay. what is it about me? do i not look fun enough?:::['2-7-0']
is there something repellent about me?:::['2-7-1']
how was the party?:::['2-7-2']
it couldn't have been worse. a woman literally passed through me.:::['2-7-3']
so, what is it? am i hideously unattractive?:::['2-7-4']
no, you are not. you are very attractive.:::['2-7-5']
i go through the exact same thing.:::['2-7-6']
every time i put on a little weight, i question everything.:::['2-7-7']
i've put on a little weight?:::['2-7-9']
did you want to? - yeah, uh...:::['2-7-10']
no, not weight. more like insulation.:::['2-7-11']
chandler, i'm unemployed, in dire need of a project.:::['2-7-12']
wanna work out? i can remake you.:::['2-7-13']
uh, i would, but that might get in the way of my lying-around time.:::['2-7-14']
please? - come on, let her do it!:::['2-7-15']
all right. but if we put on spandex......and my boobs are bigger than yours, i'm going home.:::['2-7-16']
your boobs are fine. look, i never should have said anything. come here. come here!:::['2-7-17']
ooh, can't make hands meet!:::['2-7-18']
friends s02e07: the one where ross finds out:::['2-7-19']
okay! let's do it.:::['2-7-31']
nothing. just never seen you in little stretchy pants before.:::['2-7-33']
and we're changing.:::['2-7-34']
unh! - come on, give me five more! - ugh. aah!:::['2-7-35']

it's before work, after work, and during work.:::['2-7-43']
she's got me doing butt-clenches at my desk.:::['2-7-44']
and now they won't bring me my mail anymore.:::['2-7-45']
rachel: hey, pheebs. how'd it go with scott?:::['2-7-46']
oh, um, it was nice. took him to a romantic restaurant......ordered champagne. nice.:::['2-7-47']
the guy still won't put out? - nope. zilch. nothing. uh-uh.:::['2-7-48']
sorry, pheebs. - sorry, pheebs.:::['2-7-49']
well, look, i don't mind taking it slow. i like him a lot.:::['2-7-50']
he's really interesting, and he's really sweet.:::['2-7-51']
why won't he give it up?:::['2-7-52']
maybe he, uh, drives his car on the other side of the road.:::['2-7-53']
if you know what i mean.:::['2-7-54']
no. what do you mean? he's not british.:::['2-7-55']
maybe he's gay. - oh!:::['2-7-56']
um, no, i don't think that's the problem.:::['2-7-57']
we went, um, dancing the other night......and just the way he held me so close and the way he was looking into my eyes......i just definitely felt something.:::['2-7-58']
yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?:::['2-7-59']
no, i felt it on my hip. i could tell.:::['2-7-60']
yo, bing! racquetball in 20 minutes.:::['2-7-61']
joey, be a pal. lift up my hand and smack her with it. heh.:::['2-7-62']
ooh. oh, rachel! don't look. what?:::['2-7-63']
come on, guys. i don't care. i have a date tonight.:::['2-7-64']
whoa, whoa, whoa. you have a date? yeah. monica's setting me up.:::['2-7-65']
heh, now, what about, uh, ross and...:::['2-7-66']
what? my whole insane jealousy thing?:::['2-7-67']
well, you know, as much fun as that was......i've decided to opt for sanity.:::['2-7-68']
so you're okay about all this?:::['2-7-69']
oh, yeah, come on! i'm moving on.:::['2-7-70']
he can press her up against that window as much as he wants.:::['2-7-71']
for all i care, he can throw her through the damn thing.:::['2-7-72']
hi, guys. all: hey.:::['2-7-73']
monica, i figured i'd come by tomorrow and pick up fluffy's old cat toys, okay?:::['2-7-74']
only if you say his full name.:::['2-7-75']
can i come over tomorrow and pick up fluffy meowington's cat toys?:::['2-7-76']
all right. - you're getting a cat?:::['2-7-77']
actually, we're getting a cat. heh.:::['2-7-78']
together? - uh-huh.:::['2-7-79']
both of you? together? ross: yup.:::['2-7-80']
it'll live with ross half the time and me half the time.:::['2-7-81']
oh, well......isn't that just lovely? ha, ha.:::['2-7-82']
that's something the two of you will be able to enjoy......for a really, really, really long time.:::['2-7-83']
hopefully. rachel: oh, wow.:::['2-7-84']
whoa! look at that. i gotta go! i got a date!:::['2-7-85']
with a man. ahem, okay.:::['2-7-86']
you guys have a really, uh, good night......and you two have a, uh, really good cat. heh.:::['2-7-87']
we're not supposed to take these when we leave.:::['2-7-88']
i don't know if monica told you... ...but this the first date i've gone on since my divorce.:::['2-7-89']
so if i seem a little nervous... ...i am.:::['2-7-90']
how long do cats live?:::['2-7-91']
i'm sorry? - cats. how long do they live?:::['2-7-92']
figuring you don't throw them under a bus or something?:::['2-7-93']
um, maybe 15, 16 years. well, that's just great.:::['2-7-94']
um, cheers. - mm.:::['2-7-95']
right. clink. heh.:::['2-7-96']
monica told you i was cuter than this, didn't she?:::['2-7-97']
oh, no, michael, it's not you.:::['2-7-98']
sorry. it's just... it's this thing.:::['2-7-99']
it's probably not as bad as it sounds......but this friend of mine is getting a cat with his girlfriend.:::['2-7-100']
oh, that does sound...:::['2-7-101']
huh. - he just started going out with her.:::['2-7-102']
ahem. is this guy, uh, an old boyfriend?:::['2-7-103']
yeah, he wishes.:::['2-7-104']
oh, i'm sorry. look at me.:::['2-7-105']
okay, michael, let's talk about you.:::['2-7-106']
all right. - okay. okay?:::['2-7-107']
did you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?:::['2-7-109']
so i figured it out. - what?:::['2-7-110']
why scott doesn't want to sleep with me.:::['2-7-111']
'cause i'm not sexy enough.:::['2-7-112']
heh, phoebe, that's crazy.:::['2-7-113']
when i first met you, you know what i said to chandler?:::['2-7-114']
mm-mm. - i said, "excellent butt, great rack.":::['2-7-115']
really? that's so sweet.:::['2-7-116']
i mean, i'm officially offended. but that's so sweet.:::['2-7-117']
look, if you wanna know what the deal is, you're gonna have to ask him.:::['2-7-118']
you're right. you're right.:::['2-7-119']
ugh, you are so yum!:::['2-7-120']
i mean, it's a cat, you know? it's a cat.:::['2-7-121']
why can't they get one of those bugs? one of those fruit flies.:::['2-7-122']
those things that live for a day. what are they called? what are they called?:::['2-7-123']
fruit flies? - yes!:::['2-7-124']
thank you. - would you like any dessert?:::['2-7-125']
no! no dessert.:::['2-7-126']
just the check. please.:::['2-7-127']
oh, no. you're not having fun, are you?:::['2-7-128']
no, no, i am.:::['2-7-129']
but only because i've been playing the movie diner in my head.:::['2-7-130']
oh, look at me.:::['2-7-131']
look at me.:::['2-7-132', '5-11-254']
oh, i'm on a date with a really great guy.:::['2-7-133']
all i can think about is ross... ...and his cat......and his julie.:::['2-7-134']
i just want to get over him. god, why can't i do that?:::['2-7-135']
oy.:::['2-7-136', '3-25-70']
look, i've been through a divorce. trust me, you're gonna be fine.:::['2-7-137']
you can't see it because you haven't had closure...:::['2-7-138']
closure!:::['2-7-140']
that's what it is. that's what i need.:::['2-7-141']
god, you're brilliant!:::['2-7-142']
why didn't i think of that? how do i get that?:::['2-7-143']
well, there's no one way really, it's just...:::['2-7-144']
whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him::::['2-7-145']
"i'm over you.":::['2-7-146']
over you.:::['2-7-147']
that's what it is.:::['2-7-148']
closure.:::['2-7-149']

and you see there, i'm thinking of names......so obviously i am over you.:::['2-7-167']
i am over you.:::['2-7-168', '4-21-210']
and that, my friend, is what they call "closure.":::['2-7-169']
no, no, no, no, no, no.:::['2-7-170', '3-18-122']
monica, it's sunday morning. i'm not running on a sunday.:::['2-7-172']

well, basically......ahem, lately, i've, uh...:::['2-7-211']
ahem, i've sort of had feelings for you.:::['2-7-212']
you've had feelings for me?:::['2-7-213']
yeah, so? you had feelings for me first. whoa, huh.:::['2-7-214']
you know about my...? you know i had...?:::['2-7-215']
chandler told me. - when did he...? when did he...? when did he?:::['2-7-217']
when you were in china. - china.:::['2-7-218']
meeting julie. - julie.:::['2-7-219']
julie. that's... oh, god.:::['2-7-220']
julie? julie, right.:::['2-7-221']
okay, i need to lie down.:::['2-7-222', '4-21-220']
no, i'm gonna stand. i'm gonna stand... - okay.:::['2-7-223']
...and i'm gonna walk. i'm walking and i am standing.:::['2-7-224']
okay, so you, uh?:::['2-7-225']
and now, what? now...? now.:::['2-7-226']
now you're over me?:::['2-7-227']
are you over me?:::['2-7-228']
that's... that's julie. that's julie. julie.:::['2-7-229']
hi, julie. julie: honey, i've got a cab waiting.:::['2-7-230']
i'll be right down!:::['2-7-231']
wait, so you're going?:::['2-7-232']
well, okay, i, uh... i have to. i can't deal with this right now.:::['2-7-233']
i mean, i've, uh... heh. you know, i've got a cab. i've got a girlfriend.:::['2-7-234']
i'm gonna go get a cat.:::['2-7-235']
cat!:::['2-7-237']
hey, joey. - hey, pheebs.:::['2-7-238']
how come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?:::['2-7-239']
i can't find the remote.:::['2-7-240']
ugh, thank you. heh.:::['2-7-241']
so, scott asked me to come over for lunch and i did.:::['2-7-242']
and? - and we did.:::['2-7-243']
all right, pheebs! way to go! - yay, me. ha, ha.:::['2-7-244']
so how did it happen?:::['2-7-245']
i finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.:::['2-7-246']
what did he say? - he said that......he understands how sex can be a very emotional thing for a woman.:::['2-7-247']
and he was just afraid that i was going to get all, you know::::['2-7-248']
"is he gonna call me the next day?" and "where is this going?" and::::['2-7-249']
so he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be serious.:::['2-7-250']
yeah. so i said,"okay. relax, please." you know?:::['2-7-251']
i mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment.:::['2-7-252']
if he wants to see me again, he can call. if not, that's fine too.:::['2-7-253']
so after a lot of talking, heh......i convinced him. heh!:::['2-7-254']
let me get this straight. he got you to beg to sleep with him.:::['2-7-255']
he got you to say he never has to call you again.:::['2-7-256']
and he got you thinking this is a great idea?:::['2-7-257']
this man is my god.:::['2-7-259']
hi. - i didn't get a cat.:::['2-7-261']
oh, that's, um, interesting.:::['2-7-262']
no. no, it's not interesting. okay? it's very, very not interesting.:::['2-7-263']
it's actually a hundred percent the opposite of interesting.:::['2-7-264']
i got it, ross.:::['2-7-265']
you had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.:::['2-7-266', '4-21-88']
what? - i was doing great with julie before i found out about you.:::['2-7-267']
i was doing great before i found out about you!:::['2-7-268']
you think it's easy for me to see you with julie?:::['2-7-269', '4-21-91']
you should've said something before i met her.:::['2-7-270']
i didn't know then. and how come you never said anything to me?:::['2-7-271']
there was never a good time.:::['2-7-272']
you only had a year. and we only hung out every night!:::['2-7-273']
not... not... not......every night.:::['2-7-274']
it's not like i didn't try. but things got in the way.:::['2-7-275']
you know, like italian guys... ...or ex-fiancés, or... or... or...:::['2-7-276']
italian guys.:::['2-7-277']
there was one italian guy, okay? and do you have a point?:::['2-7-278']
the point is, i don't need this right now!:::['2-7-279']
okay? it's too late.:::['2-7-280']
i'm with somebody else. i'm happy. this ship has sailed!:::['2-7-281']
you're just gonna put away feelings or whatever it was you felt for me?:::['2-7-282']
i've done it since ninth grade. i've gotten good at it.:::['2-7-283']
all right, fine. you go ahead and do that, ross.:::['2-7-284']
i don't need your stupid ship!:::['2-7-285']
good. - good!:::['2-7-286']
and you know what? now i got closure!:::['2-7-287']
try the bottom one.:::['2-7-288']
monica, it's 6:30 in the morning.:::['2-7-289']
we're not working out. it's over.:::['2-7-290']
no way! with one pound to go? come on!:::['2-7-291']
we're workin', we're movin' we're in the zone, we're groovin':::['2-7-292']
okay, i don't mind the last pound.:::['2-7-293']
in fact, i kind of like the last pound.:::['2-7-294']
so don't make me do anything that i'll regret.:::['2-7-295']
ha, oh, what you gonna do, fat boy, huh? ha, ha.:::['2-7-296']
nothing. except tell you, uh, it's wonderful how much energy you have.:::['2-7-298']
especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.:::['2-7-300']
well, you know. heh.:::['2-7-301']
you know, i mean......you can't tell your parents you were fired, because they'd be disappointed.:::['2-7-302']
it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.:::['2-7-304']
well, no. but i... - i mean......if it were me, i'd have difficulty getting out of bed at all.:::['2-7-305']
you know, i try to stay positive.:::['2-7-306']
so you?:::['2-7-307']
you feel like going for a run?:::['2-7-308']
because you don't have to. you could just take a nap right here.:::['2-7-310']
just for a little while. - okay.:::['2-7-312']
okay, chandler, mon, there's only one banana-nut muffin left.:::['2-23-0']
i ordered mine first.:::['2-23-1']
yeah, but i'm so much faster.:::['2-23-2']
give it to me.:::['2-23-3', '2-23-5']
okay, you can have it.:::['2-23-6']
there you go. enjoy your coffee.:::['2-23-7']
that was there when i got here.:::['2-23-8']
hey, you guys, you will never guess who's coming to new york.:::['2-23-9']
quick, phoebe, tell us before he swallows.:::['2-23-10']
ryan, that guy i went out with who's in the navy.:::['2-23-11']
you went out with a guy in the navy?:::['2-23-12']
yeah, i met him while playing guitar in the park.:::['2-23-13']
ryan threw in saltwater taffy because he didn't have change.:::['2-23-14']
hey, is that when you wrote "saltwater taffy man"?:::['2-23-15']
no. heh.:::['2-23-16']
no, he's my submarine guy. he resurfaces, like, every couple years......and we have the most amazing three days together.:::['2-23-17']
only this time, he's coming for two weeks. two whole weeks, which means "yay.":::['2-23-18']
so wait, this guy goes down for, like, two years at a time?:::['2-23-19']
that'll teach you to lick my muffin.:::['2-23-20']
oh, no. what happened?:::['2-23-22']
i just spoke to carol. ben's got chicken pox.:::['2-23-23']
group: oh, no. you're kidding.:::['2-23-24']
yeah, so if you haven't had it, chances are you're gonna get it.:::['2-23-25']
well, i've had it. - yeah, i've had it.:::['2-23-26']
had it. - had it.:::['2-23-27']
i've never had it. i feel so left out. oh, look.:::['2-23-28']
friends s02e23: the one with the chicken pox:::['2-23-29']
honey, you made the bed again.:::['2-23-41']
i told you, you don't have to do that. this isn't camp.:::['2-23-42']
oh. then i guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for.:::['2-23-43']
okay, i am going to take a shower.:::['2-23-44']
and today i will be singing jim croce's "leroy brown.":::['2-23-45']
hey, mon, i have a question.:::['2-23-47']
is leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town......or the fattest man in the whole damn town?:::['2-23-48']
the baddest. otherwise, the song would be "fat, fat leroy brown.":::['2-23-49']
i'm just waiting for you, sweetie.:::['2-23-51']
are you remaking the bed?:::['2-23-52']
i'm sorry, i'm sorry. you know what? the way you did it, it was just fine.:::['2-23-53']
then you're redoing it because?:::['2-23-54']
if i tell you, you'll think i'm crazy.:::['2-23-55']
you're pretty much running that risk either way.:::['2-23-56']
okay. you see......the duvet tag shouldn't be at the top left corner......it should be at the bottom right corner.:::['2-23-57']
uh-huh. well, that's not so crazy. - i'm just easing you in.:::['2-23-58']
ha. all right.:::['2-23-59']
all right, you see these little flower blossoms?:::['2-23-60']
they should be facing up, not down......because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be.:::['2-23-61']
you don't love me anymore, do you?:::['2-23-62']
actually, if it's possible, i love you more.:::['2-23-63']
wow. well, then, come on.:::['2-23-65']
i wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point.:::['2-23-66']
joey, if you need something to hold you over......i can get you a job right here as an entry-level processor.:::['2-23-67']
don't you need experience for a job like that?:::['2-23-68']
it's not that hard to learn.:::['2-23-69']
and as for people realizing you don't know what you're doing, hey, you're an actor.:::['2-23-70']
act like a processor, people will think you're a processor.:::['2-23-71']
hey, chandler. here's this morning's projections.:::['2-23-72']
hey, thanks. scott alexander, joey tribbiani.:::['2-23-73']
hey scott: hey.:::['2-23-74']
joey is a, uh, fellow processor.:::['2-23-75']
no kidding?:::['2-23-76', '3-11-123']
i process. people want the processing, i'm the one they call.:::['2-23-78']
where do you work? - uh, well, right now i'm in between things.:::['2-23-79']
you know how it is. one day you're processing, the next day......you're not so much processing anymore.:::['2-23-80']
i was telling joey about the opening in fleischman's group.:::['2-23-81']
fleischman's group.:::['2-23-82']
whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches.:::['2-23-83']
are all you processors dorks?:::['2-23-84']
ugh. this lipstick looks just great on you.:::['2-23-85']

yeah, are you sure? really?:::['2-23-87']
see, you look beautiful. for god sakes, dim the lights.:::['2-23-88']
i'm hideous.:::['2-23-89']
ryan's been underwater.:::['2-23-91']

phoebe: come in.:::['2-23-93']

phoebe: hey, ryan. what's up?:::['2-23-95']
phoebe: no, no. you have to stay back. i have the pox.:::['2-23-97']
chicken or small?:::['2-23-98']
phoebe: chicken, which is so ironic considering i'm a vegetarian.:::['2-23-99']
why aren't you at home in bed? - my grandmother's never had chicken pox.:::['2-23-100']
please, please, tell me you have......because oh, my god, i forgot how cute you are.:::['2-23-101']
i'm sorry, i never had them. - oh, oh!:::['2-23-102']
if i had one wish, it'd be to build a time machine, go back to when i was 7......when jimmy hauser had chicken pox......i would grab that kid and rub him all over my face.:::['2-23-103']
phoebe: yeah, or, you know, you could just wish that i didn't have them now.:::['2-23-104']
can i please see your face?:::['2-23-105']
no. you don't wanna see a face covered with pox.:::['2-23-106']
your face could be covered with lox, i wouldn't care.:::['2-23-107']
phoebe: and you hate fish. oh.:::['2-23-108']
so sweet. all right.:::['2-23-109']
okay, all right. you can see.:::['2-23-110']
this, ahem, is me.:::['2-23-111']
i am scary.:::['2-23-113']
sorry, the lightning...:::['2-23-114']
lightning was an unfortunate coincidence.:::['2-23-115']
you look lovely. lovely.:::['2-23-116']
i hate this.:::['2-23-117']
i tell you, i had the most amazing two weeks planned for us.:::['2-23-118']
and almost everything i had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this.:::['2-23-119']
phoebe, i've spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men......thinking about this moment.:::['2-23-120']
i am not gonna let a bunch......of itchy spots stand between us.:::['2-23-121']
okay. this is the most romantic disease i've ever had.:::['2-23-122']
hey. - hey. how's the first day going?:::['2-23-123']
pretty good. it's like you said.:::['2-23-124']
it's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.:::['2-23-125']
hey, and everybody's so nice.:::['2-23-127']
i just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, jeannie.:::['2-23-128']
jeannie? the head of east coast operations, jeannie?:::['2-23-129']
yeah. turns out our kids go to the same school.:::['2-23-130']
yeah. small world, huh? ha, ha.:::['2-23-131']
weird world.:::['2-23-132']
your kids? - i figure my character has kids.:::['2-23-133']
you know, there isn't a part of that sentence that i don't need explained.:::['2-23-134']
well, see, when you're acting, you need to think about stuff like that.:::['2-23-135']
my character, joseph the processing guy......has two little girls, ashley and brittany.:::['2-23-136']
ashley copies everything brittany does.:::['2-23-137']
oh. well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes.:::['2-23-138']
yeah, yeah. you know, joseph and his wife, karen, are thinking of having a third kid.:::['2-23-139']
just did.:::['2-23-141']
really, wow. that's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.:::['2-23-142']
you know what makes the itching even worse?:::['2-23-143']
that you don't stop talking about it?:::['2-23-144']
fine. - let's just play, okay?:::['2-23-145']
good, okay.:::['2-23-146']
here we go, double sixes.:::['2-23-147']

you're scratching.:::['2-23-153']
give me the dice. - no.:::['2-23-154']

look, double sixes.:::['2-23-156']
we can't scratch. you know we can't. we'll scar.:::['2-23-157']
i can't stop thinking about it. it's just so hard.:::['2-23-158']
i just wanna grab these houses and rub them all over my body.:::['2-23-159']
no. no. - give it.:::['2-23-160']
you know you want it. you know you want it too. come on.:::['2-23-162']
let's just be bad. it'll feel so good.:::['2-23-163']

aah! stop that. stop that right now.:::['2-23-172']
you know, i might've expected this of you, phoebe.:::['2-23-173']
but, ryan, you're a military man.:::['2-23-174']
you and milton have to join us on the boat.:::['2-23-175']
karen will pack a lunch, you bring the kids. we'll make a day of it.:::['2-23-176']
oh, that sounds lovely. we're gonna have to set that up.:::['2-23-177']
oh, i better get back. hope the baby feels better.:::['2-23-178']
oh, thanks. thanks.:::['2-23-179']
bye-bye, jeannie. ha, ha. jeannie: bye-bye, joseph.:::['2-23-180']
what a phony.:::['2-23-181']
well, i'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing.:::['2-23-182']
hey, mr. douglas. - sir.:::['2-23-183']
uh, listen, bing, i got your memo.:::['2-23-184']
so we're not gonna see the report until next friday?:::['2-23-185']
well, the people in my group want to spend the holiday with family.:::['2-23-186']
i have a family. i'm gonna be here.:::['2-23-187']
yeah, bing. what's that about?:::['2-23-188']
it's about cutting my people a little slack, you know, for morale.:::['2-23-189']
if you wanna see some rough numbers, i can get them to you by wednesday.:::['2-23-190']
rough numbers?:::['2-23-191']
this company was not built on rough numbers. right, mr. douglas?:::['2-23-192']
have the final numbers on my desk by tuesday.:::['2-23-193']
if you say so, sir.:::['2-23-194']
joseph's good, isn't he?:::['2-23-195']
well, i'm going to kill you.:::['2-23-196']
hey, hey, i just figured joseph's the kind of guy who likes to mix it up.:::['2-23-197']
you know, get in there, ruffle some feathers.:::['2-23-198']
look, i'm sorry, but that's what joseph does.:::['2-23-200']
okay? if you try to pull something......he'll call you on it.:::['2-23-201']
"what are you trying to pull?" he'll say.:::['2-23-202']
ooh. duct tape.:::['2-23-203']
was i supposed to bring something too?:::['2-23-204']
this is for the scratchy twins out there. i taped oven mitts to their hands.:::['2-23-205']
you're strict.:::['2-23-206']
yeah, well, it's for their own good.:::['2-23-207']
you know, i like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under.:::['2-23-208']
see, in a tape emergency, you could shave valuable seconds off your time.:::['2-23-209']
exactly. oh.:::['2-23-210']
god, i love that i can be totally neurotic around you now.:::['2-23-211']
tell me the truth. - hmm.:::['2-23-212']
don't you like it better that everything on your desk is perpendicular?:::['2-23-213']
if it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle.:::['2-23-214']
very good. - thank you.:::['2-23-215']
you know what? tomorrow, i'm gonna do your clocks.:::['2-23-216']
you're gonna do what to my clocks?:::['2-23-217']
i'm gonna set them to my time.:::['2-23-218']
well, i'm confused.:::['2-23-219']
i thought we shared time.:::['2-23-220']
no, no. see, in my bedroom i set my clock six minutes fast.:::['2-23-221']
you wanna know why?:::['2-23-222']
because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen?:::['2-23-223']
you know what? forget it. - no, come on, come on, tell me.:::['2-23-224']
no, you don't understand. - no, come on.:::['2-23-225']
no, you don't have any of these cute obsessive things.:::['2-23-226']
no, that's not true. that is not true.:::['2-23-227']
oh, yeah? - yeah.:::['2-23-228']
all right, well, tell me one of yours.:::['2-23-229']
one of my things is, i always separate my sweat socks......from my dress socks.:::['2-23-232']
yeah. - what if they get mixed up?:::['2-23-233']
boy, i would just, uh...:::['2-23-234']
i would freak out.:::['2-23-235']
you would not.:::['2-23-236']
i can't believe this. i hate this. you're too normal.:::['2-23-237']
i can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.:::['2-23-238']
my boyfriend doesn't have a thing.:::['2-23-239']
see, if anyone overheard that, i didn't come off well there.:::['2-23-240']
joey: hey.:::['2-23-241', '5-15-185', '4-5-190']
mr. douglas is looking for you. - why? why is mr. douglas looking for me?:::['2-23-242']
because he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the lender project.:::['2-23-243']
why? why does he suspect that?:::['2-23-244']
because at first, he thought it was joseph......but after he asked joseph about it, turns out it was you.:::['2-23-245']
anyway, i just thought you should know. - all right. that's it.:::['2-23-246']
look, joey......l'm sorry, i realize this is the role of a lifetime for you......and if i could just fire joseph, i would.:::['2-23-247']
but unfortunately that's not possible.:::['2-23-248']
so i'm gonna have to let both of you go.:::['2-23-249']
what are you talking about? everybody loves joseph.:::['2-23-250']
i don't. i hate joseph.:::['2-23-251']
okay, i think he's a brown-nosing suck-up.:::['2-23-252']
well, you can't fire joseph. you know why?:::['2-23-254']
he's not in your department.:::['2-23-255']
all right, okay. all right, so i can't fire joseph......but, uh, i can sleep with his wife.:::['2-23-256']
not karen. - yeah, karen.:::['2-23-257']
i'm thinking about having an affair with her. oh, you know what?:::['2-23-258']
i just did.:::['2-23-259']
what the hell are you doing to me, man?:::['2-23-260']
oh, it's not me.:::['2-23-261']
it's my character.:::['2-23-262']
chandie.:::['2-23-263']
yeah, the rogue processor who seduces his coworkers' wives for sport......and then laughs about it the next day.:::['2-23-264']
in fact, i have her panties right there in my drawer.:::['2-23-265']
really? - no, freak show, she's fictional!:::['2-23-266']
come on! hey. take it easy.:::['2-23-267']
if it means that much to you, i'll, uh... i'll go find something else.:::['2-23-268']
it's just that i'm gonna miss joseph.:::['2-23-270']
i liked him. his wife.:::['2-23-271']
she was hot.:::['2-23-272']
please take these off. i swear i won't scratch.:::['2-23-274']
no, sorry, hon. monica's orders.:::['2-23-275']
well, that wasn't easy.:::['2-23-276']
okay, dinner's on.:::['2-23-277']
and there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven.:::['2-23-278']
so the plate's gonna be hot, but that shouldn't be a problem for you.:::['2-23-279']
all right, you kids. bye, now.:::['2-23-280']
bye. ross: oh, look, look.:::['2-23-281']
a low-budget puppet show.:::['2-23-282']
it's such a shame you can't see what finger i'm holding up.:::['2-23-283']
wine? - please.:::['2-23-285']
oh. spilled some. - i got it.:::['2-23-286']
i must tell you, you look beautiful tonight.:::['2-23-287']
you know what? that's it. that's it.:::['2-23-292']
oh! oh!:::['2-23-293', '5-5-289', '4-11-118', '4-6-244']
oh, yes. - oh.:::['2-23-294']
you guys, did you...?:::['2-23-296']
monica, wake up.:::['2-23-297']
monica. - what's up?:::['2-23-298']
i thought of a thing.:::['2-23-299']
i have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed.:::['2-23-301']
no, honey. you have to sleep on this side of the bed......because i have to sleep on this side of the bed.:::['2-23-302']
or so i would have you believe.:::['2-23-303']
no. big deal. so you have a side of the bed. everybody has a side of the bed.:::['2-23-304']
hey, come on. you haven't heard my reason yet.:::['2-23-305']
all right, go on. - okay.:::['2-23-306']
i have to sleep on the west side......because i grew up in california......and otherwise......the ocean would be on the wrong side.:::['2-23-307']
oh, my god. you're a freak. - yeah.:::['2-23-308']
how about that?:::['2-23-309']
so, ryan, where are you shipping off to? - i really can't say.:::['2-23-310']
so do you have any nuclear weapons onboard?:::['2-23-311']
well, do you get to look through one of those periscope thingies?:::['2-23-313']
i'm sorry, but i can't say.:::['2-23-314']
wow, it's neat learning about submarines.:::['2-23-315']
i better get out of here. i'm gonna miss my flight.:::['2-23-316']
okay, i'll walk you out.:::['2-23-317']
ross: bye, ryan. - pleasure. take care.:::['2-23-318']
so do you, uh, think we could get you one of those uniform things?:::['2-23-319']
you like that, do you?:::['2-23-320']
oh, yeah. - i'll make some calls.:::['2-23-321']
can you believe that's how we spent our two weeks?:::['2-23-323']
we didn't do the romantic things i'd planned......like having a picnic in central park and, you know, a coffee at central perk.:::['2-23-324']
oh, i just got that.:::['2-23-325']
taxi.:::['2-23-326']
bye, you.:::['2-23-327']
i'm sorry, we're clo...:::['2-23-328']
hey, sailor.:::['2-23-329']
is this what you had in mind?:::['2-23-330']
ha, ha. i'll say.:::['2-23-331']
i'm shipping out tomorrow.:::['2-23-332']
well, then, uh......we better make this night count.:::['2-23-333']
oh, wait, i forgot to turn off the cappuccino machine.:::['2-23-334']
anchors aweigh.:::['2-23-335']
oh, wait. my purse, my purse, my purse.:::['2-23-336']
oh, you know what? i forgot to turn off the bathroom light.:::['2-23-337']
all right, why don't i just meet you upstairs?:::['2-23-338']
rachel: honey.:::['2-23-339']
so i'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth.:::['2-22-0']
since it's rachel's birthday and we want it to be special......i thought i'd poach a salmon. group: oh.:::['2-22-1']
question: why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?:::['2-22-3']
you wanna be in charge of the food committee?:::['2-22-4']
question two: why do we always have parties with committees?:::['2-22-5']
yeah, yeah. why can't we just get some pizzas......and gets some beers and have fun? - yeah.:::['2-22-6']
yeah, i agree. you know, i think fancy parties are only fun......if you're fancy on the inside, and i'm just not sure we are.:::['2-22-7']
all right. you guys don't want it to be special?:::['2-22-8']
fine. you can throw any kind of party you want.:::['2-22-9']
joey, they're not real. - huh? huh.:::['2-22-10']
i start miles beneath the surface of these things, okay? they're fake.:::['2-22-11']
see? honk, honk.:::['2-22-12']
wow, it's like porno for clowns.:::['2-22-13']
friends s02e22: the one with the two parties:::['2-22-14']
i talked to rachel's sisters. neither of them can come.:::['2-22-26']
okay, so i still have to invite dylan and emma and shannon cooper.:::['2-22-27']
whoa, whoa, whoa. uh, no shannon cooper.:::['2-22-28']
why not her?:::['2-22-29']
because she, uh... she steals stuff.:::['2-22-30']
or maybe she doesn't steal stuff......and joey slept with her and never called her back.:::['2-22-31']
joey, that is horrible. - hey, i liked her.:::['2-22-32']
all right? maybe too much. i don't know.:::['2-22-33']
i guess i just got scared.:::['2-22-34']
i'm sorry. i didn't know.:::['2-22-35']
heh. i didn't think anyone would buy that. okay.:::['2-22-36']
hi, honey. how did it go? - ugh. it was the graduation from hell.:::['2-22-37']
you know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship.:::['2-22-38']
you know, i mean, this is supposed to be a joyous occasion.:::['2-22-39']
my sister's graduating from college. nobody thought she would.:::['2-22-40']
it's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a celica.:::['2-22-41']
so, what happened? - my parents happened.:::['2-22-42']
all they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly......and not talk about the divorce. but no.:::['2-22-43']
they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address.:::['2-22-44']
bishop tutu actually had to stop and shush them.:::['2-22-45']
ugh. but you know what? you know what the good news is?:::['2-22-46']
i get to serve coffee for the next eight hours.:::['2-22-47']
okay, so i guess we don't invite her parents.:::['2-22-48']
well, how about just her mom? - why her mom?:::['2-22-49']
because i already invited her.:::['2-22-50']
ooh, did you ask stacy roth?:::['2-22-51']
uh, can't invite her.:::['2-22-52']
she also steals.:::['2-22-53']
okay, here are the candles. where's the birthday cake?:::['2-22-54']
okay, we're not having birthday cake. we're having birthday flan.:::['2-22-55']
it's a traditional mexican custard dessert.:::['2-22-57']
whoa, that's nice.:::['2-22-58']
happy birthday, rachel. here's some goo.:::['2-22-59']
monica: dr. green.:::['2-22-60']
oh, my god. it's rachel's dad.:::['2-22-61']
what, the father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?:::['2-22-63']
no, no, the father can.:::['2-22-64']
but, um, since i am the roommate, i can tell you that she's not here.:::['2-22-65']
and i'll pass along the message. okay? so bye-bye.:::['2-22-66']
oh. you're having a party.:::['2-22-67']
no, no, not a party.:::['2-22-68']
just a surprise gathering of some people rachel knows.:::['2-22-69']
uh, this is phoebe and chandler and joey. - i'll never remember all of that.:::['2-22-70']
so, uh, what's the deal?:::['2-22-71']
rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff? is that it?:::['2-22-72']
this isn't your first surprise party, is it, sir?:::['2-22-73']
hi, monica.:::['2-22-74']
the chinese menu guy. forgot the menus.:::['2-22-75']
so basically, just a chinese guy.:::['2-22-76']
hey, dr. green, come with me. we'll put your jacket on rachel's bed.:::['2-22-77']
all right. that sounds like a two-person job.:::['2-22-78']
well, my goodness. what was that?:::['2-22-79']
sandra, i am so sorry. i thought you were rachel.:::['2-22-80']
and we weren't ready for you yet.:::['2-22-81']
you thought i was rachel? - yes, because, uh, you look so young.:::['2-22-82']
and because you're both, you know, white women.:::['2-22-83']
oh, i missed you kids.:::['2-22-84']
well, should i put my coat in the bedroom?:::['2-22-85']
no, i'll take that for you. - oh, well, thank you.:::['2-22-87']

okay, do you have any ideas for any openers?:::['2-22-160']
uh, let's just stay clear of "i'm the guy that's doing your daughter"......and you should be okay.:::['2-22-161']
okay, people, i want you to take a piece of paper...:::['2-22-162']
here you go. and write down your most embarrassing memory.:::['2-22-163']
and i do ask that when you're not using the markers......you put the caps back on them......because they will dry out.:::['2-22-164']
hi, dr. green.:::['2-22-165']
so how's everything in the, uh......vascular surgery game?:::['2-22-166']
it's not a game, ross. a woman died on my table today.:::['2-22-167']
see, that's the good thing about my job.:::['2-22-169']
all the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.:::['2-22-170']
listen, you guys, um, i don't mean to be a pain about this......but, um, i've noticed that some of you are just placing them on.:::['2-22-171']
you want to push the caps......until you hear them click.:::['2-22-172']
gunther. where you going?:::['2-22-173']
i, uh, was sort of thinking about maybe...:::['2-22-174']

come on, come on, we're just getting started. here's your marker.:::['2-22-176']
listen, if you want to go, just go.:::['2-22-177']
no. she'll yell at me again.:::['2-22-178']
all right, ahem, i can get you out.:::['2-22-179']
in a minute, i'm gonna create a diversion.:::['2-22-182']
when i do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back.:::['2-22-183']
i think i need a drink. - oh, i'll get it for you.:::['2-22-184']
what do you want? - scotch.:::['2-22-185']
all right, i'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass.:::['2-22-186']
cool. green: no, no, no.:::['2-22-188']

oh. huh.:::['2-22-196', '5-13-254']
mine too. isn't that neat?:::['2-22-197']
scotch neat.:::['2-22-198']
would you excuse me?:::['2-22-199']
where are you sneaking off to, mister? heh.:::['2-22-201']
i'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.:::['2-22-202']
no. - no. what do you mean "no"?:::['2-22-203']
no, um, see, because that's the staging area.:::['2-22-204']
you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party.:::['2-22-205']
yeah, i think, you take your scotch back in there......and i will get your cigarettes for you, sir.:::['2-22-206']
and get my glasses too. - all righty-roo.:::['2-22-207']
what a great moment to say that for the first time.:::['2-22-208']
okay, the first person's most embarrassing memory is::::['2-22-209']
"monica, your party sucks.":::['2-22-210']
all right. very funny.:::['2-22-211']
phoebe: oh, no. ooh. did someone forget to use a coaster?:::['2-22-212']
i don't see anything.:::['2-22-214']
great, i'm seeing water rings again.:::['2-22-215']
ross, whose glasses are those?:::['2-22-216']
mine.:::['2-22-217']
you wear bifocals?:::['2-22-218']
i have a condition apparently......that i require......two different sets of focals.:::['2-22-220']
do you know my husband has glasses just like that?:::['2-22-221']
oh. - well, those are very popular frames.:::['2-22-222']
neil sedaka wears them.:::['2-22-223']
i hear you can get people out of here.:::['2-22-224']
rachel? - yeah?:::['2-22-225']
you didn't tell me your boyfriend smokes.:::['2-22-226']
yeah, like a chimney.:::['2-22-227']
big smoker.:::['2-22-228']
big, big smoker.:::['2-22-229']
in fact, i'm gonna go out into the hallway and fire up this bad boy.:::['2-22-230']
are you wearing my glasses?:::['2-22-231']
i was just warming up the earpieces for you.:::['2-22-233']
is that one of my cigarettes?:::['2-22-235']
yes, it is. i was just moistening the tip.:::['2-22-237']
okay, okay. she's taking the trash out, so i can get you out of here.:::['2-22-238']
but it has to be now. she'll be back any minute.:::['2-22-239']
what about my friend victor?:::['2-22-240']
no, only the three of you. any more than that and she'll get suspicious.:::['2-22-241']
all right. let me just get my coat. - there isn't time.:::['2-22-242']
just leave everything.:::['2-22-243']
they'll take care of you next door.:::['2-22-244']
is it true they have beer?:::['2-22-245']
everything you've heard is true.:::['2-22-246']
could you guys please try and keep it down?:::['2-22-247']
we're trying to start a boggle tournament.:::['2-22-248']
you. and you.:::['2-22-249']
you're supposed to be at my party. and gunther.:::['2-22-250']
hey, welcome to the fo...:::['2-22-253']
all right, i'm sorry. but these people needed me.:::['2-22-255']
you know, they work hard all week. it's saturday night.:::['2-22-256']
they deserve to have a little fun. go.:::['2-22-257']
you know, my party is fun.:::['2-22-258']
i mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sort of fun.:::['2-22-259']
but, you know, if people would just give it a chance, it's...:::['2-22-260']
you want me to see a therapist? - sweetheart, you obviously have a problem.:::['2-22-261']
you've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father.:::['2-22-262']
okay, mom, you know what? fine. i'll make an appointment.:::['2-22-263']
okay? but you know what? right now, i gotta go. i gotta go do a thing.:::['2-22-264']
did you know your mother spent $1200 on bonsai trees?:::['2-22-265']
i felt like gulliver around that place.:::['2-22-266']
daddy, daddy, i really want to hear more about this......i really do, but i just have to do, uh, some stuff.:::['2-22-267']
you work and you work and you work at a marriage......but all he cares about is his stupid boat.:::['2-22-268']
you work and you work and you work on a boat.:::['2-22-269']
he always ridiculed my pottery classes.:::['2-22-270']
and you sand it and you varnish it.:::['2-22-271']
but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.:::['2-22-272']
one night of her yoga and her bridges of madison county...:::['2-22-273']
sandra: scotch, cigarettes... green: bonsais, the chihuahua...:::['2-22-274']
sandra: i've only been in therapy three weeks now but...:::['2-22-275']
green: what the hell does she want with half a boat?:::['2-22-276']
okay, okay, okay, you can be shirts and i'll be skins.:::['2-22-277']
i'll be skins.:::['2-22-278']
how you holding up there, tiger?:::['2-22-280']
oh. sorry. when my parents were getting divorced, i got a lot of "tigers.":::['2-22-281']
ahem. i got a lot of "champs," "chiefs," "sports.":::['2-22-282']
ahem. i even got a "governor.":::['2-22-283']
this is it, isn't it? i mean, this is what my life is gonna be like.:::['2-22-284']
my mom there, my dad there.:::['2-22-285']
thanksgiving, christmas.:::['2-22-286']
she gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker.:::['2-22-287']
chandler, how did you get through this?:::['2-22-288']
well, i relied on a carefully regimented program......of denial......and wetting the bed.:::['2-22-289']
you know, i just... it's so weird.:::['2-22-290']
i mean, i was in there just listening to them bitch about each other.:::['2-22-291']
all i kept thinking about was the fourth of july.:::['2-22-292']
because it reminded you of the way......our forefathers used to bitch at each other?:::['2-22-293']
it's just this thing.:::['2-22-294']
every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks.:::['2-22-295']
mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big.:::['2-22-296']
my sister jill would be throwing up over the side......and my dad would be upset because nobody was helping.:::['2-22-297']
and then when we did help, he would scream at us for doing it wrong.:::['2-22-298']
but then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up.:::['2-22-299']
you know, and it'd get really cold.:::['2-22-300']
and we'd all just sort of smoosh under this one blanket.:::['2-22-301']
it never occurred to anybody to bring another one.:::['2-22-302']
and now it's...:::['2-22-303']
monica: thanks for coming. i hope you had fun.:::['2-22-305']
all right, monica, dear, i'm gonna hit the road.:::['2-22-306']

dr. green. where are you going? - to get my coat.:::['2-22-320']
no, no, no. we'll get that for you.:::['2-22-321']
all right, all right. i can get my own coat.:::['2-22-322']
sorry, we're on a major flan high.:::['2-22-323']
oh, no. no, you're not supposed to be here.:::['2-22-324']
this is the staging area. it's all wrong. you should leave.:::['2-22-325']
ha, ha. you know, just get out.:::['2-22-326']
or perhaps you'd like a crème de menthe.:::['2-22-327']
i have to be heading toward my chateau. thank you.:::['2-22-328']
all right, well, then i guess we're going back into the hallway again.:::['2-22-329']
thanks for coming, mrs. green.:::['2-22-330']
you take care.:::['2-22-332']
oh, you kids.:::['2-22-333']

monica: okay, everybody, it's time for flan.:::['2-22-337']
chandler: yep. get ready for the gelatinous fun.:::['2-22-338']

monica: okay, that's enough.:::['2-22-340']
phoebe: okay, rachel, make a special flan wish.:::['2-22-341']

phoebe: when i play, i play for me:::['2-6-154']
i don't need your charity:::['2-6-155']
i'm not getting a shot. maybe they can take the needle......and squirt it into my mouth. like a squirt gun.:::['2-6-157']
hello there. i'm dr. carlin.:::['2-6-158']
i see someone's having a little allergic reaction.:::['2-6-159']
doctor, can i see you for just a moment?:::['2-6-160']
my brother has a slight phobia about needles.:::['2-6-161']
did you tell him about my squirt gun idea?:::['2-6-162']
my brother, the ph.d., would like to know......if there's any way to treat this orally?:::['2-6-163']
under these circumstances, it has to be an injection, and it has to be now.:::['2-6-165']
go and have a seat. um, the doctor says it's got to be a needle.:::['2-6-168']
you're just going to have to be brave. can you do that for me?:::['2-6-169']
oh, boy! you are doing so good.:::['2-6-171']
you want to squeeze my hand? - yes.:::['2-6-172']

um, so does your guitar have a strap?:::['2-6-223']
no. - oh. mine does.:::['2-6-224']
stephanie knows all the chords:::['2-6-225']
come on! pick up, pick up!:::['2-6-226']
hello. ahem.:::['2-6-227']
transit authority? yes, hello.:::['2-6-228']
i'm doing research for a book.:::['2-6-229']
i was wondering what somebody might do if they left a baby on a city bus.:::['2-6-230']
yes, i realize that would be a stupid character.:::['2-6-231']
here's the deal: we lost a car seat on a bus.:::['2-6-232']
it's white plastic and it fits onto a stroller.:::['2-6-233']
oh, and there was a baby in it.:::['2-6-234']
he wants to talk to you.:::['2-6-235']
everybody, let's give a warm central perk welcome to...:::['2-6-236']
phoebe: terry's a jerk and he won't let me work:::['2-6-237']
and i hate central perk:::['2-6-238']
uh, to stephanie schiffer!:::['2-6-239']
i'd like to start with a song i wrote for the first man i ever loved.:::['2-6-241']
zachary...:::['2-6-242']
phoebe: are all invited to bite me:::['2-6-243']
both: we're the guys that called about the baby! is he here?!:::['2-6-244']
he's here. - aah!:::['2-6-245']
i assume one of you is the father.:::['2-6-246']
that's me. - i'm him.:::['2-6-247']
actually, uh, ahem, we're both the father.:::['2-6-248']
both: oh, ben! hey, buddy.:::['2-6-249']
please tell me you know which one is our baby.:::['2-6-250']
that one has ducks on his t-shirt and this one has clowns.:::['2-6-251']
and ben was definitely wearing ducks.:::['2-6-252']
or clowns.:::['2-6-253']
that one's ben! remember he had that cute little mole by his mouth!:::['2-6-255']
hey, ben! remember us?:::['2-6-257']
okay, the mole came off.:::['2-6-258']
what are we gonna do? - uh.:::['2-6-259']
we'll flip for it. ducks or clowns.:::['2-6-260']
flip for the baby? - you got a better idea?:::['2-6-261']
all right, call it in the air.:::['2-6-262']
heads.:::['2-6-263']
heads, it is. - yes.:::['2-6-264']
we have to assign heads to something!:::['2-6-265']
right! okay.:::['2-6-266']
ducks is heads because ducks have heads.:::['2-6-268']
what kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?:::['2-6-269']
<i>just call me angel of the morning, angel</i>:::['2-6-270', '2-6-272']
<i>just touch my cheek before you leave me, baby</i>:::['2-6-271']
<i>then slowly turn away</i>:::['2-6-273']
<i>i won't beg you to stay</i>:::['2-6-274']
<i>with me</i>:::['2-6-275']
hey - oh, hi.:::['2-6-276']
here. i thought you might be cold.:::['2-6-277']
oh, look at you! you did pretty well.:::['2-6-280']
but not really, because i put in the first two.:::['2-6-281']
just to get the ball rolling and to make myself feel better.:::['2-6-282']
you know, this whole playing for money thing is so not good for me.:::['2-6-285']
i don't know, when i sang "su-su-suicide"......i got, like, $1.75.:::['2-6-286']
but then "smelly cat"? oh.:::['2-6-287']
i got 25 cents and a condom.:::['2-6-288']
so, you know, now i just feel really bad for "smelly cat.":::['2-6-289']
well, you know.:::['2-6-290']
honey, i don't think everybody gets "smelly cat.":::['2-6-291']
i mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then whoosh!:::['2-6-292']
but it's not even that, you know?:::['2-6-293']
i used to do my songs because it made me happy.:::['2-6-294']
now it's just all about the money, you know?:::['2-6-295']
well, people missed you in there.:::['2-6-296']
in fact, there was actually a request for "smelly cat.":::['2-6-297']
really? from who?:::['2-6-298']
well, me.:::['2-6-299']
and i know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.:::['2-6-300']
uh. did i accidentally drop a condom in your case?:::['2-6-302']
it's kind of an emergency.:::['2-6-303']
here you go. - thanks a lot.:::['2-6-305']
hey, christine! i got it!:::['2-6-306']
i want to thank you for being there for me.:::['2-6-307']
and i'm sorry i almost broke your hand. ha, ha.:::['2-6-308']
that's okay. i'm sorry i poisoned you.:::['2-6-309']
remember the time i jammed that pencil into your hand?:::['2-6-311']
remember it? what do you think this is, a freckle?:::['2-6-312']
what about the time i hit you in the face with sylvian's pumpkin?:::['2-6-314']
remember when i stuck that broom in your spokes......and you hit your head on the curb?:::['2-6-315']
but i remember people telling me about it.:::['2-6-317']
i hope ben has a little sister.:::['2-6-319']
and i hope she can kick his ass.:::['2-6-321']
i'm gonna get a new band-aid.:::['2-6-322']
how about the time i cut the legs off your malibu ken?:::['2-6-323']
monica: that was you?:::['2-6-324']
they were infected. he wouldn't have made it.:::['2-6-326']
my little nephew.:::['2-6-328']
come here, little one!:::['2-6-329']
oh. there's my little baby, ben!:::['2-6-330']
hey, my little boy. oh.:::['2-6-331']
hey, he's not crying!:::['2-6-332', '2-6-333']
there's still pie! ha-ha-ha.:::['2-6-335']
i'm here. i'm here.:::['2-6-336']
uh. how's my little boy, huh?:::['2-6-337']
you want daddy to change your diaper? i know, i know.:::['2-6-338']
did you have fun with, uh, uncle joey and uncle chandler today?:::['2-6-339']
joey: oh, yeah.:::['2-6-340']
he rode the bus today. ross: ooh.:::['2-6-341']
big boy riding the bus...:::['2-6-343']
how come it says, "property of human services"?:::['2-6-345']
you...:::['2-6-346']
you are gonna love this.:::['2-6-347']
can you hold ben for a sec?:::['2-6-348']
stay back! i've got kiwi! run, joey, run!:::['2-6-350']
no, no. i'm sorry, it's, ahem::::['2-6-353']
better! stephanie: yeah?:::['2-6-356']
much better. good.:::['2-6-357']
don't feel bad, because it's a hard song.:::['2-6-358']
you want to try it again? - from the top?:::['2-6-360']
there is no "top," all right?:::['2-6-361']
that's the beauty of "smelly cat.":::['2-6-362']
um. ahem. why don't you just follow me?:::['2-6-363']
okay. phoebe: mm-hm.:::['2-6-364']
both: smelly cat, smelly cat:::['2-6-365']
that's too much. sorry.:::['2-6-369']
mom, would you relax?:::['2-4-0']
that was 10 blocks from here, and the woman was walking alone at night.:::['2-4-1']
i would never do that.:::['2-4-2', '3-12-191']
mom, come on, stop worrying.:::['2-4-3']
this is a safe street. this is a safe building. there's nothing...:::['2-4-4']
aah! oh, my god! what are you doing in here?:::['2-4-5']
mom, i gotta go. i gotta go.:::['2-4-6']
that's fine, you just read the paper.:::['2-4-9']
i'm gonna get a pot.:::['2-4-10']
it's not for you.:::['2-4-11']
okay, that's fine.:::['2-4-12']
read the family circus......enjoy the gentle comedy...:::['2-4-13']
oh, my god. oh, my god. oh, my god.:::['2-4-14']
ugh. oh, god. oh, god.:::['2-4-15']
it's open, you guys.:::['2-4-16']
hi. - hi. can i help you?:::['2-4-17']
i'm looking for phoebe, does she still live here?:::['2-4-18']
uh, no, she doesn't. but i can get a message to her.:::['2-4-19']
great. uh, just tell her her husband stopped by.:::['2-4-20']
her what? aah!:::['2-4-21']
hey, how did you do that?:::['2-4-22']
friends s02e04: the one with phoebe's husband:::['2-4-23']
this is unbelievable, pheebs. how can you be married?:::['2-4-35']
i'm not "married" married, you know?:::['2-4-36']
he was just a friend, and he's gay......and he was from canada, and he needed a green card.:::['2-4-37']
i can't believe you married duncan.:::['2-4-38']
i mean, how could you not tell me? we lived together, we told each other everything.:::['2-4-39']
i'm sorry, monica, but i knew if i told you, you'd get really, like, judgmental......and would not approve. of course i wouldn't approve.:::['2-4-40']
you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay.:::['2-4-41']
i mean, what the hell were you thinking?:::['2-4-42']
see? and you thought she'd be judgmental.:::['2-4-43']
okay, i wasn't in love with him. i was just helping out a friend.:::['2-4-44']
please. when he left town, you stayed in your pajamas for a month.:::['2-4-45']
and i saw you eat a cheeseburger.:::['2-4-46']
well, didn't you?:::['2-4-47']
i might have.:::['2-4-48']
come on. like you tell me everything? what have i not told you?:::['2-4-50']
ooh, i don't know. um......how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours......from when you were having sex with fun bobby on the terrace.:::['2-4-51']
rachel: what? - wait a minute. who told you?:::['2-4-52']
you are dead meat.:::['2-4-53']
i didn't know it was a big secret.:::['2-4-54']
oh, it's not big. not at all.:::['2-4-55']
you know, kind of on the same lines as, say:::['2-4-56']
i don't know, having a third nipple.:::['2-4-57']
you have a third nipple?:::['2-4-58']
whip it out. whip it out. phoebe: yeah, yeah.:::['2-4-60']
no, come on. there's nothing to see. it's just a tiny bump. it's totally useless.:::['2-4-61']
oh, as opposed to your other multifunctional nipples?:::['2-4-62']
i can't believe you. you told me it was a nubbin.:::['2-4-63']
joey, what did you think a nubbin was?:::['2-4-64']
i don't know. you see something, you hear a word, i thought that's what it was.:::['2-4-65']
let me see it again. ross: yeah, show us your nubbin.:::['2-4-66']
joey was in a porno movie.:::['2-4-67']
if i'm going down, i'm taking everybody with me.:::['2-4-68']
rachel: oh, my god. ross: you were in a porno?:::['2-4-69']
i was young and i just wanted a job, okay?:::['2-4-70']
but at the last minute i couldn't go through with it.:::['2-4-71']
so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't......because there's people having sex on it.:::['2-4-72']
that is wild.:::['2-4-74']
so, what's it shaped like? - is there a hair on it?:::['2-4-75']
what happens if you flick it?:::['2-4-76']
so, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?:::['2-4-77']
why, yes, ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance......to the magical land of narnia.:::['2-4-78']
you know, in some cultures, having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.:::['2-4-79']
you get the best huts, and women dance naked around you.:::['2-4-80']
huh. are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?:::['2-4-81']
you know, you are so amazing. is there anything you don't know?:::['2-4-82']
ooh, julie's so smart. julie's so special.:::['2-4-83']
look, honey, i wanted you to hook up with ross as much as you did.:::['2-4-84']
but he's with her now. you're just gonna have to get over it.:::['2-4-85']
oh, i'm going to have to get over it.:::['2-4-86']
god, see, i didn't know that's what i had to do. i just have to get over it.:::['2-4-87']
all: whoa.:::['2-4-88']
ross: sassy lady. julie: where are you going?:::['2-4-89']
um, i'm gonna go meet duncan. he's skating tonight at the garden.:::['2-4-90']
he's in the capades.:::['2-4-91']
the ice capades? - no, no, the gravel capades.:::['2-4-92']
yeah, the turns aren't as fast, but when snoopy falls? funny.:::['2-4-93']
i can't believe you're dressing up for him. you're setting yourself up all over again.:::['2-4-94']
for your information, i'm going to see him so i can put all those feelings behind me.:::['2-4-96']
and the reason i'm dressed like this is because i think it's nice......to look nice for your gay husband.:::['2-4-97']
darn it, we're all out of milk.:::['2-4-98']
hey, chandler, will you fill me up here?:::['2-4-99']
oh, i see, i see. because of the third-nipple thing.:::['2-4-100']
okay, sweetie, i'll see you later. - bye.:::['2-4-101']
see you later, rach. - bye-bye, julie.:::['2-4-102']
hey, come on, cut it out.:::['2-4-104']
ross: hey. rachel: what?:::['2-4-105']
can i ask you something? - sure.:::['2-4-106']
ross: eh. rachel: what?:::['2-4-107']
come on, talk to me. - okay.:::['2-4-108']
what's the longest you've been in a relationship before......having the sex?:::['2-4-109']
why? who's not...? are you and julie not...?:::['2-4-110']
are you and julie not having sex?:::['2-4-111']
technically? no.:::['2-4-113']
is it because she's so cold in bed?:::['2-4-114']
or is it because she's kind of bossy, makes it feel like school?:::['2-4-115']
no. no. she's great. and it's not like we haven't done anything.:::['2-4-116']
i mean, we do plenty of other stuff. lots of other stuff like...:::['2-4-117']
no, no, no. don't need to know the details.:::['2-4-118']
no, it's just...:::['2-4-119']
it's me.:::['2-4-120', '3-24-184']
you know, i've only been with one woman my whole life......and she turned out to be a lesbian. uh-huh.:::['2-4-121']
so now i've got myself all psyched out.:::['2-4-122']
it's become, like, this......this thing, and i...:::['2-4-123']
you must just think i'm weird.:::['2-4-124']
no. no, no, no. i don't think it's weird.:::['2-4-125']
i think... i think, um, in fact...:::['2-4-126']
in fact, you know what i think? - what?:::['2-4-127']
i think it's sexy.:::['2-4-128']
sexy?:::['2-4-129']
let me tell you something. as a woman... ...there is nothing sexier......than a man who does not want to have sex.:::['2-4-130']
no kidding. - oh, yeah. in fact, you know what i'd do?:::['2-4-131']
i'd wait.:::['2-4-132']
you'd wait? - yes, absolutely. i would wait......and wait...:::['2-4-133']
then i'd wait some more.:::['2-4-134']
i don't care how much she tells you she wants it, i don't care if she begs... ...she pleads:::['2-4-136']
she tells you she's gonna have sex with another man.:::['2-4-137']
that just means it's working.:::['2-4-138']
women really want this?:::['2-4-139']
more than jewelry.:::['2-4-140']
phoebe. - ta-da.:::['2-4-142']
ah, look at you. you look great.:::['2-4-144']

oh, listen, listen... i wanted to thank you for, uh, our little talk before.:::['2-4-166']
oh, god, no problem. so you're gonna go with the waiting thing?:::['2-4-167']
well, i was going to, but after i talked to you, i talked to joey.:::['2-4-168']
good. ahem. what did he say?:::['2-4-169']
basically, he told me to get over myself and just do it.:::['2-4-170']
so i thought about what you said and about what he said.:::['2-4-171']
and, well, his way, i get to have sex tonight, so...:::['2-4-172']
what is this in my pocket?:::['2-4-173']
why, it's joey's porno movie.:::['2-4-174']
pop it in.:::['2-4-175']
i'm fine with it, i mean, if you're okay watching a video filled with two-nippled people.:::['2-4-176']
great. people having sex. that's just what i need to see.:::['2-4-177']
what's wrong with people having sex?:::['2-4-178']
well, um, you know, these movies are offensive......and, uh, degrading to women and females...:::['2-4-180']
and, uh, the lighting's always unflattering.:::['2-4-181']
monica, help me out here. - hell, i wanna see joey.:::['2-4-183']
so is there, like, a story, or do they just start doing it right...:::['2-4-184']
oh. never mind.:::['2-4-185']
okay, now, wait a minute. that is the craziest typing test i've ever seen.:::['2-4-186']
all i say is, she better get the job.:::['2-4-187']
looks to me like he's the one getting the job.:::['2-4-188']
shh. hey, here i come. here i come.:::['2-4-189']
see, i'm coming to fix the copier.:::['2-4-190']
so i just watch them have sex.:::['2-4-192']
and then i say... here's my line.:::['2-4-193']
joey: you know, that's bad for the paper tray.:::['2-4-194']
nice work, my friend. - thank you.:::['2-4-195']
wait, you see me again. hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.:::['2-4-196']
so, um... so, what's up? you came to see me yesterday.:::['2-4-198']
oh, yeah, um...:::['2-4-199']
i kind of need a divorce.:::['2-4-201']
how come?:::['2-4-203', '4-11-151']
um, actually, i'm getting married again.:::['2-4-204']
what? oh, god, i don't know how to tell you this.:::['2-4-205']
i'm straight.:::['2-4-206']
i don't understand. i don't understand. how can you be straight?:::['2-4-208']
i mean, you're so smart and funny... ...and you throw such great academy award parties.:::['2-4-209']
i know. that's what i kept telling myself.:::['2-4-210']
but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore.:::['2-4-211']
so how long have you known?:::['2-4-212']
i guess on some level i always knew i was straight.:::['2-4-213']
i thought i was supposed to be something else.:::['2-4-214']
you know, i'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay. i was just trying to fit in.:::['2-4-215']
and, um...:::['2-4-216', '2-20-192']
and there's actually a woman?:::['2-4-217']
her name's debra. - oh.:::['2-4-218']
well, is she the first that you've been with?:::['2-4-219']
well, i've never told you this......but there were one or two times back in college......when i'd get really drunk and go to a straight bar......and wake up with a woman next to me.:::['2-4-220']
but i told myself it was the liquor, and everyone experiments in college.:::['2-4-221']
but now i know i don't have a choice about this. i was born this way.:::['2-4-223']
you know, you're married to someone for six years... and you think you know him.:::['2-4-225']
and then one day he says, "oh, i'm not gay.":::['2-4-226']
i'm... i'm still me.:::['2-4-227']
why couldn't you just have figured this out six years ago?:::['2-4-228']
you know, it still smells like monkey in there.:::['2-4-229']
well, that saves us the conversation.:::['2-4-230']
well, this has been great, but i'm officially wiped.:::['2-4-231']
me too. we should get going. rachel: no.:::['2-4-232']
no. i mean... no. come on, you guys.:::['2-4-233']
come on, look, it's only 11:30.:::['2-4-234']
let's just talk. we never just hang out and talk anymore.:::['2-4-235']
rachel, that's all we do.:::['2-4-236']
maybe that's all we do. what about julie?:::['2-4-237']
what about julie?:::['2-4-238']
well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now......and we don't really know you.:::['2-4-239']
i mean, who is julie? i mean, what do you like? what don't you like?:::['2-4-240']
we want to know everything.:::['2-4-241']
well, heh, that could take a while.:::['2-4-242']
i mean, who here does not have the time to get to know julie?:::['2-4-244']
i got the time to get to know julie. - i got time, yeah.:::['2-4-245']
uh, rach, ahem, i know her pretty well. can i go?:::['2-4-246']
okay, julie, so let's start with your childhood. what was that like?:::['2-4-248']
well, in a nutshell... - ah-ah-ah.:::['2-4-249']
so, um, have you told your parents?:::['2-4-250']
no, but it'll be okay. they're pretty cool.:::['2-4-251']
my brother's straight, so...:::['2-4-252']
you know what? i just have one more question. um...:::['2-4-254']
if you had figured this out sooner, and, um, i had been around......do you think i would have been the one who?:::['2-4-255']
no, no. that's all right. don't tell me.:::['2-4-256']
i don't think either answer would make me feel better. here.:::['2-4-257']
i love you, phoebe.:::['2-4-258']
so your brother's straight, huh?:::['2-4-259']
and my second-grade teacher was miss thomas......and my first-grade teacher was mrs. cobb.:::['2-4-261']
ahem. mrs. gobb?:::['2-4-262']
no, cobb. like cobb salad.:::['2-4-263']
hmm, okay.:::['2-4-264']
now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?:::['2-4-265']
i'm going home.:::['2-4-266']
boy, that julie's a talker, huh?:::['2-4-267']
rachel: whew.:::['2-4-269']
so... - good night.:::['2-4-270']
it's pretty late. you're probably, uh, not still planning on...:::['2-4-271']
oh. no, no, i am. - oh.:::['2-4-272']
well, hey, are you nervous?:::['2-4-273']
no, no. i, uh...:::['2-4-274']
i have done it before.:::['2-4-275']
well, okay, i mean, how are you gonna handle it?:::['2-4-276']
are you gonna talk about it beforehand? are you just gonna pounce?:::['2-4-277']
i, uh... i don't know. i guess i'm just gonna......see what happens.:::['2-4-278']
what...? uh...:::['2-4-280']
what? - nothing. i mean, um...:::['2-4-281']
it is your first time with her, and, you know, if the first time doesn't go well......well then, that's pretty darn hard to recover from.:::['2-4-282']
okay, now i'm nervous.:::['2-4-283']
maybe you should put it off.:::['2-4-284']
no, i don't want to put it off.:::['2-4-285']
god, i'm just... i spent last year being so unbelievably miserable.:::['2-4-286']
and now i'm actually happy.:::['2-4-287']
you know, i mean, really happy.:::['2-4-288']
i just don't wanna...:::['2-4-289']
i don't wanna mess it up, you know?:::['2-4-290']
i'm sorry. no, it's not your fault.:::['2-4-293']
maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.:::['2-4-295']
maybe you were on the right track with that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.:::['2-4-296']
i mean, women really like that. - really?:::['2-4-297']
yeah. i mean, you know, if...:::['2-4-298']
i mean if it were me, i'd, you know, want you to...:::['2-4-299']
what? - i don't know, catch me off guard. you know, with, like, a really......good kiss.:::['2-4-300']
you know, really......sort of, um, soft at first.:::['2-4-301']
and then maybe, um, brush the hair away from my face.:::['2-4-302']
and then look far into my eyes......in a way that lets me know something......amazing is about to happen.:::['2-4-303']
and then, i don't know, then......you'd pull me really close to you so that...:::['2-4-305']
so that i'd be pressed up, you know, right against you.:::['2-4-306']
and, um, it would get kind of......sweaty......and, uh... and blurry.:::['2-4-307']
and then it's just happening.:::['2-4-308']
thanks, rach. good night.:::['2-4-310']
well, somebody got some last night.:::['2-4-313']
what you guys doing? - monica's making us watch old yeller.:::['2-20-1']
why are you guys upset? it's old yeller. it's a happy movie.:::['2-20-2']
what? - what are you talking about?:::['2-20-3']
come on. happy family gets a dog.:::['2-20-4']
frontier fun!:::['2-20-5']
pheebs, what about the end?:::['2-20-6']
oh, when yeller saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?:::['2-20-7']
that's not the end.:::['2-20-8']
yeah-huh. that's when my mother would shut off the tv and say, "the end.":::['2-20-9']
what about when he has rabies?:::['2-20-10']
he doesn't have rabies. he has babies.:::['2-20-11']
that's what my mom said.:::['2-20-12']
uh, phoebe, i don't think she'd want you to see what's about to happen.:::['2-20-13']
why? what's about to happen?:::['2-20-14']
i've never seen this part.:::['2-20-15']
hey, travis, what you doing with that gun?:::['2-20-16']
no, no, travis, put down the gun.:::['2-20-18']
no, no, he's your buddy. he's your yeller.:::['2-20-19']
no! the end! the end!:::['2-20-20']
okay, what kind of a sick doggy snuff film is this?:::['2-20-21']
friends s02e20: the one where old yeller dies:::['2-20-22']
have you guys eaten? uh, richard and i just finished, and we've got leftovers.:::['2-20-34']
chicken and potatoes.:::['2-20-35']
what am i wearing?:::['2-20-36']
actually, nothing but rubber gloves.:::['2-20-37']
one of these times, you'll really be naked and we won't come over.:::['2-20-38']
i got a leg, three breasts and a wing.:::['2-20-39']
how do you find clothes that fit?:::['2-20-40']
oh, hey, monica? we got a question.:::['2-20-41']
all right, yes, i see other women in the shower at the gym.:::['2-20-42']
and no, i don't look.:::['2-20-43']
no, not that one.:::['2-20-44']
we're figuring out who to bring to the knicks game.:::['2-20-45']
ross can't go, so it's between my friend eric prower, who has breath issues......and dan, with the poking. "did you see that play?":::['2-20-46']
"you want more beer? is that spike lee?":::['2-20-47']
why don't you ask richard?:::['2-20-49']
uh, richard, if you had an extra ticket to the knicks game......and you had to choose between a friend who smelled......and one who bruises you, who would you pick?:::['2-20-50']
being a huge knicks fan myself......i think you should take someone who's a huge knicks fan.:::['2-20-52']
that's eric.:::['2-20-54']
glad to be of help. matches.:::['2-20-55']
i meant, why don't you take richard to the game?:::['2-20-56']
chandler & joey: eh.:::['2-20-57']
i don't know. - come on!:::['2-20-59']
he keeps his fingers to himself, and he's always minty fresh.:::['2-20-60']
richard's really nice. uh, we just don't know him really well.:::['2-20-61']
plus, he's old...:::['2-20-62']
er than some people.:::['2-20-63']
but, uh, younger than some buildings.:::['2-20-64']
so what, he's a little older. big deal.:::['2-20-65']
he's important to me.:::['2-20-66']
if you ask him, he might take you in his jag.:::['2-20-67']
how do we say yes......and make it seem like it's not just to ride in the cool car?:::['2-20-68']
okay, this could be tough.:::['2-20-69']
okay, okay, okay. monica?:::['2-20-70']
we'll bring him, but only if he takes the jaguar.:::['2-20-71']
ooh, you almost had it.:::['2-20-72']
no, no, you're fine. you're fine.:::['2-20-73']
hello, ha, ha. - hey.:::['2-20-74']
hi, honey. oh.:::['2-20-75']
you are not gonna believe what happened!:::['2-20-76']
we were playing on the floor, and he grabs the table......and he pulls himself up!:::['2-20-77']
he pulled himself up!:::['2-20-78']
standing man!:::['2-20-79']
i'm sorry you missed it, but i did tape it if you wanna see it.:::['2-20-80']
uh, we know. he already did it last week.:::['2-20-81']
you can watch our tape if you want.:::['2-20-82']
ah, see, i don't believe this. i missed the first time of everything.:::['2-20-83']
the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled.:::['2-20-84']
what else? has he spoken? is he driving?:::['2-20-85']
does he have a favorite liqueur?:::['2-20-86']
he is getting closer on the talking thing.:::['2-20-87']
he can't quite say "mama" yet, but once he said "yemen.":::['2-20-88']
see, i don't know. i'm so sick of missing stuff.:::['2-20-89']
i want him for more than a day. i want him for a whole weekend.:::['2-20-90']
listen. i feel...:::['2-20-91']
that would be great.:::['2-20-92', '5-21-334']
really? i had a whole speech prepared.:::['2-20-93']
oh, shoot, that would've been fun.:::['2-20-94']
oh, look, did you just see that?:::['2-20-95']
did you see? he just waved! he just waved!:::['2-20-96']
he's never waved before!:::['2-20-97']
yes, he has. very good.:::['2-20-98']
hey. - hey, pheebs. what you got there?:::['2-20-99']
love story, brian's song and terms of endearment.:::['2-20-100']
wow, all you need now is the killing fields......and some guacamole, and you got yourself a party!:::['2-20-101']
i talked to my grandma about the old yeller incident......and she said my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies......to shield us from the pain and sadness.:::['2-20-102']
you know, before she killed herself.:::['2-20-103']
where's richard? did you ditch him?:::['2-20-105']
after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie.:::['2-20-106']
what's the matter with you? he's parking the car.:::['2-20-107']
did you guys have fun? - your boyfriend is so cool.:::['2-20-108']
he let us drive his jaguar. joey for 12 blocks. me for 15.:::['2-20-109']
rachel: wow.:::['2-20-110']
he must like you best.:::['2-20-111']
oh, what about when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats?:::['2-20-112']
you never even saw the money.:::['2-20-113']
hey, chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats.:::['2-20-114']
ha, ha, you're welcome. hey, joey, thanks for parking the car.:::['2-20-115']
no problem, ha, ha.:::['2-20-116']
hey, chandler... - i think they get it.:::['2-20-117']
chandler: there's the man!:::['2-20-118']
hey, you're getting better. - huh? ha, ha.:::['2-20-120']
i'm gonna keep this.:::['2-20-121']
he kept my dollar.:::['2-20-123']
your first weekend without ben. what are you doing?:::['2-20-124']
ah, we're going to colonial williamsburg.:::['2-20-125']
a woman i went to college with is the first female blacksmith there.:::['2-20-126']
they're a little behind the times in colonial williamsburg.:::['2-20-127']
ha, ha. well, look, i better go before mommy starts weeping.:::['2-20-128']
susan: we love you. - bye, mommy.:::['2-20-129']
ross: have a good time.:::['2-20-130']
okay, ben.:::['2-20-131']
ross. - yeah?:::['2-20-132']
joey, do you know we can see you from here?:::['2-20-134']
how come richard looks cooler with one of these?:::['2-20-135']
you may wanna light it and lose the spatula.:::['2-20-136']
it's cute, you trying to be more like richard.:::['2-20-137']
not like him, per se.:::['2-20-138']
just not unlike him.:::['2-20-139']
it's the artist formerly known as chandler.:::['2-20-140']
i'm just trying something here, you know?:::['2-20-141']
why didn't you grow a mustache?:::['2-20-142']
oh, we flipped for it.:::['2-20-143']
i got the cigar, he got the mustache.:::['2-20-144']
if we both grew them, we'd look like dorks.:::['2-20-145']
you really sidestepped that land mine.:::['2-20-146']
i promised richard we'd meet downstairs.:::['2-20-147']
you're meeting richard?:::['2-20-148']
ranger game. - didn't he tell you?:::['2-20-149']
he said he was going out with the guys. i didn't know that was you.:::['2-20-150']
we're the guys! - we're the guys!:::['2-20-152']
with that mustache, he reminds me of aunt sylvia.:::['2-20-153']
hi, we're visiting. - yay.:::['2-20-155']
it's ben and his dada.:::['2-20-156']
dada.:::['2-20-157']
can you say "dada"? - aw.:::['2-20-158']
i'm telling your mommies you said it, so you might as well.:::['2-20-159']
no luck, huh? - no.:::['2-20-160']
a while ago, i got a "seh" out of him......which i thought might turn into "seh-condary caregiver," but...:::['2-20-161']
would you, uh, hold him for a sec? i gotta take this off.:::['2-20-162']
oh, yeah, sure, okay. - there we go.:::['2-20-163']
i'm holding ben.:::['2-20-165']
yeah, well, he's a baby, not a bomb.:::['2-20-166']
hold him like you'd hold a football.:::['2-20-168']
this is how i would hold a football.:::['2-20-169']
here. here. there we go.:::['2-20-170']
sorry, i'm not very good with babies. i haven't been around them.:::['2-20-171']
i mean, you know, since i was one. - ha, ha.:::['2-20-172']
it's all right. no big deal. - really?:::['2-20-173']
you'll feel different when it's our baby.:::['2-20-174']
you think about stuff like that?:::['2-20-176']
uh, yeah. i mean...:::['2-20-177']
actually, i kind of think that we'll have two babies.:::['2-20-178']
two babies?:::['2-20-179']
you know, a boy and a girl.:::['2-20-180']
hopefully, the girl will come first, so ben won't feel competitive.:::['2-20-181']
then what's gonna happen?:::['2-20-182']
we won't wanna raise kids in the city, so we'll move to scarsdale.:::['2-20-183']
scar... uh-huh.:::['2-20-184']
we'll be far enough from our parents so we don't have to see them......but close enough that they can babysit.:::['2-20-185']
and yes, i know the taxes are a little higher than nassau county......but the school system's great.:::['2-20-186']
wow! ha, ha.:::['2-20-187']
wow, that's great! great!:::['2-20-188']
okay, wow! you know what? ross: hmm?:::['2-20-189']
i'm off my break now. so, uh...:::['2-20-190']
um, here. you take this.:::['2-20-191']
i'm gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee.:::['2-20-193']
look at that. i don't have a pot.:::['2-20-195']
i don't have a pot. maybe i've got one at home.:::['2-20-196']
or in scarsdale. hey, is that a door?:::['2-20-197']
hey. - hey, pheebs. what's happening?:::['2-20-199']
oh, okay, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the andes.:::['2-20-200']

she dies. she has babies and dies.:::['2-20-206']
it's like, "welcome home from the hospital." thud!:::['2-20-207']
you wanna feel better?:::['2-20-208']
phoebe: yeah. - okay.:::['2-20-209']

it's a wonderful life. yes, i've heard of this.:::['2-20-211']
so you can't lose. it's there in the title.:::['2-20-212']
wonderfulness is baked right in.:::['2-20-213']
i fell for that with pride of the yankees.:::['2-20-214']
i thought i'd see a film about yankee pride.:::['2-20-215']
and boom! the guy gets lou gehrig's disease.:::['2-20-216']
uh, the guy was lou gehrig. didn't you kind of see it coming?:::['2-20-217']
watch that. it'll restore all your faith in humanity.:::['2-20-218']
hey, big guy. game time.:::['2-20-219']
hey! be right there! - there's a game?:::['2-20-220']
i just got my pik-up stiks back from the shop.:::['2-20-221']
bring your nerves of steel.:::['2-20-222']
it's the basketball playoffs.:::['2-20-223']
um, i appreciate this, but you don't have to hang out with them for me.:::['2-20-224']
they have each other.:::['2-20-225']
oh, no, honey. i mean, don't worry.:::['2-20-226']
i like hanging out with them. they're different than my other friends.:::['2-20-227']
they don't start sentences with "you know who just died shoveling snow?":::['2-20-228']
all right, that's great. then just go.:::['2-20-229']

uh, it's the college playoffs. monica: oh.:::['2-20-231']
then, go vassar! - uh, they're not in it.:::['2-20-232']
okay, then just go. - okay.:::['2-20-233']
ugh, why does this bother me so much?:::['2-20-234']
i'm not one of those people who wants to spend 24 hours a day together.:::['2-20-235']
he just doesn't have much free time. what do i do?:::['2-20-237']
does it matter? you'll just die or divorce or blow your pet's head off.:::['2-20-238']
ugh! - me too!:::['2-20-239']
rachel, i got a question. richard made plans again with the guys...:::['2-20-240']
ross made plans for the century.:::['2-20-241']
i'm gonna go read cosmo. maybe there's something helpful in it.:::['2-20-242']
if not, i can learn how to do a bikini wax with leftover christmas candles.:::['2-20-243']
what happened back there?:::['2-20-245']
rachel: i don't know. you tell me.:::['2-20-246']
one minute i'm holding ben, then i've got two kids......l'm living in scarsdale complaining about taxes!:::['2-20-247']
well, i'm sorry. i think about stuff.:::['2-20-248']
you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders.:::['2-20-249']
you've planned out the next 20 years. we've dated for six weeks!:::['2-20-250']
you never think about our future?:::['2-20-251']
i think about whose apartment we'll sleep at tomorrow......and where we'll have dinner next saturday!:::['2-20-252']
i do not think about our children's names!:::['2-20-253']
you know what our children's names will be?:::['2-20-254']
ha, ha, no.:::['2-20-255']
no, i mean, you know. i read a book, and there was a girl named emily.:::['2-20-256']
and i thought that might be good.:::['2-20-257']
what was the book?:::['2-20-258']
the big book of children's names.:::['2-20-259']
okay. ross, ross.:::['2-20-260']
what we have is amazing.:::['2-20-262']
but i do not want everything decided for me!:::['2-20-263']
i spent my whole life like that.:::['2-20-264']
it's what i had with barry. that's a reason i left.:::['2-20-265']
i like not knowing right now.:::['2-20-266']
sorry if that scares you, but if you wanna be with me, deal with that!:::['2-20-267']
okay, fine! - thank you!:::['2-20-268']
we're not done! - i didn't know that.:::['2-20-269']
you're with a guy who won't stop planning his future with you.:::['2-20-270']
he knows we'll end up together.:::['2-20-271']
if that scares you, tough! you'll have to deal with that.:::['2-20-272']
i will! - good, because i love you!:::['2-20-273']
oh, yeah? i love you too!:::['2-20-274']
that's the first time we've said that! - yes.:::['2-20-275']
i'm gonna kiss you! - you better!:::['2-20-276']
oh, thanks for the great movie tip.:::['2-20-278']
did you like it? - oh, yeah.:::['2-20-279']
i don't know if i was happier when george bailey destroyed the business......or, um, donna reed cried or when the pharmacist made his ear bleed.:::['2-20-280']
i'll give you the ear thing, but wasn't the ending wonderful?:::['2-20-281']
i didn't watch it. i was too depressed.:::['2-20-282']
it kept getting worse! it should've been called::::['2-20-283']
"it's a sucky life, and just when you think it can't suck anymore, it does!":::['2-20-284']
kick, save! and......denied!:::['2-20-285']
he gets it back. pass to the middle, lines it up and bam!:::['2-20-286']
could that shot be any prettier?:::['2-20-288']
man, you are incredible.:::['2-20-289']
we had a table in college.:::['2-20-290']
oh, really? i didn't know they had foosball in the 1800s.:::['2-20-291']
nice mustache. at puberty, that thing will really kick in.:::['2-20-292']
not to sound too florence henderson, but dinner's on the table.:::['2-20-293']
one more point.:::['2-20-294']
monica: score!:::['2-20-295']
now can we go? - uh...:::['2-20-296']
that's why we don't let her play.:::['2-20-297']
is everything all right? - mm-hm.:::['2-20-298']
oh, hey, don't be mad at him. it's our fault.:::['2-20-300']
i'm sorry we've been hogging his time.:::['2-20-301']
he's just really great to hang out with.:::['2-20-302']
well... joey: no, seriously.:::['2-20-303']
we just talked about this. he is so much cooler than our dads.:::['2-20-304']
our dads are okay and all, but richard is just...:::['2-20-305']
ow, ow, ow. what are you kicking me for?:::['2-20-306']
huh? i'm trying to talk here.:::['2-20-307']
uh, you guys see me as a dad?:::['2-20-308']
oh, yeah. - no!:::['2-20-309']
you're just clearly not familiar with our young persons' vernacular.:::['2-20-311']
when we say "dad," we mean "buddy.":::['2-20-312']
we mean "pal." - uh-huh, yeah.:::['2-20-313']
no, seriously. joey's my dad.:::['2-20-314']
monica's my dad.:::['2-20-315']
i've even got some dads down at work.:::['2-20-316']
well, your other dad and i are gonna go have a romantic evening.:::['2-20-318']
i'll just see you kids around.:::['2-20-319']
nighty-night.:::['2-20-320']
chandler: you're not a dad! - you're not a dad!:::['2-20-321']
i can't believe you got us into trouble.:::['2-20-322']
so are you okay?:::['2-20-323']
just......i feel like i'm about a hundred.:::['2-20-325']
i thought i was just one of the guys.:::['2-20-326']
i'll make you feel like one of the guys.:::['2-20-328']
richard: mm.:::['2-20-329']
for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball.:::['2-20-330']
i was killing them.:::['2-20-331']
yeah, well they suck too. - ha, ha.:::['2-20-332']
monica: hmm.:::['2-20-333']
you take the poopy diaper and put it in the poopy diaper pail.:::['2-20-334']
calling it a "poopy diaper" doesn't make this process any cuter.:::['2-20-335']
hello. carol: it's us.:::['2-20-336']
ross: come on up.:::['2-20-337']
i'll get his stuff together.:::['2-20-338']
okay, we can do this now, can't we, ben?:::['2-20-339']
yes, we can.:::['2-20-340']
there! i did it!:::['2-20-341']
ha, ha, i did it!:::['2-20-342']
ooh, look at that!:::['2-20-343']
oh, it stays on and everything.:::['2-20-344']
hi. ben: hi.:::['2-20-345']
i'm sorry. what did you just say? did you just say "hi"?:::['2-20-346']
oh, my god! ross? ben just said hi!:::['2-20-347']
what? - ben just said hi!:::['2-20-348']
what, the word "hi"?:::['2-20-349']
no, my uncle hi.:::['2-20-350']
great! and i missed that too. i miss everything!:::['2-20-351']
oh, i'm sorry. i guess i just bring it out in him.:::['2-20-352']
where is he? - we missed you.:::['2-20-353']
we missed you so much! come here, ben, ha, ha.:::['2-20-354']
guess what? ben just said his first word.:::['2-20-355']
both: what did he say?:::['2-20-356']
something about hi.:::['2-20-357']
that's so exciting! - mommy's so proud of you!:::['2-20-358']
hi. hi?:::['2-20-359']
you know, actually, it's more like, hi!:::['2-20-360']
hi? - hi.:::['2-20-361']
this could go on for a while.:::['2-20-363']
you're right. we've got a cab waiting.:::['2-20-364']
well, this was fun.:::['2-20-365']
we should do it again sometime, ben. what do you say?:::['2-20-366']
all right, so i've got him? - tuesday.:::['2-20-368']
bye, you guys.:::['2-20-369']
susan: take care. - bye, ben.:::['2-20-370']
ben: bye.:::['2-20-371']
did he just say "bye"?:::['2-20-372']
he said bye!:::['2-20-373']
you said... he said bye to me!:::['2-20-374']
yes, he did! - oh.:::['2-20-375']
suddenly i'm seeing him go off to college!:::['2-20-376']
we've gotta go. we've got that cab downstairs.:::['2-20-377']
bye. ben: bye.:::['2-20-379', '2-20-381']
oh! - ha, ha.:::['2-20-380']
wow. look at this nice deep hole i dug. hey, bert......isn't this a nice hole here?:::['2-20-384']
phoebe: okay, ahem.:::['2-20-385']
ben, this is the part where ernie buries bert in the sand and can't find him.:::['2-20-386']
now, i've looked ahead on the tape, and he does find him again.:::['2-20-387']
but before that happens, there's some rough going for a while.:::['2-20-388']
but i think we can handle it.:::['2-20-389']
and there's just the alphabet, but we know that ends well, so...:::['2-20-390']
bert? bert?:::['2-20-392']
bert?:::['2-20-393']
what happened to my friend bert? he was here just a moment ago.:::['2-20-394']
oh, no! my old friend bert is lost.:::['2-20-395']
mm. - i'm so glad you're here.:::['2-20-396']
stocks and bonds are moving higher...:::['2-21-0']
why are we watching the business channel?:::['2-21-1']
because the other day i saw there was a stock with my initials, meg, on it.:::['2-21-2']
sometimes it takes two or three hours before it comes up again.:::['2-21-3']
but when it does, it's exciting.:::['2-21-4']
hmm, okay, honey, you really need a job.:::['2-21-5']
dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview.:::['2-21-6']
right there! that's the third sign today. right there.:::['2-21-7']
on behalf of everyone, i'd just like to say, "huh?":::['2-21-8']
no, you just said "dad." and everywhere i go today......i keep getting signs telling me to go see my father.:::['2-21-9']
like when i was walking over here and i passed a buffet.:::['2-21-10']
which is my father's last name.:::['2-21-11']
all: ah.:::['2-21-12']
and they were serving franks......which is his first name, minus the "s" at the end.:::['2-21-13']
rachel: yes. ross: all right.:::['2-21-14']
and there was a rotisserie with a spinning chicken.:::['2-21-15']
his indian name?:::['2-21-16']
no. because i chickened out the last time......when i tried to meet him. so coincidences? i don't think so.:::['2-21-17']
very freaky. - eerie.:::['2-21-18']
who wants the last hamburger?:::['2-21-19']
that's it. now i have to go see him, ha, ha.:::['2-21-20']
hamburger? mcdonald's?:::['2-21-22']
old mcdonald had a farm. my dad is a pharmacist.:::['2-21-23']
friends s02e21: the one with the two bullies:::['2-21-25']
man, i am so beat.:::['2-21-37']
you wanna forget racquetball and hang out?:::['2-21-39']
hey, you're in our seats. - oh, sorry, we didn't know.:::['2-21-41']
hey, we were sitting there.:::['2-21-42']
okay. there is one more way to say it.:::['2-21-43']
who knows it? ha, ha. - ha, ha.:::['2-21-44']
is that supposed to be funny? - actually, i was going for colorful.:::['2-21-45']
what's with this guy? - what's with you?:::['2-21-46']
uh, nothing. nothing's with him.:::['2-21-47']
enjoy your coffee.:::['2-21-48']
what just happened?:::['2-21-49']
i just took your hat.:::['2-21-50']
see, i can be funny too.:::['2-21-51']
my joke is that i took your hat.:::['2-21-52']
can i have it back?:::['2-21-54']
no? - no.:::['2-21-56', '2-21-227']
you know what? i think you're very funny.:::['2-21-58']
kudos on that hat joke. ha, ha.:::['2-21-59']
but come on, guys, just give him back the hat.:::['2-21-60']
why should we?:::['2-21-61']
because it's a special hat.:::['2-21-62']
he bought it because he was feeling down one day.:::['2-21-63']
so he got the hat......to cheer himself up, you know?:::['2-21-64']
now, chandler... - stop talking. stop talking now.:::['2-21-65']
let me get this straight. you're stealing my hat?:::['2-21-66']
you got a problem?:::['2-21-67']
i just want to make sure we're on the same page.:::['2-21-68']
how'd the interview go?:::['2-21-69']
it bit.:::['2-21-70']
it was a '50s theme restaurant.:::['2-21-71']
i'd have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter.:::['2-21-72']
i was a sous-chef at café des artistes.:::['2-21-73']
how can i take a job where i have to make laverne-and-curly fries?:::['2-21-74']
don't do it. - how can i not do it?:::['2-21-75']
i have $127 in the bank.:::['2-21-76']
monica, relax. go get a beer.:::['2-21-77']
i don't want a beer.:::['2-21-78']
who said it was for you?:::['2-21-79']
both: hi.:::['2-21-80']
some mean guys at the coffeehouse took my hat.:::['2-21-82']
no. - you're kidding.:::['2-21-83']
ross: it was ridiculous. these guys were bullies.:::['2-21-84']
actual bullies.:::['2-21-85']
we're grownups. this kind of stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore.:::['2-21-86']
chandler: oh...:::['2-21-88']
oh, no, wait a minute. i have no one.:::['2-21-89']
let's go down there and get your hat back.:::['2-21-90']
forget it. it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now.:::['2-21-91']
hey. i went up! - what?:::['2-21-92']
my stock, meg, it went up two points.:::['2-21-93']
do you realize that if i'd invested my $127 in myself yesterday......that i'd, like, have a lot more than that today.:::['2-21-94']
you know what? i'm gonna do it.:::['2-21-95']
do what? - put all my money in me.:::['2-21-96']
you don't know a thing about the stock market.:::['2-21-97']
what's to know? buy, sell. high, low. bears, bulls.:::['2-21-98']
yes, manhattan.:::['2-21-99']
telephone number to the stock......selling store.:::['2-21-100']
see? didn't i tell you these pillows would be a good idea?:::['2-21-101']
for the first time in my life, i'm gonna say, "hi, birth father!":::['2-21-104']
we love you. we're here for you. - good luck.:::['2-21-105']
hey, rach, you, uh, want some sandwich?:::['2-21-107']
oh, what is in that?:::['2-21-108']
olive loaf and ham spread. no mayo.:::['2-21-109']
no, because mayo, that would make it gross.:::['2-21-110']
hey, hey... no, oh, oh, oh.:::['2-21-111']
run, phoebe, run. - no, no, doggy, please!:::['2-21-112']
i do so want to love all animals. please, no. back off!:::['2-21-113']
you got a bone? - are you kidding?:::['2-21-114']
look, kibbles! bits, oh!:::['2-21-115']

okay. all right. we have a problem.:::['2-21-118']
why don't you take his trampoline?:::['2-21-119']
okay, here, i know what we can do.:::['2-21-120']
hey. hey. hey, no!:::['2-21-121']
okay, doggy, get the sandwich! aah!:::['2-21-122']
go get the sandwich! good doggy. get the sandwich!:::['2-21-123']
the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich.:::['2-21-124']
lf he's not gonna eat it, i will. - are you crazy?:::['2-21-126']
pheebs, he's just a little dog. aah!:::['2-21-127']
hey. - what?:::['2-21-128']
do you have to be a century 21 real-estate agent......to get to wear those cool jackets?:::['2-21-129']
do you say this stuff to girls?:::['2-21-130']
hey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?:::['2-21-131']
and look where they're sitting.:::['2-21-132']
you're joking, right? you guys just walked through the door.:::['2-21-133']
maybe we didn't make it clear enough. - yeah.:::['2-21-134']
this couch belongs to us.:::['2-21-135']
i'll tell you what, you call the couch......and then we'll call the couch......and we'll see who it comes to.:::['2-21-136']
you know what i keep wondering? why you two are still sitting here.:::['2-21-137']
i have had enough of this, all right?:::['2-21-139']
these guys are trying to take our seat.:::['2-21-141']
fellas, these guys were here first.:::['2-21-142']
oh, sorry, didn't realize. - ahem.:::['2-21-143']
thank you, gunther.:::['2-21-145']
we didn't want to have to go and do that.:::['2-21-146']
he told on us?:::['2-21-147']
you told on us?:::['2-21-148']
well, pal, you didn't give me much of a choice.:::['2-21-149']
don't play with his thing. - i know.:::['2-21-150']
let's take this outside.:::['2-21-152']
"let's take this outside"?:::['2-21-153']
who talks like that?:::['2-21-154']
the guy who's about to kick your ass talks like that.:::['2-21-155']
you had to ask. - yeah.:::['2-21-156']
okay, okay, look. see......the thing is, we're not gonna fight you guys.:::['2-21-157']
here's the deal.:::['2-21-158']
you won't have to, so long as you never ever show your faces here again.:::['2-21-159']
i think you played the gunther card too soon.:::['2-21-160']
hey, pheebs, i think you're good to go.:::['2-21-161']
yeah, i don't know.:::['2-21-162']
i just think that this was a really bad sign.:::['2-21-164']
like the beast at the threshold.:::['2-21-165']
it's just i have no family left, except for my grandmother.:::['2-21-166']
but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever.:::['2-21-167']
despite what she says.:::['2-21-168']
and i have a sister who i've barely spoken to since we shared a womb.:::['2-21-169']
i don't know. this is my real father......and i want things to be, like, just right.:::['2-21-170']
i completely understand.:::['2-21-171']
yeah, whatever you need.:::['2-21-172']
hey, you want to go home?:::['2-21-173']
okay, thanks. sorry again.:::['2-21-174']
uh, i'm guessing the threshold's clear now.:::['2-21-176']
i want to buy five shares of sgj. now.:::['2-21-177']
come on, time is money, my friend!:::['2-21-178']
thank you! whoo!:::['2-21-179']
"time is money, my friend"?:::['2-21-180']
you missed "takes money to make money"......and "don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.":::['2-21-181']
i made $17 before breakfast. what have you done?:::['2-21-182']
i had breakfast here, so technically i saved $3.50.:::['2-21-183']
how did you make $17?:::['2-21-184']
well, my financially challenged friends......i split my money and i bought some shares of chp and zxy.:::['2-21-185']
how come those?:::['2-21-186']
well, chp because i used to have a crush on erik estrada.:::['2-21-187']
and zxy because i think it sounds "zexy.":::['2-21-188']
ahem, what happened to meg?:::['2-21-189']
meg was good for me, but i dumped her.:::['2-21-190']
my motto is, "get out before they go down.":::['2-21-191']
that is so not my motto.:::['2-21-192']
hey. rachel: hey, pheebs.:::['2-21-193']
oh, hey, how's the dog? - yeah.:::['2-21-194']
okay. i talked to the vet. people are so nice upstate.:::['2-21-195']
he said the little fella's gonna be okay, and i can get him tomorrow.:::['2-21-196']
joey: good. - oh, thank god.:::['2-21-197']
but he did have to have a bunch of stitches.:::['2-21-198']
and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back.:::['2-21-199']
so still hoping.:::['2-21-200']
now are you gonna call your dad to let him know that his dog is okay?:::['2-21-201']
i don't want to meet my father over the phone.:::['2-21-202']
what will i say, "hi, i'm the daughter you abandoned.:::['2-21-203']
oh, by the way, i broke your dog.":::['2-21-204']
hey, pheebs, if you want, i'll do it.:::['2-21-205']
listen, just don't say anything about me, okay?:::['2-21-207']
don't......be too long with the phone.:::['2-21-208']
she'll be a much better friend once the market closes.:::['2-21-209']
it's a woman.:::['2-21-210']
so talk to her.:::['2-21-211']
uh, hello, mrs. buffay.:::['2-21-212']
i know where your dog is.:::['2-21-213']
i want you to know he'll be returned to you almost as good as new......within 24 hours.:::['2-21-214']
uh, goodbye.:::['2-21-215']
why the voice? - hard to say.:::['2-21-216']
your cappuccino, sir.:::['2-21-217']
this is better than the coffeehouse. - absolutely.:::['2-21-219']
how come it's not mixing with the water?:::['2-21-220']
the package says to keep it moving.:::['2-21-221']
stir and drink, never let it settle.:::['2-21-222']
joey: this is ridiculous.:::['2-21-223']

i don't want to have to have joey with me every time i want decent coffee.:::['2-21-228']
and i don't want to drink cappuccino with a "k.":::['2-21-229']
i say you and i go and stand up to those guys.:::['2-21-230']
all right, hang on a second there, custer.:::['2-21-231']
ross, have you ever been beaten up before?:::['2-21-232']
by someone besides monica? - no.:::['2-21-234']
so what?:::['2-21-235', '3-11-325']
so we get beaten up. maybe that's something a man has to go through.:::['2-21-236']
like a rite of passage or something.:::['2-21-237']
couldn't we just lose our virginities again?:::['2-21-238']
because i think actually mine's growing back.:::['2-21-239']
i need $100. - what?:::['2-21-240']
hi. welcome home.:::['2-21-241']
i need $100. - for what?:::['2-21-242']
to get back in the game. - when did you get out?:::['2-21-243']
i lost it all, i lost it. - oh, no.:::['2-21-244']
i've come to terms with it, you have to too.:::['2-21-245']
look, uh, mon, i'm really sorry.:::['2-21-247']
where are we on the $100?:::['2-21-248']
i don't have it.:::['2-21-249']

otherwise, i'll have to take that diner job.:::['2-21-251']
you know, with the dancing and the costumes.:::['2-21-252']
i don't want to have to wear flame-retardant boobs.:::['2-21-253']
nobody does, honey.:::['2-21-254']
noodle!:::['2-21-256']
oh, my god. what the hell happened to my dog?:::['2-21-257']
and the woman who did this would never hurt a dog on purpose.:::['2-21-259']
she's a vegetarian.:::['2-21-260']
are these stitches?:::['2-21-261']
yeah, eight of them. that's 56 to him, ha, ha.:::['2-21-262']
if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long......because that cone will fill up fast.:::['2-21-263']
well, uh, thanks for bringing back what's left of him.:::['2-21-264']
is frank home? - how do you know frank?:::['2-21-265']

yeah. frank.:::['2-21-267']
frank: yeah.:::['2-21-268']
oh, okay, um, i mean frank senior.:::['2-21-270']

he left four years ago. we're expecting him back any minute.:::['2-21-273']
i'm sorry about the dog. everything.:::['2-21-275']
hey, lady!:::['2-21-277', '5-23-226']
hey, wait up!:::['2-21-278']
how do you know my dad? - um, well, i don't really.:::['2-21-279']
just genetically.:::['2-21-280']
he's kind of my dad too.:::['2-21-281']
heavy.:::['2-21-282']
so, um, did he ever talk about me? phoebe?:::['2-21-284']
no, but he didn't really talk about anything.:::['2-21-285']
except stilts.:::['2-21-287']
stilts? - yeah, he loved stilts.:::['2-21-288']
one time, i was upstairs stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse......and, uh, all of a sudden i look over......and there's dad's head, bobbing past the window.:::['2-21-289']
he just had this big smile on his face and he was waving......because he was happiest when he was on his stilts.:::['2-21-290']
wow. - yeah.:::['2-21-291']
i don't know what to do with that.:::['2-21-292']
me neither, ha, ha. - ha, ha.:::['2-21-293']
so are you, like, my big sister? - yeah.:::['2-21-294']
this is huge. you can buy me beer, ha, ha.:::['2-21-295']
i'm not gonna. - oh.:::['2-21-296']
but you know what's cool? if you had a friend named pete, i could say::::['2-21-297']
"i know pete. he's friends with my brother.":::['2-21-298']
i got a friend named mark. - that'll work too.:::['2-21-299']
cool. all right.:::['2-21-300']
so maybe, you know, i could give you a call sometime.:::['2-21-301']
we could talk or something.:::['2-21-302']
yeah, that'd be okay. - all right.:::['2-21-303']
i'm in the book.:::['2-21-304']
okay, yeah. - okay, all right.:::['2-21-305']
so, um, stilts, huh?:::['2-21-306']
if you want, i can show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter.:::['2-21-307']
we did it. we're here. we are standing our ground.:::['2-21-309']
how long does coffee take? - would you come on? come on!:::['2-21-310']
there we go. - i think we proved our point.:::['2-21-312']
you burn your mouth? - cannot feel my tongue.:::['2-21-313']
bullies! big bullies!:::['2-21-314']
oh, look who's here. it's the weenies.:::['2-21-315']
did we not make ourselves clear the other day?:::['2-21-316']
that's why we're here.:::['2-21-317']
yes, we're standing our ground.:::['2-21-318']
apparently.:::['2-21-319']
let's do this already. ross: whoa, whoa.:::['2-21-320']
you got a weapon?:::['2-21-321']
a nice watch. i don't want to break it on your ribs.:::['2-21-322']
question: if i don't care about my watch, can i use it as a weapon?:::['2-21-324']
what do you mean? - it's sharp, it's metal.:::['2-21-325']
i think i can do some serious damage with it.:::['2-21-326']
no, you can't use your watch.:::['2-21-327']
or your keys. - okay.:::['2-21-329']
here's what we'll do.:::['2-21-330']
we'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there.:::['2-21-331']
all right? - all right.:::['2-21-332']
all right, come on, man. let's do it!:::['2-21-333']
before i forget, are we hitting faces?:::['2-21-334']
of course. why wouldn't you hit faces?:::['2-21-335']
i have to work on monday. i have a big presentation.:::['2-21-336']
actually, i gotta show this apartment tomorrow......and, uh, this no-faces thing might not be a bad idea.:::['2-21-337']
okay, nothing from the neck up.:::['2-21-338']
or the waist down.:::['2-21-340']
dana's ovulating. - oh, really? you guys trying again?:::['2-21-341']
let me get this straight. we're talking about the middle?:::['2-21-343']

those guys are taking our stuff!:::['2-21-347']
ross: hey, hey!:::['2-21-348']
god, that was amazing. that was incredible.:::['2-21-349']
you guys kicked butt! - us? what about you guys?:::['2-21-350']
you really, bing, gave it to old mr. clean back there.:::['2-21-351']
he was a big guy. - yeah, he was, wasn't he?:::['2-21-352']
i wouldn't know, having missed everything.:::['2-21-353']
oh, don't do that to yourself.:::['2-21-354']
any one of us could have tripped over that little girl's jump rope.:::['2-21-355']
so listen, guys, are we, uh?:::['2-21-356']
are we okay here?:::['2-21-357']
we're okay. - ha, ha, all right.:::['2-21-358']

spanish midgets wrestling...:::['2-5-2']
julie. okay, yes, i see how you got there.:::['2-5-3']
you ever figure out what that thing's for?:::['2-5-4']
no, see, i'm trying this screening thing.:::['2-5-5']
i figure if i always answer the phone, people will think i don't have a life.:::['2-5-6']
my god. rodrigo never gets pinned.:::['2-5-7']
joey: here comes the beep. you know what to do.:::['2-5-8', '2-5-245', '2-5-342']
jade: hello. i'm looking for bob.:::['2-5-9']
this is jade.:::['2-5-10']
i don't know if you're still at this number, but i was just thinking about us......and how great it was, and, well, i know it's been three years......but i was kind of hoping we could hook up again.:::['2-5-11']
you know, i barely had the nerve to make this call......so you know what i did? - what?:::['2-5-12']
i got a little drunk......and naked.:::['2-5-13']
bob here.:::['2-5-14', '2-5-249']
friends s02e05: the one with five steaks and an eggplant:::['2-5-15']
so, uh, what have you been up to?:::['2-5-27']
jade: oh, you know, the usual.:::['2-5-28']
teaching aerobics......partying way too much. heh.:::['2-5-29']
oh, and in case you were wondering......those are my legs on the new james bond poster.:::['2-5-30']
can you hold on a moment? i have another call.:::['2-5-31']
i love her. - i know.:::['2-5-32']
i'm back. jade: so are we gonna get together?:::['2-5-33']
uh, absolutely.:::['2-5-34']
uh, how about tomorrow afternoon?:::['2-5-35']
do you know, uh, central perk in the village? say, five-ish?:::['2-5-36']
jade: great. i'll see you then. - okay.:::['2-5-37']
having a phone has finally paid off.:::['2-5-39']
even though you do do a good bob impression......i'm thinking when she sees you tomorrow......she's probably gonna realize, hey, you're not bob.:::['2-5-40']
i am hoping that when bob doesn't show up......she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.:::['2-5-41']
oh, my god. you are pure evil.:::['2-5-42']
okay, pure evil......horny and alone.:::['2-5-43']
i've done this.:::['2-5-44']
yeah, yeah, everybody's here.:::['2-5-45']
hey, everybody. say hi to julie in new mexico.:::['2-5-46']
all: hi, julie.:::['2-5-47']
rachel: hi, julie.:::['2-5-48']
okay. while ross is on the phone......everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.:::['2-5-49']
um, is there any chance that you're rounding up from......you know, from like 20?:::['2-5-50']
hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert and the cake.:::['2-5-51']
do we need a cake?:::['2-5-52']
look, i know it's a little steep.:::['2-5-53']
whoosh.:::['2-5-54', '3-7-64']
but it's ross.:::['2-5-55']
yeah, it's ross. joey: yeah, you're right.:::['2-5-56']
all right? okay. i'll see you later. i gotta go......do a thing.:::['2-5-57']
okay, sweetheart, i'll call you later tonight.:::['2-5-58']
whoa, whoa, whoa. hey, you're not really going through with this, are you?:::['2-5-59']
you know, i think i might just.:::['2-5-60']
so, uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?:::['2-5-61']
well, i guess i gotta start saving up for ross' birthday.:::['2-5-62']
so i guess i'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.:::['2-5-63']
can you believe how much this is gonna cost?:::['2-5-64']
do you guys ever get the feeling that, um......chandler and those guys......just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?:::['2-5-65']
yes. rachel: really?:::['2-5-66']
it's like they're always saying, "let's go here, let's go there.":::['2-5-67']
like we can afford to go here and there. - yeah.:::['2-5-68']
yes, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know?:::['2-5-69']
it's not like we can say anything about it, because, like, this is a birthday thing......you know, and it's for ross.:::['2-5-70']
for ross. - for ross.:::['2-5-71']
hi. - what?:::['2-5-73']
okay. i'm at work......just an ordinary day, you know, chop, chop, sauté, sauté.:::['2-5-74']
all of a sudden, leon, the manager, calls me into his office.:::['2-5-75']
turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.:::['2-5-76']
if it's not you, this is a horrible story.:::['2-5-77']
fortunately, it is me. - oh.:::['2-5-78']
and they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much.:::['2-5-79']
that's so cool.:::['2-5-80']
anyway, i just ran into chandler and ross. we should go out and celebrate.:::['2-5-81']
you know, someplace nice.:::['2-5-82']
someplace nice. rachel: yeah.:::['2-5-83']
how much you think i can get for my kidney?:::['2-5-84']
i'm telling you, you can't do this.:::['2-5-85']
oh, come on, i can't get a girl like that with conventional methods.:::['2-5-86']
that doesn't matter.:::['2-5-87']
she wanted to call bob.:::['2-5-88']
hey, for all we know, bob is who she was meant to be with.:::['2-5-89']
you may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.:::['2-5-90']
we don't know bob.:::['2-5-91']
okay? we know me. we like me. please let me be happy.:::['2-5-92']
go over there and tell that woman the truth.:::['2-5-93']
listen, i have to, uh, ahem...:::['2-5-98']
i have to confess something.:::['2-5-99']
whoever stood you up is a jerk.:::['2-5-101']
how did you... - i don't know.:::['2-5-102']
i just had this weird sense. you know? but that's me, i'm weird and sensitive.:::['2-5-103']
tissue?:::['2-5-104']
no, no, you keep the pack.:::['2-5-106']
i'm all cried out today.:::['2-5-107']
here is to my sister, the newly appointed head lunch chef.:::['2-5-109']
who is also in charge of purchasing.:::['2-5-110']
newly appointed head lunch chef, also in charge of purchasing...:::['2-5-111']
who has her own little desk when roland's not there.:::['2-5-112']
uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when roland's not there......here's to my little sister... - oh, wait. and i got a beeper.:::['2-5-113']
that's fine, i'll just wait. - aw, sorry.:::['2-5-115']
joey: oh, sorry, sorry.:::['2-5-116']
are we ready to order?:::['2-5-118']
oh. you know, we haven't even looked yet.:::['2-5-119']
well, when you do, just let me know.:::['2-5-120']
i'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.:::['2-5-121']
wow, look at these prices.:::['2-5-122']
yeah, these are pretty "cha-ching.":::['2-5-123']
i know. what are these, famous chickens?:::['2-5-124']
sorry i'm late. congratulations, mon. - thanks.:::['2-5-125']
i'm not sorry i'm late. how incredible was my afternoon with jade?:::['2-5-126']
well, pretty incredible, according to the message she left on my machine.:::['2-5-127']
hey, chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?:::['2-5-128']
see, i had to tell her that my number was your number.:::['2-5-129']
i couldn't tell her my number was my number......because she thinks my number is bob's number.:::['2-5-130']
hey, tell me again. what do i do when mr. roper calls?:::['2-5-131']
do i dare ask?:::['2-5-132']
yes, i'll start with the carpaccio, and then i'll have the grilled prawns.:::['2-5-133']
that sounds great, same for me. and for the gentleman?:::['2-5-134']
yeah, i'll have the thai chicken pizza.:::['2-5-135']
but, hey, look, if i get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff......is it cheaper?:::['2-5-136']
you'd think, wouldn't you?:::['2-5-137']
miss? - okay.:::['2-5-138']
i will have the, uh... side salad.:::['2-5-139']
and what would that be on the side of?:::['2-5-140']
why don't you just put it right here next to my water?:::['2-5-142']
and for you?:::['2-5-143']
um, i'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup......and, um......take care.:::['2-5-144']
i will have the, uh, cajun catfish. - anything else?:::['2-5-145']
yes, how about a verse of "killing me softly"?:::['2-5-146']
you're gonna sneeze in my fish, aren't you?:::['2-5-147']
ross: plus tip, divided by six...:::['2-5-148']
okay, everyone owes 28 bucks.:::['2-5-149']
um, everyone?:::['2-5-150']
oh. you're right, i'm sorry.:::['2-5-151']
it's monica's big night. she shouldn't pay.:::['2-5-153']
ross: so five of us is......33.50 apiece.:::['2-5-155']
no. uh-uh. no way. sorry, not gonna happen.:::['2-5-156']
whoa. whoa. prom night flashback.:::['2-5-157']
sorry, monica. i'm really happy you got promoted......but cold cucumber mush for 30-something bucks?:::['2-5-158']
rachel just had that little salad......and joey with his, like, teeny pizza.:::['2-5-160']
okay, pheebs.:::['2-5-161', '5-22-312']
how about we'll each just pay for what we had, okay?:::['2-5-162']
it's no big deal. - not for you.:::['2-5-163']
okay, look, i really don't wanna get into this right now.:::['2-5-165']
it'll just make everybody uncomfortable. - oh, fine. all right, fine.:::['2-5-166']
what? whoa, whoa. - you can tell us.:::['2-5-167']
yeah, hello? it's us. all right? we'll be fine.:::['2-5-168']
ahem. okay, um...:::['2-5-170']
uh, we three feel like that, uh, ahem......sometimes you guys don't get that, uh, ahem...:::['2-5-171']
we don't have as much money as you.:::['2-5-172']
okay. - i hear you.:::['2-5-173']
we can talk about that.:::['2-5-174']
well, then......let's.:::['2-5-175']
well, um, i guess i just never think of money as an issue.:::['2-5-176']
that's because you have it. - that's a good point.:::['2-5-177']
so, um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?:::['2-5-178']
because it's always something, you know? like with monica's new job......or the whole ross' birthday hoopla.:::['2-5-179']
what? whoa, hey.:::['2-5-180']
i don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative...:::['2-5-181']
there's gonna be a hoopla?:::['2-5-182']
basically there's the thing, and then the stuff after the thing and it's...:::['2-5-183']
if it makes anybody feel better, we can just forget the thing......and we'll just do the gift.:::['2-5-184']
gift? the thing's not the gift?:::['2-5-185']
no, the thing was we were gonna go see hootie and the blowfish.:::['2-5-186']
hootie and the... oh, my... i can catch them on the radio.:::['2-5-187']
no. now i feel bad. you wanna go to the concert.:::['2-5-188']
no, look, hey, it's my birthday......and the important thing is that we all be together.:::['2-5-189']
all of us. - together.:::['2-5-190']
not at the concert.:::['2-5-191']
okay. thank you. - thanks.:::['2-5-192']
so, the ebola virus. that's gotta suck, huh?:::['2-5-194']
gee, monica. what's in the bag?:::['2-5-195']
i don't know, chandler. let's take a look.:::['2-5-196']
oh, it's like a skit.:::['2-5-197']
why, it's dinner for six. five steaks......and an eggplant for phoebe.:::['2-5-198']
we switched meat suppliers at work, and they gave me the steaks as a thank-you.:::['2-5-199']
but wait, there's more. hey, chandler, what is in that envelope?:::['2-5-200']
by the way, this didn't seem so dorky out in the hall.:::['2-5-201']
why, it's six tickets to hootie and the blowfish.:::['2-5-203']
the blowfish.:::['2-5-204']
it's on us, all right? so don't worry. this is our treat.:::['2-5-205']
so... thank you.:::['2-5-206']
could you be less enthused?:::['2-5-207']
look, it's a nice gesture. it is.:::['2-5-208']
but it just feels like...:::['2-5-209']
like?:::['2-5-210', '4-8-75']
charity. - charity?:::['2-5-211']
we're just trying to do a nice thing here.:::['2-5-212']
but, ross, you have to understand, your nice thing makes us feel about this big.:::['2-5-213']
actually, it makes us feel that big.:::['2-5-214']
what? i don't understand. i mean, it's like we can't win with you guys.:::['2-5-215']
if you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault.:::['2-5-216']
maybe that's just how you feel.:::['2-5-217']
now you're telling us how we feel. - we never should have talked about this.:::['2-5-219']
i'm gonna pass on the concert......because i'm just not in a very hootie place right now.:::['2-5-220']
me neither. - me too.:::['2-5-221']
guys, we bought the tickets.:::['2-5-222']
well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.:::['2-5-223']
why did you look at me when you said that?:::['2-5-224']
so i guess now we can't go.:::['2-5-225']
come on, do what you want. do we always have to do everything together?:::['2-5-226']
you know what? you're right.:::['2-5-227']
fine. - fine.:::['2-5-228', '2-5-229']
fine. - all right.:::['2-5-230']
we're gonna go.:::['2-5-231']
it's not for another six hours. we're gonna go then.:::['2-5-232']
chandler? - yeah.:::['2-5-233']
oh, jeez.:::['2-5-234', '4-15-161']
are you ready? - yes.:::['2-5-235']
just let me grab my jacket and tell you i had sex today. whoa, whoa.:::['2-5-236']
what? you had sex today?:::['2-5-237']
wow. it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it.:::['2-5-238']
i was awesome, okay? she was biting her lip to stop from screaming.:::['2-5-239']
now, i know it's been a while, but i took that as a good sign.:::['2-5-241']
still doing the screening thing?:::['2-5-242']
i had sex today.:::['2-5-243']
i never have to answer that phone again.:::['2-5-244']
jade: hey, bob. it's jade.:::['2-5-246']
i just wanted to tell you i was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day.:::['2-5-247']
and just so you know, i ended up meeting a guy.:::['2-5-248']
jade: oh, hi.:::['2-5-250']
so, uh, you met someone, huh?:::['2-5-251']
jade: yes. yes, i did.:::['2-5-252']
in fact, i had sex with him two hours ago.:::['2-5-253']
so, uh, how was he?:::['2-5-254']
jade: eh...:::['2-5-255']
"eh"?:::['2-5-256']
oh, bob, he was nothing compared to you.:::['2-5-257']
i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.:::['2-5-258']
well, that makes me feel so good.:::['2-5-259']
it was just so awkward and bumpy.:::['2-5-260']
bumpy?:::['2-5-261']
maybe he had some kind of, uh, new cool style that you're not familiar with.:::['2-5-262']
and, uh, maybe you have to get used to it.:::['2-5-263']
jade: there wasn't much time to get used to it... ...if you know what i mean.:::['2-5-264']
you know what? i'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.:::['2-5-265']
yeah, i know. it's my birthday. we all should be here.:::['2-5-266']
so let's go.:::['2-5-267']
well, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.:::['2-5-268']
yeah, i mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.:::['2-5-269']
you know, the guys are probably having a great time.:::['2-5-270']
come on, you guys. one more time.:::['2-5-271']
one. - no.:::['2-5-273']
musician: thank you very much. we are hootie & the blowfish.:::['2-5-274']
that was amazing. - excellent.:::['2-5-275']
i can't believe the guys missed this.:::['2-5-276']
what guys? oh, yeah.:::['2-5-277']
excuse me. you're monica geller, aren't you?:::['2-5-278']
do i know you? - you used to be my baby-sitter.:::['2-5-279']
oh, my god. little stevie fisher?:::['2-5-280']
how have you been?:::['2-5-281', '3-4-263']
good, good. i'm a lawyer now.:::['2-5-282']
you can't be a lawyer. you're 8.:::['2-5-283']
well, listen, it was nice to see you. i gotta run backstage.:::['2-5-284']
wait, backstage? oh, yeah. my firm represents the band.:::['2-5-285']
ross. - chandler.:::['2-5-286']
look, you guys wanna meet the group? - yeah, we do.:::['2-5-287']
so, look, are you one of the ones that fooled around with my dad?:::['2-5-289']
hey, you guys. rachel: happy birthday.:::['2-5-290']
oh, thank you. thanks.:::['2-5-291']
how was your night last night?:::['2-5-293']
oh, well, it pretty much sucked. how was yours?:::['2-5-294']
yeah, ours pretty much sucked too.:::['2-5-295']
oh, but i did run into stevie fisher. remember him?:::['2-5-296']
oh, yeah. i used to baby-sit him.:::['2-5-297']
hey, how's his dad?:::['2-5-298']
uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.:::['2-5-300']
yeah, we really missed you guys.:::['2-5-301']
yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is so stupid.:::['2-5-302']
we just have to really, really not let stuff like money, get like...:::['2-5-303']
is that a hickey?:::['2-5-304']
oh, ha, ha, no, i just...:::['2-5-305']
i fell down.:::['2-5-306']
on someone's lips?:::['2-5-307']
where'd you get the hickey?:::['2-5-308']
you know, a party or... - what party?:::['2-5-309']
well, it wasn't a party so much as a... a gathering of people.:::['2-5-310']
with food and music and...:::['2-5-311']
and the band.:::['2-5-312']
you partied with hootie and the blowfish?:::['2-5-313']
yes. apparently, stevie and hootie are like this.:::['2-5-314']
who gave you that hickey?:::['2-5-315']
that would be the work of a blowfish.:::['2-5-316']
i can't believe it. i can't believe this.:::['2-5-317']
we're just sitting at home, trying to guess joey's fingers......and you guys are out, like, partying and having fun and all::::['2-5-318']
"hey, blowfish, suck on my neck.":::['2-5-319']
hey, look, don't blame us. you guys could've been there.:::['2-5-320']
oh, what? as part of your poor friends outreach program?:::['2-5-321']
oh, great. it's work.:::['2-5-322']
look, i don't know what to say. i'm sorry that we make more than you.:::['2-5-323']
but we're not gonna feel guilty about it. we work really hard for it.:::['2-5-324']
and we don't work hard?:::['2-5-325']
yeah, hi, it's monica. i got a page.:::['2-5-326']
i'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.:::['2-5-327']
oh, and you feel like we hold you back. - yes.:::['2-5-328']
monica: leon, wait. shh! guys.:::['2-5-330']
wait, i don't understand.:::['2-5-331']
those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor.:::['2-5-332']
that was not a kickback.:::['2-5-333']
come on, i'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing.:::['2-5-334']
what corporate policy?:::['2-5-335']
i just got fired.:::['2-5-338']
waitress: here's your check. that'll be 4.12.:::['2-5-339']
let me get that.:::['2-5-340']
you got 5 bucks?:::['2-5-341']
jade: hi, it's me.:::['2-5-343']
listen, bob, i'm probably way out of line here.:::['2-5-344']
i mean, it has been three years, and you're probably seeing someone else now......but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake...:::['2-5-345']
one hot, steamy, wild night...:::['2-5-346']
wow, you look nice. what's the occasion?:::['5-19-1']
monica and i are celebrating our 10-month anniversary.:::['5-19-2']
got reservations at jean-george. wow.:::['5-19-3']
how'd you get in? oh.:::['5-19-4']
made a few calls, pulled some strings......and they'll seat us if we both:::['5-19-5']
have chicken and don't get dessert.:::['5-19-6']
hi, chandler. chandler: hey, caitlin.:::['5-19-7']
somebody got a haircut.:::['5-19-8']
ugh. i hate it. i look like an 8-year-old boy.:::['5-19-9']
if that was true, gym class would've been more interesting.:::['5-19-10']
it's, uh, $27 even. oh, okay. here you go.:::['5-19-11']
where's the chicken?:::['5-19-12']
oh, it's in the back. the duck pissed him off.:::['5-19-13']
he said that eggs came first.:::['5-19-14']
ha, ha, thanks. i'll see you later. chandler: okay. bye.:::['5-19-15']
what? the flirting.:::['5-19-17']
aren't you supposed to be going out with, hmm, let's see, my sister?:::['5-19-18']
i was not flirting.:::['5-19-19', '5-19-122']
it was totally flirting! "somebody got a haircut...":::['5-19-20']
first of all, the impression? uncanny.:::['5-19-21']
second, that wasn't flirting. that was just casual conversation between two people.:::['5-19-22']
oh! yeah, right.:::['5-19-23']
you wanna see flirting? i'll show you flirting.:::['5-19-24']
i'm good. i'm okay.:::['5-19-25']
rachel: i am so proud of joey.:::['5-19-26']
he's gonna be on law and order! i know.:::['5-19-27']
but don't you think it should be called order and law?:::['5-19-28']
no, because they arrest the guy and then try him.:::['5-19-29']
yeah. don't get me started on that.:::['5-19-30']
i was not flirting. and on your anniversary. for shame!:::['5-19-31']
chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl.:::['5-19-33']
i was not. and oh, god! shh!:::['5-19-34']
i'm sorry, but you were. and besides, if anyone should be hitting on her......it's the guy who's single......the guy who can do something about it.:::['5-19-35']
sounds like someone wants to be mr. pizza delivery girl.:::['5-19-36']
is that what this is about? you like caitlin?:::['5-19-38']
ha, ha, ross, we broke up two years ago. you've been married since then.:::['5-19-39']
i think it's okay that we see other people.:::['5-19-40']
i was watching her at the pizza place. mm-hm.:::['5-19-41']
and she was just so sexy and funny and has the cutest little...:::['5-19-42']
we don't need her measurements. ha, ha.:::['5-19-43']
pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.:::['5-19-44']
i know she's pretty and you love her, but is she stupid?:::['5-19-45']
she forgot my vegetarian.:::['5-19-46']
this is perfect. she'll have to come back here with your pizza.:::['5-19-47']
and when she does, i will turn on the charm "au" ross.:::['5-19-48']
oh, i am so glad you don't eat meat. ha, ha.:::['5-19-49']
see? vegetarianism benefits everyone. mm.:::['5-19-50']
hey, everybody, look who's here! you remember my grandmother.:::['5-19-51']
big night! yeah, it's so cool.:::['5-19-52']
joey on law and order. you must be very proud.:::['5-19-53']
chandler, she doesn't understand a word of english.:::['5-19-54']
ha, ha, i thought you were joey's other grandmother.:::['5-19-55']
i've done it again.:::['5-19-56']
nonnie's my biggest fan.:::['5-19-57']
she's the only one in the family who's always believed in me.:::['5-19-58']
big star.:::['5-19-59']
my big fat joey star.:::['5-19-60']
yeah, i weighed, like, 27 pounds when i was born.:::['5-19-62']
happy anniversary. happy anniversary, 10 months.:::['5-19-64']
oh! mm. mm.:::['5-19-65']
um, in the shower i was thinking about our first night in london.:::['5-19-66']
oh, uh, joey's grandmother's right there.:::['5-19-67']
the one who speaks english? the one who doesn't.:::['5-19-68']
that was some hot love you gave me. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-19-69']
i'll get ready. wear those earrings i got you.:::['5-19-70']
oh, that's a great idea. i was saving them for something special.:::['5-19-71']
you've got to go home. but i like it here.:::['5-19-73']
go home and get the earrings you borrowed. he wants me to wear them.:::['5-19-74']
i think they're in my purse. go get dressed and i'll look for them.:::['5-19-75']
ahem, rach. hi.:::['5-19-77']
i need those earrings you borrowed.:::['5-19-78']
yeah, i'll be right back. phoebe: okay.:::['5-19-81']

here you go. thanks. wait, where's the other one?:::['5-19-84']
oh, what, you want both of them? ha, ha.:::['5-19-85']
rachel karen green, where's the other earring?:::['5-19-86']
okay, okay. look, just don't freak out, but i kind of lost it.:::['5-19-87']
oh, i know it's in the apartment, but i definitely lost it.:::['5-19-88']
what'll i tell monica? she wants to wear them tonight.:::['5-19-89']
tell her to wear her own earrings. these are her earrings.:::['5-19-90']
you lent me monica's earrings? i'm not allowed to borrow her stuff.:::['5-19-92']
why not? because i lose her stuff!:::['5-19-93']
he, uh, left a little after 2.:::['5-19-94']
you see that blind guy right there? i'm gonna bash his head in later.:::['5-19-95']
oh, uh, my big scene's coming up. uh, the big scene coming up.:::['5-19-96']
if you said, "big lima bean bubbling up," would she know the difference?:::['5-19-97']
rach, what are you doing?:::['5-19-98']
oh, i just can't watch. it's too scary.:::['5-19-99']
huh. it's a diaper commercial.:::['5-19-100']
oh, yeah, well, you know me. babies, responsibilities...:::['5-19-101']
caitlin: pizza delivery. i'll get it! i will get that!:::['5-19-102']
caitlin: hi. hi.:::['5-19-103']
one vegetarian pizza. it's 12.50. ah.:::['5-19-104']
uh, by the way, if it makes you feel any better, uh......i happen to like 8-year-old boys.:::['5-19-105']
oh, i mean... no, no, no. the, uh...:::['5-19-107']
your hair. before. your hair.:::['5-19-108']
you said you thought your hair looked like an 8-year-old boy's......and i'm just saying i like it.:::['5-19-109']
the hair.:::['5-19-110']
you understand, i don't actually like 8-year-old boys.:::['5-19-112']
all i'm looking for is the money.:::['5-19-113']
here you go. now, stop bringing us pizzas, you.:::['5-19-114']
i'm gonna try. ha, ha. chandler: okay.:::['5-19-115']
you couldn't let me have her, could you?:::['5-19-117']
what? this is a girl i really like......and you had to swoop in there!:::['5-19-118']
chandler was flirting with the hot delivery girl.:::['5-19-120']
thank you for that.:::['5-19-121']
it's okay. i don't care. ha, ha. it's fine.:::['5-19-123']
it's no big deal. i do it all the time.:::['5-19-125']
so, uh... ahem. you flirt with guys all the time?:::['5-19-126']
sure. it doesn't mean anything. just like i know it doesn't mean anything with you.:::['5-19-127']
but there's a big difference. you're a lot hotter.:::['5-19-128']
true story.:::['5-19-129']
ha, ha. this actually bothers you?:::['5-19-130']
yes, and i think it'd bother a lot of people.:::['5-19-131']
when you were going out with ross, did it bother you when he flirted with other women?:::['5-19-132']
uh, no. no, it bothered me when he slept with other women.:::['5-19-133']
and thank you for that.:::['5-19-134']
but i never had anything to worry about.:::['5-19-135']
ross was never very good at the flirting thing.:::['5-19-136']
what...? what...? ha, ha.:::['5-19-137']
what are you talking about? it worked with you.:::['5-19-138']
oh. no, you're right.:::['5-19-139']
we met, you flirted and then, bam, nine years later, you had me.:::['5-19-140']
you know what i'm gonna do? i am gonna order another pizza.:::['5-19-142']
and when caitlin gets here......i will show you how well i flirt.:::['5-19-143']
i will get her phone number. oh, well...:::['5-19-144']
and not the one on the menu.:::['5-19-145']
i found it. oh, thank god! where was it?:::['5-19-146']
on your dresser.:::['5-19-147']
okay, that is the one we already have. oh.:::['5-19-148']
okay, here's my big scene. my big scene's here.:::['5-19-149']
what do you bet nobody heard anything? no bet.:::['5-19-150']
briscoe: anybody home?:::['5-19-151']
okay, everybody just keep smiling. it'll kill my grandmother if she finds out. ha, ha.:::['5-19-153']
oh, what is it? uh, they cut me out of the show.:::['5-19-154']
are you sure? maybe your scene's coming up.:::['5-19-156']
joey: not likely. because you see that body bag right there?:::['5-19-157']
rachel: yeah. i'm in it.:::['5-19-158']
this is terrible. what'll you do?:::['5-19-159']
i don't know. but this little old lady lives for my career.:::['5-19-160']
when they dumped me off days of our lives, she almost died.:::['5-19-161']
you're not smiling. not that face! smile, everybody smile! ha, ha.:::['5-19-163']
why don't you just tell her what happened? it's not your fault.:::['5-19-164']
if we keep talking this way, aren't we gonna freak her out soon?:::['5-19-165']
oh, uh, soon. i'm gonna be on soon.:::['5-19-166']
there i am!:::['5-19-167']
nonnie: no.:::['5-19-168']
sam waterston!:::['5-19-169']
oh, no, no. that's me. that's me!:::['5-19-170']
no. sam waterston.:::['5-19-171']
crime misdemeanor, capricorn one.:::['5-19-172']
she doesn't know "hello," but she knows capricorn one.:::['5-19-173']
phoebe. hmm?:::['5-19-174']
i need those earrings. we're leaving when the show's over.:::['5-19-175']
but i already gave them back to you.:::['5-19-176']
all right, i already didn't gave them back to you. that's what i said.:::['5-19-178']
ahem. where's that other earring?:::['5-19-179']
it's not here, pheebs. it's not here. oh!:::['5-19-180']
i went to chandler's last night.:::['5-19-181']
make sure you check chandler's jewelry box.:::['5-19-182']
wait a minute, chandler has a jewelry box?:::['5-19-183']
okay, we have 10 minutes. do you want me to get into that now?:::['5-19-184']
how's that, uh......vegetarian pizza:::['5-19-186']
working out for you, huh?:::['5-19-187']
you and those, uh, vegetables have a real, uh......thing going on, huh?:::['5-19-188']
why are you being weird?:::['5-19-189']
do you like it?:::['5-19-190']
no. that would be, "why are you being cute?":::['5-19-191']
okay. i'm working on my flirting.:::['5-19-192']
oh! i did not get that.:::['5-19-193']
so, uh, monica, do you like law and order?:::['5-19-194']
yeah, it's good. oh.:::['5-19-195']
i found out all this stuff about you. you like law and order......and you've flirted with every guy:::['5-19-196']
in the tri-state area.:::['5-19-197']
shh. shh.:::['5-19-198', '3-25-199']
okay, let me get this straight.:::['5-19-199']
it's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?:::['5-19-200']
oh, i'm so glad we cleared that up.:::['5-19-201']
look, i'm sorry, but some things are different for men and women.:::['5-19-202']
go on, teach me about men and women.:::['5-19-203']
okay. i've already taught you so much already, but whatever.:::['5-19-204']
when you flirt with a guy, you think, "no big deal.":::['5-19-205']
but the guy thinks, "finally! somebody who wants to sleep with me.":::['5-19-206']
no way! it's true.:::['5-19-207']
well, that's pathetic. again, true.:::['5-19-208']
this goes for all guys? all guys that are awake.:::['5-19-209']
then we go to sleep.:::['5-19-210']
all guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way.:::['5-19-211']
all right. it's another commercial and i still haven't told her.:::['5-19-212']
joey, this is the last commercial.:::['5-19-213']
you got, like, 10 minutes left. i know!:::['5-19-214']
what am i gonna do? oh!:::['5-19-215']
you are not gonna run out and leave her here.:::['5-19-216']
yeah, all right. oh!:::['5-19-217']
uh, joey's gonna be right back. right back?:::['5-19-219']
meanwhile, let's talk about you.:::['5-19-220']
so, you're old and small.:::['5-19-221']
but i found my sunglasses.:::['5-19-222']
i've been looking for these since last summer.:::['5-19-223']
you borrowed them from me.:::['5-19-224']
okay. calm down. here they are.:::['5-19-225']
phoebe: what do we do? i don't know. i don't know!:::['5-19-227']
we'll just have to tell monica, that's all.:::['5-19-228']
oh, god! she's gonna kill me.:::['5-19-229']
oh. i could tell her it was all my fault.:::['5-19-230']
oh, that'd be great.:::['5-19-231']
mon, could i talk to you?:::['5-19-232']
yeah. what is it? um...:::['5-19-233']
i lost one of your earrings.:::['5-19-234']
i'm sorry. i am so, so sorry.:::['5-19-235']
all right, well, i mean, what can you do? if you lost it, you lost it.:::['5-19-237']
i'll replace it, i promise. i feel so terrible.:::['5-19-238']
that's fine. you didn't do it on purpose.:::['5-19-239']
no. oh.:::['5-19-240']
look at you. come here.:::['5-19-241']
you feel better? ha, ha. yeah. you're the best.:::['5-19-243']
okay, wait a minute.:::['5-19-244']
wait a minute, i can't do this.:::['5-19-245']
listen, honey, it's not phoebe's fault.:::['5-19-246']
she lent me the earrings.:::['5-19-247']

me? oh, come on, man.:::['5-24-302']
come on, buddy.:::['5-24-303']
don't let him do this. come on!:::['5-24-304']
i'm your hand twin!:::['5-24-305']
hello. one marriage, please.:::['5-24-306']
we want to get married.:::['5-24-307']
there's a service in progress. have a seat.:::['5-24-308']
"pomp and circumstance"]:::['5-24-310']
the "wedding march." does that freak you out?:::['5-24-312']
no, it's the graduation song.:::['5-24-313']
this is it. we're gonna get married.:::['5-24-315']
hello, mrs. ross!:::['5-24-317']
well, hello, mr. rachel!:::['5-24-318']
wait. okay.:::['5-24-319']
pick a card. okay.:::['5-18-0']
all right. now memorize it.:::['5-18-1']
you got it? oh, yes.:::['5-18-2']
okay. is that your card?:::['5-18-3']
yes. ha, ha.:::['5-18-4']
hey, guys. hi there.:::['5-18-5']
guess what. ben is gonna be in a tv commercial.:::['5-18-6']
what are you talking about? well, it's not for sure.:::['5-18-7']
but, uh, we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute.:::['5-18-8']
you know, which he is. um, anyhoo, he gave us his card......and told us to bring him down:::['5-18-9']
for this commercial he's auditioning.:::['5-18-10']
the guy's like the biggest commercial casting director in town.:::['5-18-12']
ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition?:::['5-18-13']
i mean, way to go, ben!:::['5-18-14']
man, i've been in that park a million times. no one's ever offered me an audition.:::['5-18-15']
i know, it's crazy. we were just pushing ben on the swings...:::['5-18-16']
i'm always on the swings.:::['5-18-17']
what am i doing wrong?:::['5-18-18']
that.:::['5-18-19']
okay, gotta go. wish me luck. joey: good luck.:::['5-18-20']
hey, rach, now that you working at ralph lauren, can you get me some shirts?:::['5-18-21']
uh, well, you know what? i don't know if i'd feel comfortable stealing......on my very first day.:::['5-18-22']
unwilling to steal from work.:::['5-18-23']
besides, if anybody is gonna get free stuff, it's me.:::['5-18-25']
okay, guys, way to wish me luck.:::['5-18-26']
joey: go get them. phoebe: bye.:::['5-18-27']
okay, let's discuss rachel's birthday.:::['5-18-28']
i say we throw a surprise party this weekend.:::['5-18-29']
whoa, whoa. but her birthday's not for another month.:::['5-18-30']
okay, but if we throw her a party on her birthday, then it's not a surprise.:::['5-18-31']
i think that's a great idea. we can have a dinner party and invite her close friends.:::['5-18-32']
ross. we're having a surprise party for rachel.:::['5-18-33']
ross: okay. done.:::['5-18-34']
okay, great. so do you wanna do it together?:::['5-18-35']
i would love to do it together.:::['5-18-36']
they're gonna do it together.:::['5-18-37']
dude, that's my girlfriend.:::['5-18-38']
so i gotta shut it down now?:::['5-18-39']
all right, i gotta take off. i'm picking up ben......and then we're off to the big audition.:::['5-18-40']
it's gonna be weird seeing some actor pretending to be ben's dad.:::['5-18-41']
yeah. weirder than his two moms making out?:::['5-18-42']
whoa, whoa. dad? there's a dad in the commercial?:::['5-18-43']
yeah. the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it.:::['5-18-44']
well, maybe i'll go with you and see if i can audition as the dad.:::['5-18-45']
i mean, who better to play ben's father than his godfather?:::['5-18-46']
you're not his godfather. what?:::['5-18-47']
okay, let's go, godfather. all right. ha, ha.:::['5-18-50']
hey, i'm in. they're gonna let me audition.:::['5-18-51']
really? that's great.:::['5-18-52']
i know, i know. one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play.:::['5-18-53']
so i steered clear of her.:::['5-18-54']
carol: that kid looks familiar. joey: oh, yeah.:::['5-18-55']
yeah, he's done tons of commercials.:::['5-18-56']
i've seen him in sugar smacks, playstation......and that one for the phone company.:::['5-18-57']
in fact, he was so good in that one......he actually convinced me:::['5-18-58']
to switch phone companies.:::['5-18-59']
chandler was mad.:::['5-18-60']
yeah, well, he's not gonna get this one. all right? ben is way cuter than that kid.:::['5-18-61']
i mean, look at him.:::['5-18-62']
listen, wouldn't it be great if i got to play ben's dad?:::['5-18-64']
joey, you look nothing like ben.:::['5-18-65']
i look more like him than you do.:::['5-18-66']
well, i really don't know you well enough for you to do that.:::['5-18-67']
so it's down to these two. nancy, i know you like this one......and i think i agree.:::['5-18-68']
rachel, what do you think?:::['5-18-69']
well, um, that one is pretty......but i just love this fabric. sorry.:::['5-18-70']
oh, don't be. that's part of your job here, to give your opinions.:::['5-18-71']
and then i take credit for them. i'm kidding. ha, ha.:::['5-18-72']
she is kidding. but don't ever disagree with her again.:::['5-18-73']
okay, now i'm kidding. oh, ha, ha.:::['5-18-74']
oh, what a fun office.:::['5-18-75']
i don't know which one. but i do know i need a cigarette.:::['5-18-76']
so, what do you say we take a break, go outside......and figure this out when we come back.:::['5-18-77']
rachel? rachel: yeah.:::['5-18-78']
you smoke? no.:::['5-18-79']
my dad's a doctor. and he would always tell me just horror stories...:::['5-18-80']
about ghosts and goblins......who totally supported:::['5-18-81']
the princess' right to smoke.:::['5-18-82']
and then they came back from smoking......and they'd made all of the decisions:::['5-18-83']
without me.:::['5-18-84']
that doesn't seem fair. rachel: i know.:::['5-18-85']
it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting, poisonous habit.:::['5-18-86']
yeah, it is the best.:::['5-18-87']
i mean, what if this keeps happening?:::['5-18-88']
they'll be outside smoking, making all the decisions......and i'll just be up in my office:::['5-18-89']
breathing in my stupid clean air.:::['5-18-90']
you know? and when kim wants to promote one of us......who do you think she's gonna pick?:::['5-18-91']
me or smokey smokerson?:::['5-18-92']
rachel, you can go down there, you don't have to smoke.:::['5-18-93']
just say you wanna get some fresh air.:::['5-18-94']
yeah, i could do that.:::['5-18-95']
yeah, or you could just do the easy thing and smoke.:::['5-18-96']
hey. do you wanna go get coffee? monica: hey.:::['5-18-97']
oh, i would love to. oh, good.:::['5-18-98']
i'm gonna go too, babe. oh, good.:::['5-18-99']
phoebe: yay. rachel & chandler: yay.:::['5-18-100']
phoebe: oh, i changed my mind.:::['5-18-101']
okay, let's talk about the party. i have so many ideas.:::['5-18-102']
ooh, me too. oh!:::['5-18-103']
yeah! oh, look at that.:::['5-18-104']
all right. this is a little sketch of the cake. uh-huh. wow.:::['5-18-105']
see? um, some sample menus.:::['5-18-106']
um, you know, i thought we'd start with a tuscan-style finger food.:::['5-18-107']
okay. and for music, here's an alphabetized list of all of my cds.:::['5-18-108']
i've highlighted the ones that'll go really good with the food.:::['5-18-109']
what happened to the dinner party? we're not doing that.:::['5-18-110']
okay? so... wow. all right.:::['5-18-111']
looks like you took care of everything. thanks a lot, cohost.:::['5-18-112']
wait. i didn't take care of everything.:::['5-18-113']
there's plenty of things for you to do.:::['5-18-114']
uh-huh? like what?:::['5-18-115']
cups. you're giving me cups?:::['5-18-117']
and ice.:::['5-18-118']
cups and ice? oh, i get to be in charge of cups and ice?:::['5-18-119']
fine. okay, i will be in charge of cups and ice.:::['5-18-121']
wait, i can get ice at the restaurant... i got it.:::['5-18-122']
hi. monica: hey.:::['5-18-123', '5-4-102', '4-11-186', '4-17-27']
how did the audition go? not so good.:::['5-18-124']
wait a minute. are you doing joey's::::['5-18-125']
"the audition didn't go so well. yeah, it did!":::['5-18-126']
yeah, i am!:::['5-18-127']
yeah, ben got a second audition. monica: oh, great.:::['5-18-128']
yeah, i had to teach ross my bit because i actually didn't get a callback.:::['5-18-129']
you got a callback too, didn't you?:::['5-18-130']
yeah, i did!:::['5-18-131']
hey, rachel. what are you doing out here?:::['5-18-132']
you know, it got kind of lonely up there, so i just thought i would come out here......and get some fresh air.:::['5-18-133']
we were talking about the fall collection.:::['5-18-134']
oh, great. so anyway, we really...:::['5-18-135']
i'm sorry. we're smoking all over you. that's okay.:::['5-18-136']
no, no, no. we'll move. you stay there.:::['5-18-137']
nancy: i sent the designs to ralph. he was excited about it.:::['5-18-138']
that's great. you are the best.:::['5-18-139']
excuse me. can i bum one of those?:::['5-18-140']
actually, this one's...:::['5-18-141']
okay, okay, okay. what's so funny over here?:::['5-18-142']
i thought you didn't smoke.:::['5-18-143']
you know, i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes.:::['5-18-144']
you know what i mean? like, doobies?:::['5-18-145']
actually, i thought to myself, "those guys are crazy.":::['5-18-146']
but no, actually, i smoke the regular ones all the time.:::['5-18-147']
we get high.:::['5-18-148']
i'm kidding. oh!:::['5-18-150']
oh, god. this is so nerve-racking. how do you do this?:::['5-18-152']
well, fortunately, i don't get many callbacks so...:::['5-18-153']
is it a good sign that they asked us to hang around after?:::['5-18-154']
who knows?:::['5-18-155']
okay. we have narrowed it down to raymond, ben, kyle and joey.:::['5-18-156']
the rest of you, thank you very much.:::['5-18-157']
yes! i knew it!:::['5-18-158']
ah. bye-bye.:::['5-18-159']
later.:::['5-18-161', '5-22-26']
this is great. i might actually get to play ben's dad.:::['5-18-162']
woman: actually, that can't happen.:::['5-18-163']
because you all have such different looks......we're putting you with raymond:::['5-18-164']
and kyle with ben.:::['5-18-165']
so it'll either be you two or you two.:::['5-18-166']
this is gonna be kind of weird. yeah, it is.:::['5-18-168']
yeah. it's gonna be weird.:::['5-18-169']
no. we're like best friends. that's why it's weird.:::['5-18-170']
i thought we were just talking.:::['5-18-172']
is it okay if i leave this stuff here till rachel's birthday party?:::['5-18-174']
uh, sure. what's in them? um, cups.:::['5-18-175']
oh, good, because we got rachel 800 gallons of water.:::['5-18-176']
seriously, that's a lot of cups.:::['5-18-177']
yeah, well, i'm in charge of cups and ice.:::['5-18-178']
and monica's gonna rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice.:::['5-18-179']
you know, i rued the day once. didn't get a whole lot else done.:::['5-18-180']
okay, time to bring up the rest of the cups.:::['5-18-181']
hey, joey. hey, pheebs.:::['5-18-182']
chandler & ross: hey. ross, good, i'm glad you're here.:::['5-18-183']
i want to talk to you about something. oh. what's up?:::['5-18-184']
well, i've been thinking about this whole commercial thing.:::['5-18-185']
you know me against ben.:::['5-18-186']
the two of us competing. well, that can't lead to anything good.:::['5-18-187']
i think i'm just gonna step aside.:::['5-18-188']
i'm gonna tell them that i won't audition.:::['5-18-189']
wow. uh...:::['5-18-190', '4-20-172']
joey, that's great. thanks, man.:::['5-18-191']
you're gonna let me do this? this is my career we're talking about here.:::['5-18-193']
but you just...:::['5-18-194']
i just said that so you wouldn't let ben do it.:::['5-18-195']
look, ross, if anyone should step aside, it should be ben.:::['5-18-196']
what? chandler, tell him.:::['5-18-197']
well, let me get the door first.:::['5-18-198']
oh, hi, no one.:::['5-18-199']
why should ben step aside?:::['5-18-200']
it was his audition in the first place. you just tagged along.:::['5-18-201']
you're like the tag-along dad.:::['5-18-202']
at least i care about his feelings.:::['5-18-203']
do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn't get it?:::['5-18-205']
and why wouldn't he get it?:::['5-18-206']
have you seen what my kid can do? huh?:::['5-18-208']
i mean, he dials phones, he eats tortilla chips.:::['5-18-209']
he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger.:::['5-18-210']
are you saying your kid eats soup better than my kid?:::['5-18-211']
you just give him a spoon, baby.:::['5-18-212']
oh, yeah? i guess we'll see. yeah.:::['5-18-213']
because this commercial belongs to me and mitch.:::['5-18-214']
your kid's name is raymond. yeah? so is yours.:::['5-18-215']
how did work go? oh, it was great. it was great.:::['5-18-216']
i went down there just like you said. and we talked business.:::['5-18-217']
and kim totally took my opinions.:::['5-18-218']
you stink.:::['5-18-219']
thanks. no, i'm serious.:::['5-18-220']
that's because i went down there and they were smoking.:::['5-18-221']
this is actually the smell of success.:::['5-18-222']
but there's something different, though.:::['5-18-223']
oh, my god. you smoked.:::['5-18-224']
i did not. yes, you did.:::['5-18-225']
you look happy and sick. you smoked.:::['5-18-226']
all right, fine. but i had to. i had to do it for my career.:::['5-18-227']
i wish i had to smoke for my career.:::['5-18-228']
that's so gross.:::['5-18-229']
well, no, it's not that bad, you know?:::['5-18-230']
i mean, yeah, my tongue feels a little fuzzy and my fingers sort of smell.:::['5-18-231']
i actually feel like i could throw up.:::['5-18-232']
but you gotta push past this, okay? because it's about to get so good.:::['5-18-233']
you smell so smoky, i gotta get up.:::['5-18-235']
i think you smell great.:::['5-18-237']
so we're decided. no on plaid, yes on pink.:::['5-18-238']
i'm so onboard.:::['5-18-240']
rachel, didn't you just light that? rachel: yeah.:::['5-18-241']
i'm just really, really trying to cut back, you know.:::['5-18-243']
good luck, rach.:::['5-18-244']
i've actually been thinking about quitting.:::['5-18-245']
oh, well, sure. every sunday night, i tell myself i'm quitting.:::['5-18-246']
every monday morning, it's like::::['5-18-247']
well, let's quit. we'll just quit. let's all quit.:::['5-18-249']
it does sound appealing.:::['5-18-250']
i never could do it. but you could. you can. absolutely.:::['5-18-251']
we can help each other out. we could get those patches.:::['5-18-252']
we could be like the patch sisters.:::['5-18-253']
you know, we really should quit. okay, let's quit.:::['5-18-254']
yes. great. give me those cigs. come on.:::['5-18-255']
give it. give it. out. done. quit. whoo!:::['5-18-256']
my late husband gave me that lighter. ha, ha.:::['5-18-257']
okay, then. okay.:::['5-18-259', '3-14-86']
mm, soup.:::['5-18-260', '5-18-289']
joey, ross is gonna be here any second.:::['5-18-261']
would you mind watching ben while i use the ladies' room?:::['5-18-262']
yeah, no problem. thanks.:::['5-18-263']
so you want to be an actor, huh? well, i gotta tell you, it's no picnic.:::['5-18-266']
there's tons of rejection. no stability.:::['5-18-267']
i mean, one day, you're dr. drake ramoray.:::['5-18-268']
the next day, you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle.:::['5-18-269']
i mean, ben. ben.:::['5-18-273']
okay, raymond, joey, you're up.:::['5-18-274']
hi. woman: okay.:::['5-18-275']
all right, well, let's try one. whenever you guys are ready.:::['5-18-276']
uh-oh. is there a problem?:::['5-18-277']
well, this is noodle soup. and i've been working with tomato.:::['5-18-278']
but that's okay. no problem. no problem.:::['5-18-279']
mm, noodle soup.:::['5-18-280', '5-18-286', '5-18-295']
you know, that's fine. but the line is, "mm, soup.":::['5-18-281']
oh. what'd i say? mm, noodle soup.:::['5-18-282']
how's that different?:::['5-18-283']
oh. right. yeah.:::['5-18-284']
all right. let's try one.:::['5-18-285']
okay. let's do it again.:::['5-18-287']
i mean, noodle soup. i mean, soup.:::['5-18-290']
you know what? we need to move on.:::['5-18-292']
oh, no, i could do it one more time.:::['5-18-293']
see, look.:::['5-18-294']
uh-oh. busted.:::['5-18-298']
come on, you guys. what are you doing?:::['5-18-299']
i thought we were the patch sisters.:::['5-18-300']
yeah, that didn't work out.:::['5-18-301']
rachel, we tried to quit. but it was too hard.:::['5-18-302']
well, if you started smoking again, you could have at least told me.:::['5-18-303']
come on, give me one of those. what are we talking about?:::['5-18-304']
no, you're doing great. don't give up.:::['5-18-305']
that's why we didn't tell you, and we are not gonna drag you down.:::['5-18-306']
oh, wait. no, no. drag me down. drag me down.:::['5-18-307']
forget it, rachel. we're both so proud of how well you're doing.:::['5-18-308']
i'm not gonna let you blow it. in fact, if i catch you, you're fired.:::['5-18-309']
so go on, get out of here. go on. i don't want you breathing this stuff. go on.:::['5-18-310']
so okay. so you'll come with me on the paris trip?:::['5-18-311']
hey, check it out. cup hat, cup banner......cup chandelier and the thing:::['5-18-313']
that started it all. the cup.:::['5-18-314']
great job with the cups, pheebs. ha, ha.:::['5-18-315']
why don't you just go out with her?:::['5-18-316']
did you notice the ice? look.:::['5-18-317']
we have it all. we have crushed, cubed and dry. watch.:::['5-18-318']
mystical.:::['5-18-320']
no one's eating my tuscan finger food. they're filling up on phoebe's snow cones.:::['5-18-321']
there are snow cones?:::['5-18-322']
snow cones. yuck.:::['5-18-323']
go, go. thank you. thank you.:::['5-18-324']
monica: look, look. group: surprise.:::['5-18-325']
what? my birthday is not for another month.:::['5-18-326']
that's the surprise.:::['5-18-327']
oh, my god, you guys. this is so great. it's so unexpected.:::['5-18-328']
i mean, chandler's birthday's even before mine.:::['5-18-329']
group: surprise.:::['5-18-330']
wow. this is so great. look at all these......cups. this is so weird.:::['5-18-331']
i was in charge of cups.:::['5-18-332']
oh, okay. not so weird.:::['5-18-333']
listen, man. i'm sorry the audition didn't go well.:::['5-18-336']
no, really. i am, joey. i feel bad.:::['5-18-338']
well, look, ross. you don't have to, okay?:::['5-18-339']
it's not your fault i suck.:::['5-18-340']
what kind of an actor can't even say, "mm, noodle soup"?:::['5-18-341']
hey, you know what? maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck.:::['5-18-342']
maybe you messed up because you care more about your godson.:::['5-18-343']
what do you mean? i think, subconsciously...:::['5-18-344']
whoa, you lost me.:::['5-18-345']
i think, on some level, you sabotaged......your own audition:::['5-18-346']
so ben would get the part.:::['5-18-347']
well, your way sounds a lot better than mine.:::['5-18-348']
yeah. it's not that i'm a bad actor. no.:::['5-18-350']
no, it's just that, uh, i care so damn much about little ben......that, uh, it was more important:::['5-18-351']
for me to see him succeed.:::['5-18-352']
there you go. thank you. thank you.:::['5-18-353']
so did he get it? no.:::['5-18-354']
ah, what are you gonna do?:::['5-18-355']
oh, hi. excuse me. is rachel green here? i'm supposed to meet her for lunch.:::['5-18-356']
oh, she doesn't come down anymore. you can find her up on 10.:::['5-18-357']
kim: so we talked about the presentation at lunch.:::['5-18-359']
he wondered if one person would be enough for me to take on the trip.:::['5-18-360']
and i said, "yeah, absolutely.":::['5-18-361']
i'll catch you guys later.:::['5-18-362']
hey, joey!:::['5-23-1']
i forgot the pin to my atm card. can you get it for me?:::['5-23-3']
phoebe: sure. where is it?:::['5-23-4']
uh, i scratched it on the atm machine on the corner.:::['5-23-5']
oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?:::['5-23-6']
that's it! thanks.:::['5-23-7']
wanna talk to chandler? let me talk to him.:::['5-23-8']
joey: he didn't believe in my movie......which is a big mistake,because it is real. real.:::['5-23-9']
i've tried to apologize.:::['5-23-10']
if i can't do it on the phone, i'll go and do it in person.:::['5-23-11']
i heard that. uh, can you put him on?:::['5-23-12']
hey. don't come out here.:::['5-23-14']
i support you 100 percent and i wanna prove that to you in person.:::['5-23-15']
i got that. i forgive you. don't come out here.:::['5-23-16']
you haven't taken my calls for a week.:::['5-23-17']
i'm totally over it. friends forever. don't come out here.:::['5-23-18']
would you mind doing a picture with us?:::['5-23-19']
uh, what was that?:::['5-23-20']
uh, entertainment tonight.:::['5-23-21']
good talking to you and don't come out here.:::['5-23-22']
i'm sorry i'm late.:::['5-23-24']
i'm so sorry. have you been here long?:::['5-23-27']
what the hell took you so long?:::['5-23-29']
you can't tell chandler. i ran into richard.:::['5-23-30']
which richard? the richard.:::['5-23-31']
richard simmons? oh, my god!:::['5-23-32']
no, my ex-boyfriend richard. you know, the tall guy, mustache.:::['5-23-33']
okay, that actually makes more sense. how was it?:::['5-23-34']
it was really nice. we talked and i had lunch with him.:::['5-23-35']
that's weird. i dreamed you had lunch with richard.:::['5-23-36']
really? again, richard simmons.:::['5-23-37']
go on.:::['5-23-38']
the strange part was he was really nice......and he looks great,but i didn't feel anything.:::['5-23-39']
so why can't we tell chandler?:::['5-23-40']
it'll freak him out and tomorrow's our anniversary. i don't wanna spoil it.:::['5-23-41']
i can't believe you guys have lasted a whole year!:::['5-23-42']
wow, i owe rachel 20 bucks.:::['5-23-43']
on a totally different bet.:::['5-23-45']
it's almost our anniversary! i know.:::['5-23-47']
one year ago today, i was just your annoying friend chandler.:::['5-23-48']
aw, now you're just my annoying friend chandler.:::['5-23-49']
huh. i got you a gift.:::['5-23-50']
it's not till tomorrow. i know, but you have to open it today.:::['5-23-51']
okay! there you go!:::['5-23-52']
it's two tickets to vegas! wow.:::['5-23-53']
yeah! for this weekend! it'll be perfect.:::['5-23-54']
you'll see joey, plus, we'll start our celebration on the plane.:::['5-23-55']
we can call it our "plane-a-versary.":::['5-23-56']
we have to?:::['5-23-57']
this is great, but joey didn't want any of us there.:::['5-23-58']
he doesn't want us to go to any trouble. he'll be excited when we surprise him.:::['5-23-59']
plus, we get to have our own "anna-vegas-ry"!:::['5-23-60']
"anna-vada-versary!":::['5-23-61']
i think we should see other people.:::['5-23-62']
we can go, right?:::['5-23-63']
great idea.:::['5-23-64']
i'm gonna go too!:::['5-23-65']
pheebs, it's kind of our anniversary.:::['5-23-66']
you won't ditch me like you did with london.:::['5-23-67']
ditch you? you were pregnant...:::['5-23-68']
uh-huh. great story. i'm going.:::['5-23-69']
listen, this weekend we're all gonna go to las vegas to surprise joey!:::['5-23-71']
including me!:::['5-23-72']
do you wanna go?:::['5-23-73']
i can take a couple days off work.:::['5-23-74']
of course you can take a couple days off, because this trip includes me!:::['5-23-75']
i've got a presentation tomorrow. i can't miss that.:::['5-23-76']
i've got tickets to the van gogh exhibit. i waited a year for this.:::['5-23-77']
rach, maybe we can fly out saturday? sounds great.:::['5-23-78']
i'll call the airlines.:::['5-23-79']
that'll be nice to have the apartment to myself.:::['5-23-80']
to walk around naked.:::['5-23-81']
no, so i can be by myself. have a little alone time.:::['5-23-82']
naked alone time.:::['5-23-83']
just because i'm alone doesn't mean i wanna walk around naked.:::['5-23-84']
you live alone, you don't walk around naked.:::['5-23-85']
uh-huh. why does it takes me so long to answer the door?:::['5-23-86']
so far, is this trip to las vegas better or worse than the trip to london?:::['5-23-87']
so far, it's pretty much the same, pheebs.:::['5-23-88']
what about after i give you these candies?:::['5-23-89']
i guess it's a little better now. phoebe: ha, ha.:::['5-23-90']
las vegas, 1. london, 0.:::['5-23-91']
i'll be back.:::['5-23-92']
happy plane-a-versary.:::['5-23-93']
aw. i love you.:::['5-23-94']
can i give you your present now? okay!:::['5-23-95']
oh, don't tell me i did this.:::['5-23-96']
i love "i forgot the present" fake-out!:::['5-23-97']
how about "i did forget the present, forgive me" not fake-out?:::['5-23-98']
you can give it to me when we get back.:::['5-23-99']
what "richard thing"?:::['5-23-102', '5-23-104']
simmons. go with simmons.:::['5-23-105']
i ran into richard yesterday.:::['5-23-106']
he asked me if i wanted to go for a bite and i did.:::['5-23-107']
i didn't tell you because you'd get mad......and i didn't wanna spoil:::['5-23-108']
our anniversary.:::['5-23-109']
i'm not mad.:::['5-23-110']
so you bumped into richard. you grabbed a "bite.":::['5-23-112']
no big deal.:::['5-23-113']
okay, london, 1.:::['5-23-115']
oh, look what happened.:::['5-23-118']
rachel: huh, check me out.:::['5-23-119']
i'm in my kitchen......naked.:::['5-23-120']
i'm picking up an orange.:::['5-23-121']
i'm naked.:::['5-23-122']
i'm lighting the candles.:::['5-23-123']
naked. and carefully.:::['5-23-124']
ross: oh, my god! that's rachel, naked!:::['5-23-125']
i can't look at that. i am looking at this.:::['5-23-126']
okay, vivid colors, expressive brush strokes.:::['5-23-127']
unless she wants me to be looking at that.:::['5-23-128']
she knows i'm home.:::['5-23-129']
she knows i can see her.:::['5-23-130']
what kind of game is she playing?:::['5-23-131']
i think maybe someone's lonely tonight.:::['5-23-132']
oh, dr. geller.:::['5-23-133']
stop it. you're being silly. ha, ha.:::['5-23-134']
or am i?:::['5-23-135']
you baby" playing over speakers]:::['5-23-136']
love to love you baby:::['5-23-137']
ow:::['5-23-138']
love to love you baby ow:::['5-23-139', '5-23-140']
darn it!:::['5-23-141']
may i come in?:::['5-23-143']
uh, yeah, if you want to.:::['5-23-144']
do you want me to?:::['5-23-145']
yeah, sure?:::['5-23-146']
so do i.:::['5-23-147', '5-14-262']
okay, rach, before anything happens......i wanna lay down a couple:::['5-23-148']
of ground rules.:::['5-23-149']
this is just about tonight.:::['5-23-150']
i won't go through with this if it'll raise the question of "us.":::['5-23-151']
i just want this to be......about what it is.:::['5-23-152']
and, um......what is that, ross?:::['5-23-153']
the physical act of love.:::['5-23-154']
so you weren't trying to entice me just now with your nakedness?:::['5-23-156']
oh, god. you saw me?:::['5-23-157']
you weren't trying to entice me with your nakedness?:::['5-23-158']
you actually thought i wanted to have sex with you?:::['5-23-160']
no, no, no, no.:::['5-23-163']
phoebe: hey, you guys, wait! you guys.:::['5-23-164']
this place is much better than london.:::['5-23-165']
a lady dressed like cleopatra gave me this.:::['5-23-166']
ninety-nine cent steak and lobster dinner. huh.:::['5-23-167']
you don't eat animals.:::['5-23-168']
for ninety-nine cents i'd eat you.:::['5-23-169']
i can totally settle down here.:::['5-23-170']
it's got everything i could ever want. including joey! look!:::['5-23-171']
look! hey!:::['5-23-172']
phoebe: hey, joey!:::['5-23-174']
phoebe: wow! hi.:::['5-23-175']
love your condoms, my man.:::['5-23-176']
why are you here? i told you not to come.:::['5-23-177']
why are you dressed as a gladiator?:::['5-23-178']
uh, because i'm shooting a scene right now. i play a gladiator.:::['5-23-179']
hold on a second. can we cut?:::['5-23-180']
my friends are here. i'm gonna take a break.:::['5-23-181']
the director.:::['5-23-183']
uh, her.:::['5-23-184']
all right, it's not a gladiator movie. i work here.:::['5-23-185']
why? what happened?:::['5-23-186']
the movie shut down. ran out of money.:::['5-23-187']
i'm working here till it starts up, if it ever does.:::['5-23-188']
monica: i'm so sorry. phoebe: such a drag.:::['5-23-189']
sorry i didn't tell you. i'm sorry.:::['5-23-190']
apparently there's a new policy of not sharing.:::['5-23-191']
i knew you weren't okay with that. so you're a gladiator!:::['5-23-192']
monica had lunch with richard. dawson?:::['5-23-194']
phoebe: no...:::['5-23-195']
but that would've been so cool!:::['5-23-196']
her boyfriend richard.:::['5-23-197']
it meant nothing. after all this time, how can you not trust me?:::['5-23-198']
when you go lunching with hunky men and don't tell me!:::['5-23-199']
you're right. i'm sorry. i should've told you.:::['5-23-200']
aw, there we go. now i love vegas.:::['5-23-202']
i promise you next time i absolutely will tell you.:::['5-23-203']
"next time"?:::['5-23-204']
there won't be a next time. you cannot see him again.:::['5-23-206']
i cannot see him? you can't tell me what to do.:::['5-23-207']
if you act like this, i won't be around you.:::['5-23-209']
fine. happy anniversary!:::['5-23-210']
guys, please! come on, come on.:::['5-23-211']
this is obviously a misunderstanding.:::['5-23-212']
no, it's not. what're you talking about?:::['5-23-213']
don't look at me. i just work here.:::['5-23-214']
okay, um, ross? i'm a little warm, so i'm gonna be taking off my sweater.:::['5-23-215']
now, i'm just letting you know......this is not an invitation:::['5-23-216']
to the physical act of love.:::['5-23-217']
yep, that's hilarious.:::['5-23-218']
i'm sorry. i'm done. i'm done.:::['5-23-219']
you know, last night was embarrassing for you too.:::['5-23-220']
no, not really.:::['5-23-221', '5-8-146']
but you know, i just don't embarrass that easily.:::['5-23-222']
what? you totally get embarrassed.:::['5-23-223']
no, i don't. ross, i think i'm just a more secure person than you are.:::['5-23-224']
is that so? yeah.:::['5-23-225']
i don't care how much you want it, okay?:::['5-23-227']
i am not gonna have sex with you in the bathroom!:::['5-23-228']
you know, in roman times, this was more than just a hat.:::['5-23-229']
yeah, sure, sure.:::['5-23-231']
they would scrub the floors.:::['5-23-232']
they'd use it to get the mud off their shoe.:::['5-23-233']
sometimes underneath the horse would get dirty.:::['5-23-234']
so they would stick it right...:::['5-23-235']
i can't believe this is how i'm spending my anniversary.:::['5-23-236']
i'll take you someplace nice. a guy tipped me $100.:::['5-23-237']
whoa! yeah.:::['5-23-238']
he was playing blackjack for an hour and he won $5000.:::['5-23-239']
if i won $5000, i'd join a gym.:::['5-23-241']
build up my upper body......and hit richard from behind:::['5-23-242']
with a stick.:::['5-23-243']
wait! why don't i just do what that guy did?:::['5-23-244']
i'll take this $100, turn it into $5000......and i'll turn that into enough:::['5-23-245']
to get my movie going!:::['5-23-246']
i don't need luck. i've thought this through. i see.:::['5-23-248']
monica: thank you. phoebe: thanks.:::['5-23-249']
i can't believe this. this is like the worst night ever.:::['5-23-250']
you had a minor setback in your relationship.:::['5-23-251']
big deal. it's only chandler.:::['5-23-252']
i am so sorry.:::['5-23-253', '5-5-259']
this is crazy having such a stupid argument.:::['5-23-254']
i don't wanna see richard.:::['5-23-255']
so go fix it.:::['5-23-256']
find chandler. he's probably in your room.:::['5-23-257']
tell him sorry and you love him.:::['5-23-258']
you're right, phoebe.:::['5-23-259']
thank you. sure.:::['5-23-260']
yeah! las vegas! number one!:::['5-23-261']
anybody lose this? coming out.:::['5-23-262']
place your bet.:::['5-23-263']
dice her out.:::['5-23-264']
yellow 11. pay the front line!:::['5-23-265']
so, uh, i'm on my way back to the bathroom.:::['5-23-267']
all right, all right. just keep walking, all right?:::['5-23-268']
what are you... i am sorry, sir.:::['5-23-269']
i think he just really likes you.:::['5-23-270']
you know that teacher who had a baby with her student?:::['5-23-272']
stewardess: can i help you? yes.:::['5-23-273']
do you have any extra pants? uh, my friend seems to have had a little accident.:::['5-23-274']
can i change 100? changing 100.:::['5-23-275']
good luck, sir. thanks.:::['5-23-276']
thirteen. hit me!:::['5-23-278']
you are not gonna believe this!:::['5-23-281']
i have found my identical hand twin.:::['5-23-282']
my identical hand twin!:::['5-23-284']
what's an identical hand twin?:::['5-23-285']
it was incredible. the dealer's hands were exactly like mine.:::['5-23-286']
it was like looking at my hands in a mirror!:::['5-23-287']
you sure you weren't looking at your hands in a mirror?:::['5-23-288']
don't you see what this means? i can forget about that stupid movie.:::['5-23-289']
i'm gonna be a millionaire!:::['5-23-290']
i don't have it all worked out yet.:::['5-23-292']
but it's gotta mean big money. come on, identical hands!:::['5-23-293']
again, i must go back to......how?:::['5-23-294']
this is vegas, man. people will pay to see freaky stuff!:::['5-23-295']
how much would you pay to see this hand......twice? huh?:::['5-23-296']
i can't really put a price on that.:::['5-23-297']
are you un-supporting me again?:::['5-23-298']
i support you 100 percent. i just didn't get it right away.:::['5-23-300']
now i'm caught up.:::['5-23-301']
identical hand twins.:::['5-23-302']
it's a million-dollar idea!:::['5-23-303']
hey! pheebs!:::['5-23-304']
i found my identical hand twin!:::['5-23-305']
oh, you're so lucky!:::['5-23-306']
so where's monica? did you guys make up?:::['5-23-307']
no. but she just came up here.:::['5-23-308']
that was joey.:::['5-23-309']
i wonder where she is? it's so weird.:::['5-23-310']
she's probably talking to richard.:::['5-23-311']
would you stop that?:::['5-23-312']
you know what she said after her lunch with richard?:::['5-23-313']
she didn't feel anything for him. she loves you.:::['5-23-314']
she feels terrible. she really wants to make up. you've gotta find her.:::['5-23-316']
i should really start wearing hats.:::['5-23-319']
stewardess: welcome to las vegas.:::['5-23-320']
did you enjoy your flight? i did.:::['5-23-321']
thank you very much. it was excellent.:::['5-23-322']
i hope you had a nice flight. oh, it was the best.:::['5-23-323']
well, my eye is a little itchy.:::['5-22-1']
uh, mine too. yeah.:::['5-22-2']
wow, it's really red. you should go see my eye doctor.:::['5-22-3']
richard? i'm not gonna go see your ex-boyfriend.:::['5-22-4']
richard, that's all i ever hear. richard, richard, richard.:::['5-22-5']
since we've been going out, i think i've mentioned his name twice.:::['5-22-6']
okay. so richard, richard.:::['5-22-7']
it's not richard, okay? it's this new guy. he's really good.:::['5-22-8']
i'm sorry. i'm not going to an eye doctor.:::['5-22-9']
oh, god. here we go. what?:::['5-22-10']
any time anything comes close to touching her eye or anyone else's......she, like, freaks out. watch.:::['5-22-11']
ross, come on.:::['5-22-12', '5-20-312']
all right, fine. i have a weird thing with my eye. can we not talk about it please?:::['5-22-13']

oh, give him a kiss for me. ross: all right. bye.:::['5-22-24']
i am so sorry you got caught in the middle of that.:::['5-22-27']
i didn't mean to be so out there, but i am furious with him.:::['5-22-28']
wow, um...:::['5-22-29']
calm down?:::['5-22-30']
i'm trying, but, man, that guy can push my buttons.:::['5-22-31']
why are you so mad at him?:::['5-22-32']
look, i don't wanna talk about it, okay? well, it seems like...:::['5-22-33']
you wanna be on my list too? keep talking.:::['5-22-34']
has anyone seen my list, by the way?:::['5-22-35']
uh, no. what's it look like?:::['5-22-36']
um, a piece of paper and it says "ross." i see.:::['5-22-37']
i just got off the phone with estelle. guess what?:::['5-22-39']
i got the lead in a movie.:::['5-22-40']
chandler: you got the lead in a movie? what's the movie about?:::['5-22-41']
oh, it's called shutterspeed. it's really cool.:::['5-22-42']
yeah, um, i meet this girl in the subway and we fall in love in, like, a day, right?:::['5-22-43']
and then she disappears. but i find out where she lives.:::['5-22-44']
and when i get there, this old lady answers the door. i say, "where's betsy?":::['5-22-45']
right? and she says, "betsy's been dead 10 years.":::['5-22-46']
ooh. chilling.:::['5-22-47']
oh, and the best part is we're filming in the desert outside of vegas.:::['5-22-48']
you know what that means, buddy. yeah, i know.:::['5-22-49']
road trip. yeah, we can rent a car. i just have to be there by tuesday.:::['5-22-50']
oh, wait. my grandmother's dead.:::['5-22-51']
well, uh, we can talk about that too, pheebs.:::['5-22-52']
no, no, her cab.:::['5-22-53']
she probably won't be using it. you could drive it to las vegas.:::['5-22-54']
all right. thanks, pheebs.:::['5-22-55']
whoa, whoa, whoa. what are we gonna do about my job?:::['5-22-56']

this is the glaucoma test. sit down. uh-huh.:::['5-22-113']

okay, so it was very, very nice to meet you, sir.:::['5-22-133']
ow! hey, what are you...? are you crazy? okay.:::['5-22-134']

i want you to take these drops for a week and you'll be as good as new.:::['5-22-136']
no, i don't put things in my eye.:::['5-22-137']
okay then. i guess we'll see you back here in three months.:::['5-22-138']
great. and i'll fit you for a glass eye.:::['5-22-139']
okay, just give me the damn drops.:::['5-22-140']
dr. miller?:::['5-22-141']

very good, monica.:::['5-22-143']
you know where they are. i sure do.:::['5-22-144']
and you don't get one.:::['5-22-145']
you know, i gotta tell you, those eye drops are a miracle.:::['5-22-146']
my eye is 100 percent better.:::['5-22-147']
they're still in my coat. damn.:::['5-22-148']
hey. hey, you ready to go?:::['5-22-149']
listen, how cold is it gonna be there?:::['5-22-150']

man, i wish ross was coming with us. i'm gonna miss him.:::['5-22-153']
thanks a lot. i just got that jerk out of my mind.:::['5-22-154']
hey, so where are we staying? is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite?:::['5-22-155']
uh, no, not really. it's an independent film.:::['5-22-156']
so we don't have a real big budget. i figured i'd just stay in your room.:::['5-22-157']
i see, but once you get your first paycheck, you'll be springing for a suite.:::['5-22-158']
lead in the movie, they must be paying you a lot.:::['5-22-159']
oh, yeah. check this out. for every dollar shutterspeed makes......one penny of it:::['5-22-160']
goes right in joey's pocket.:::['5-22-161']
so you don't get paid unless the movie makes money?:::['5-22-162']
did you not hear the plot of the movie?:::['5-22-163']
"she's been dead for 10 years.":::['5-22-164']
i'm gonna be a millionaire.:::['5-22-165']
i just wanted to say goodbye to you guys.:::['5-22-167']
and to see if maybe you guys will place a little bet for me.:::['5-22-168']
twenty bucks on black 15.:::['5-22-169']
you got it. ross: all right.:::['5-22-170']
all right. bye-bye, now. rachel: bye, you guys.:::['5-22-171']
i'm gonna say goodbye at the car. okay.:::['5-22-172']
anybody wanna say goodbye to me at the car?:::['5-22-173']
oh, honey, i'll say goodbye to you at the car if you don't mind the pus.:::['5-22-174']
but wait a minute. the pus is good. it means it's healing.:::['5-22-176']
hey, pheebs. what you reading?:::['5-22-177']
oh, i'm sorry, i didn't see you there.:::['5-22-182']
pheebs, are you mad at me or something?:::['5-22-183']
because if you are, please tell me what it is i did.:::['5-22-184']
well, if you don't know, i can't help you. well, i don't know.:::['5-22-185']

i'll, uh, see you later, okay?:::['5-22-192']
bye, fat ass. all right.:::['5-22-193']
phoebe, come on, will you please tell me what it is that made you so mad at me?:::['5-22-194']
i don't know. i don't remember.:::['5-22-195']
well, if you can't remember, can't we just forget about this?:::['5-22-196']
oh, no. i am mad at you. i know that much.:::['5-22-197']
but i am sorry about the "fat ass" thing......because you actually have:::['5-22-198']
a very sweet little heinie.:::['5-22-199']
man, i'm getting pretty tired. you might have to take over soon.:::['5-22-200']
we've been driving for a half-hour. and you haven't looked at the road once.:::['5-22-201']
don't worry. it's out there.:::['5-22-202']
maybe i just need lunch. yeah.:::['5-22-203']
you wanna eat? my treat.:::['5-22-204']
isn't that ross' money?:::['5-22-205']
ross' treat. where do you wanna eat?:::['5-22-207']
i don't know. oh, hey, i know how we can decide.:::['5-22-208']
all right, uh, i'm gonna ask you questions......and then you have to answer:::['5-22-209']
real fast, okay?:::['5-22-210']
so, uh, clear your mind. clear it right out. clear it out.:::['5-22-211']
would you rather be too wet or too dry? too dry.:::['5-22-213']
do you believe in ghosts? no.:::['5-22-214']
is this movie gonna be my big break? no.:::['5-22-215']
what? yes.:::['5-22-216']
dude, you said no. i also said yes.:::['5-22-217']
you don't think this is gonna be a big break for me?:::['5-22-218']
look, joe, i just don't want you to get your hopes up too high.:::['5-22-221']
what are you talking about? i'm the lead in a movie.:::['5-22-222']
they're not even paying you. this doesn't even sound like a real movie.:::['5-22-223']
you know, i don't know why you're dumping all over my big break.:::['5-22-224']
because, joe, i don't think this is going to be your big break.:::['5-22-225']
is that why you're on this trip? huh? to make me feel like a loser?:::['5-22-226']
because if it is, i'd rather be alone. you don't want me on the trip?:::['5-22-227']
not if you're like this.:::['5-22-228']
tell you what, the next time you ask me a question like that, i'll lie.:::['5-22-229']
yeah, i don't want you on the trip.:::['5-22-230']
all right, fine. why don't you pull over? i'll get out now.:::['5-22-231']
you're not supposed to stop on a bridge.:::['5-22-234']
get out. fine.:::['5-22-235']
chandler: wait. wait. there's no sidewalk.:::['5-22-236']
yeah. i'm gonna die here.:::['5-22-237']
okay, are you mad at me because my hair gel smells?:::['5-22-238']
are you angry with me because i said your handwriting is childlike?:::['5-22-240']
no, that made me feel precious.:::['5-22-241']
oh, i know. is it because he's always correcting people's grammar?:::['5-22-242']
you know, "whom, whom." sometimes it's "who.":::['5-22-243']
yeah? sometimes it's...:::['5-22-244']
oh, did you beat him at a board game?:::['5-22-245']
he turns into such a baby when he starts to lose.:::['5-22-246']
okay, i'm the baby. hey. stop it.:::['5-22-247']
hey. monica: what are you doing here?:::['5-22-248']
joey kicked me out of the car on the bridge.:::['5-22-249']
why? chandler: i don't know. he went crazy.:::['5-22-250']
we were playing that game where you ask a question and have to answer fast.:::['5-22-251']
oh, that game should not be played without my supervision.:::['5-22-252']
well, i don't know what made him mad.:::['5-22-253']
all i said was that, uh, i didn't think this was gonna be his big break......that this movie wasn't gonna:::['5-22-254']
do anything for him......and that it didn't sound:::['5-22-255']
like a real movie.:::['5-22-256']
okay, he should've pushed me off the bridge.:::['5-22-257']
oh, i figured you guys would all be mad at me......so i got you some gifts:::['5-22-259']
that i found on the side of the road.:::['5-22-260']
who wants the teddy bear with one leg? i do.:::['5-22-261']
not even close. okay, well, help me. i can't do this.:::['5-22-263']
all right, come on. let's do it.:::['5-22-264']
all right. sit down.:::['5-22-265']
all right, put your head back. all right. yes. okay.:::['5-22-266']
now, open your eyes. okay, they are.:::['5-22-267']
how many fingers am i holding up? four.:::['5-22-268']
oh, my god, i was thinking four.:::['5-22-269']
all right, why don't we start with a practice one, okay?:::['5-22-271']
no drops. great.:::['5-22-272']
on three. one, two, three.:::['5-22-273']
my pillow's all wet.:::['5-22-274']
well, you said it was practice.:::['5-22-275']
then why did you move? because i knew you were lying.:::['5-22-276']
all right. come here. come on. what are you doing? monica.:::['5-22-277']
stop it! oh, my god, stop it.:::['5-22-278']
i am going...:::['5-22-279']
turn it over. aah!:::['5-22-280']
i am going to get...:::['5-22-281']
get these drops in your eye.:::['5-22-282']
oh, my god. you really are freakishly strong.:::['5-22-283']
aah! aah! monica, stop it!:::['5-22-284']
damn, it's empty.:::['5-22-285']
wow. if joey and chandler walked in right now, we could make a fortune.:::['5-22-286']
ooh, that is definitely chandler, joey or ross.:::['5-22-287']
or rachel.:::['5-22-288']
hello? it's joey.:::['5-22-289']
i'm so glad you called. chandler told me what happened. he's really upset.:::['5-22-290']
not as upset as he's gonna be when he finds out what i did with his sweater vests.:::['5-22-291']
what did you do to his sweater vests?:::['5-22-292']
let's just say there's a well-dressed pack of dogs in ohio.:::['5-22-293']
monica, listen, is phoebe there? i gotta ask her something about the car.:::['5-22-294']
monica: yeah, hold on one second.:::['5-22-295']
hey, dude. joey: hey, pheebs.:::['5-22-296']
listen, this wooden box keeps sliding out from under the seat.:::['5-22-297']
what is it? oh, that's my grandma.:::['5-22-298']
and thanks, joey. she's having a really great time.:::['5-22-299']
is that joey? is that joey? let me talk to him.:::['5-22-300']
joey, chandler's here. he was wondering if...:::['5-22-301']
okay, i guess he ran out of change.:::['5-22-302']
he won't even talk to me.:::['5-22-303']
how am i gonna apologize to him if he won't even talk to me?:::['5-22-304']
maybe you should send him something.:::['5-22-305']
so when he gets to las vegas, he'll know that you're sorry.:::['5-22-306']
that's a good idea. i wonder where i could get a basket of porn?:::['5-22-307']
oh, no, don't say i'm sorry with porn.:::['5-22-308']
you know what you should send him? a carton of cigarettes.:::['5-22-309']
because that way he can trade it for protection.:::['5-22-310']
no. that's prison.:::['5-22-311']
i know how we're gonna figure this out.:::['5-22-313']
okay. clear your mind......and answer the first thing:::['5-22-314']
that comes into your head. okay?:::['5-22-315']
what's better, flora or fauna? fauna.:::['5-22-317']
simon or garfunkel? garfunkel.:::['5-22-318']
why are you mad at me? you said i was boring. oh.:::['5-22-319']
when did i say you were boring?:::['5-22-320']
oh, my god, i remember now. we were playing chess.:::['5-22-321']
phoebe, you and i have never played chess.:::['5-22-322']
oh, come on. yes.:::['5-22-323']
remember that time on the frozen lake? we were playing. you said i was boring.:::['5-22-324']
and then you took off your energy mask and you were cameron diaz.:::['5-22-325']
okay, there's a chance this may have been a dream.:::['5-22-326']
hey. stanley. hey.:::['5-22-327']
your leading man is here. let's get to work.:::['5-22-328']
um, slight change of plans. we've shut down.:::['5-22-329']
it's a money thing. we don't have any.:::['5-22-331']
ha, ha. you're kidding, right? no.:::['5-22-332']
what? it's probably just temporary.:::['5-22-333']
we're hoping to get more money soon, so if you could just, uh, hang out.:::['5-22-334']
hang out? how long?:::['5-22-335']
i don't know. a week. maybe two. the money'll turn up.:::['5-22-336']
people always wanna invest in movies. hey, you're not rich, are you?:::['5-22-337']
no. worth a shot.:::['5-22-338']
well, joey, let me know where you're staying, okay?:::['5-22-339']
hey, pal. are you joey tribbiani? yeah.:::['5-22-340']

joey: aw, come on. it'll be years before i forget you.:::['5-22-347']
joey, what's it like on a movie set, huh?:::['5-22-348']
do you have a dressing room? do you have a chair with your name on it?:::['5-22-349']
joey: uh, yeah, yeah, i got all that going on.:::['5-22-350']
listen, uh, make sure you tell chandler he couldn't have been more wrong.:::['5-22-351']

your tax dollars?:::['5-20-67']
wow, that sandwich smells good.:::['5-20-69']
did i say you could smell it?:::['5-20-70']
i can't smell it?:::['5-20-71']
half the taste is in the smell. you're sucking up all the taste units.:::['5-20-72']
okay, i'll give them back.:::['5-20-73']
what is so great about that sandwich?:::['5-20-74']
okay. imagine the best sex you ever had. okay.:::['5-20-75']
are you thinking about monica? yeah.:::['5-20-76']
please don't be from a real dinosaur. please, please.:::['5-20-78']
please, please, please.:::['5-20-79']
"made in mexico." yes!:::['5-20-80']
who would buy this?:::['5-20-81']
rach, it's me. pick up.:::['5-20-82']
i need more margarita things.:::['5-20-84']
i need some salt, some margarita mix and tequila.:::['5-20-85']
so all we had was ice?:::['5-20-86']
see if he has ice.:::['5-20-87']
it's emily here.:::['5-20-90']
i know this is out of the blue, but i'm getting married tomorrow.:::['5-20-91']
well, maybe i am...:::['5-20-92']
i keep thinking about you.:::['5-20-93']
and i'm wondering if we made a mistake giving up so fast.:::['5-20-94']
are you thinking about me?:::['5-20-95']
no, of course you're not. but if you are, call me tonight.:::['5-20-96']
where we going?:::['5-20-98']
this witness won't return my calls. we'll surprise him coming home.:::['5-20-99']
surprise him? we're not gonna make anybody mad, are we?:::['5-20-100']
come on, man.:::['5-20-101']
you gonna squeeze the perp's shoes a bit before he lawyers up?:::['5-20-102']
he's a witness, not a perp. and no one talks like that.:::['5-20-103']
yeah. no one talks like that.:::['5-20-104']
oh, what, like you're mr. cop? i'm more cop than you two.:::['5-20-105']
how do you figure that?:::['5-20-106']
i'm in the front seat, okay?:::['5-20-107']
i'm gary's partner.:::['5-20-108']
when you say "partner," it doesn't sound cop.:::['5-20-109']
it sounds gay.:::['5-20-110']
um, jealous.:::['5-20-111']
hey, we're undercover here. oh, yeah. no problem.:::['5-20-112']
ross. sorry.:::['5-20-113']
hey, gary. who am i?:::['5-20-115']
phone home.:::['5-20-116']
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors.:::['5-20-117']
what's up with that, serpico?:::['5-20-118']
emily: are you thinking about me? no, of course you're not.:::['5-20-119']
but if you are, call me tonight.:::['5-20-120']
thank god you were here. we have to erase that.:::['5-20-124']
what? we can't do that.:::['5-20-125']
we have to. what if ross hears that......and calls her:::['5-20-126']
and they get back together?:::['5-20-127']
is that what you want? ross back with that controlling......neurotic, crazy emily:::['5-20-128']
who wouldn't let him see you?:::['5-20-129']
no. oh, no, no.:::['5-20-130']
god, no. he should not get back with her.:::['5-20-131']
i know that, you know that. even ross knows that.:::['5-20-132']
but we have no right to erase his message.:::['5-20-133']
look, i'm his sister and i love him. i don't want to see him get hurt.:::['5-20-134']
doesn't that give me the right to control...:::['5-20-135']
help him?:::['5-20-136']
he's not the one who needs help.:::['5-20-137']
she's obviously unstable.:::['5-20-138']
she's thinking about running out on her wedding day.:::['5-20-139']
okay, fine. but look at the position she's putting him in.:::['5-20-140']
and what's he gonna do?:::['5-20-141']
break up their marriage on their wedding day?:::['5-20-142']
who would do that?:::['5-20-143']
okay, fine. all right. but that was different.:::['5-20-144']
although it did involve a lot of the same people.:::['5-20-145']
this is some twisted joke she's playing on him.:::['5-20-146']
you are crazy. she sounded genuinely upset.:::['5-20-147']
i mean, listen.:::['5-20-148']
your messages have been erased.:::['5-20-149']
okay, but we're safe, right? nothing bad's gonna go down.:::['5-20-151']
no. but that reminds me. sign this.:::['5-20-152']
ross: what is it?:::['5-20-153']
it says you can't sue if you scrape your knee......or get your head blown off.:::['5-20-154']
oh, hurry up. i want to sign that.:::['5-20-155']
gary: what is he doing? what the hell is he doing?:::['5-20-157']
is everything okay? what?:::['5-20-159']
he sees us. don't move. and don't look at him.:::['5-20-160']
hey, it's okay. it was just a car backfire.:::['5-20-161']
hey, look at that. you tried to save your buddy.:::['5-20-162']
gary: you see that?:::['5-20-163']
you see what he did?:::['5-20-164']
thanks, joey.:::['5-20-167']
uh... hello?:::['5-20-168']
we should go.:::['5-20-170']
no, wait.:::['5-20-171']
no. monica.:::['5-20-173']
monica, we have to fix this.:::['5-20-174']
what can we do? you erased the message.:::['5-20-175']
unless we tell him.:::['5-20-176']
if you want to be rational, i can't argue with you.:::['5-20-177']
fine, tell him. i just don't want to be a part of it.:::['5-20-179']
maybe that's emily leaving the exact same message.:::['5-20-180']
hey, ross, it's you.:::['5-20-181']
i just want you to remember this feeling.:::['5-20-182']
you are lucky to be alive.:::['5-20-183']
so live every day to the fullest.:::['5-20-184']
love yourself, okay?:::['5-20-185']
and also get stamps. bye.:::['5-20-186']
play that message for emily, and this problem goes away.:::['5-20-187']
anybody want to meet a hero?:::['5-20-189']
john glenn is here?:::['5-20-190']
gary: no. joey.:::['5-20-191']
we had the most incredible night.:::['5-20-192']
we're in the car... wait. hold on.:::['5-20-193']
okay, go ahead.:::['5-20-195', '3-4-134']
so we're in the car, and bang. a shot was fired.:::['5-20-196']
and joey, with no regard for his own safety......throws himself on me.:::['5-20-197']
it was a car backfire.:::['5-20-199']
but he didn't know that.:::['5-20-200']
yeah, i didn't know that.:::['5-20-201']
it could just as easily have been a bullet.:::['5-20-202']
ever think about joining the force? we could use a guy like you.:::['5-20-203']
who jumps at loud noises.:::['5-20-204']
wow. i could have died tonight.:::['5-20-205']
if the car that backfired had run over you.:::['5-20-206']
i'm going before he starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.:::['5-20-207']
i do have a newfound respect for life.:::['5-20-208']
you want to get some dinner? yeah, sure.:::['5-20-210']
you know what? if i heard a shot right now, i'd throw my body on you.:::['5-20-211']
maybe we should walk in a bad neighborhood.:::['5-20-212']
phoebe: bye. bye.:::['5-20-214']
i'd hate to save your life and kick your ass on the same day.:::['5-20-216']
joey: dude.:::['5-20-217']
why'd you take off?:::['5-20-218']
just going for a walk.:::['5-20-219']
around the living room, whatever.:::['5-20-220']
is something wrong? no. no, i'm just tired.:::['5-20-221']
you know, from the walk.:::['5-20-222']
you dove in front of ross.:::['5-20-224']
that's what this is about.:::['5-20-226']
oh, my god. you hate ross.:::['5-20-227']
i don't hate ross.:::['5-20-228']
of course you do. i saved him. you're mad at me. it adds up.:::['5-20-229']
you want ross out of the picture.:::['5-20-230']
i don't know. but i don't like what i'm hearing.:::['5-20-232']
i'm glad you saved ross. but it could've been a bullet.:::['5-20-233']
and you didn't try to save me.:::['5-20-234']
you're upset because you think i chose ross over you.:::['5-20-236']
no, i knew you could take care of yourself.:::['5-20-237']
you know? i mean, ross needs help. he's not "street" like us.:::['5-20-238']
you'd risk your life for ross before you would for me.:::['5-20-239']
that's the bottom line.:::['5-20-240']
no, not exactly.:::['5-20-241']
all right, look.:::['5-20-242', '4-8-239', '4-19-143']
i wasn't trying to save ross.:::['5-20-243']
my sandwich was next to ross.:::['5-20-245']
i was trying to save my sandwich.:::['5-20-247']
from a bullet?:::['5-20-248']
i know it doesn't make much sense. "much" sense?:::['5-20-249']
chandler, it was instinct. i just went for it.:::['5-20-250']
you risked your life for a sandwich?:::['5-20-251']
i know it sounds crazy......but this is the greatest:::['5-20-252']
sandwich in the world.:::['5-20-253']
so you didn't choose ross before me?:::['5-20-254']
no. i would never do that.:::['5-20-255']
you're like my brother.:::['5-20-256']
in fact, to prove how much you mean to me...:::['5-20-258']
thanks. easy, it's not a hot dog.:::['5-20-260']
how good is that?:::['5-20-261']
you're showing me how much i mean to you.:::['5-20-265']
with a bite.:::['5-20-266']
you are in our apartment all the time.:::['5-20-271']
this is just a drop in the bucket, mister.:::['5-20-272']
it doesn't matter. the important thing is that you're here.:::['5-20-273']
you're my friend and you're here.:::['5-20-274']
okay, just a little scared. what's going on?:::['5-20-275']
the most amazing thing happened tonight.:::['5-20-276']
i thought my number was up.:::['5-20-277']
i had an actual near-death experience.:::['5-20-278']
we were on the ride-along with gary and somebody took a shot at me.:::['5-20-280']
no. a car backfired.:::['5-20-282']
but i thought somebody was taking a shot at me. and, rach......i survived.:::['5-20-283']
and i was filled with this great respect for life.:::['5-20-284']
i want to experience every moment.:::['5-20-285']
i want to seize every opportunity.:::['5-20-286']
i am seeing everything so clearly now.:::['5-20-287']
because a car backfired?:::['5-20-288']
okay. why are you here?:::['5-20-289']
i don't know how this fits into your whole seizing thing......but emily called you today.:::['5-20-290']
you talked to her? she left a message.:::['5-20-291']
but it kind of got erased.:::['5-20-292']
i mean, there's something wrong with your machine.:::['5-20-293']
what did she say?:::['5-20-294']
something about having second thoughts about the wedding.:::['5-20-295']
and did you guys make a mistake breaking up?:::['5-20-296']
and she wants you to call her.:::['5-20-297']
that was a good thing that i told you, right?:::['5-20-299']
yeah. yes. of course.:::['5-20-300']
okay, thank you. thank you. because...:::['5-20-301']
i'm gonna tell monica i was right.:::['5-20-302']
because she didn't want...:::['5-20-303']
not important. point is, i was right. your decision.:::['5-20-304']
i was right.:::['5-20-306']
your decision.:::['5-20-307']
i guess i should call emily.:::['5-20-309']
no, that's not the right decision.:::['5-20-310']
i mean......that woman made you miserable.:::['5-20-313']
okay, ross?:::['5-20-314']
do you really want to get back into that?:::['5-20-315']
okay, look. yesterday......i wouldn't have even:::['5-20-316']
considered calling her back.:::['5-20-317']
but my ex-wife calls on the same day......i have a near-death experience?:::['5-20-318']
that's gotta mean something.:::['5-20-319']
that was not a near-death experience. that was barely an experience.:::['5-20-320']
you weren't there.:::['5-20-321']
maybe this is something that i'm supposed to seize, you know?:::['5-20-322']
okay. you know what?:::['5-20-323']
maybe this is not about seizing stuff.:::['5-20-324']
maybe this is about escaping stuff.:::['5-20-325']
okay? look at today.:::['5-20-326']
i mean, you escaped......death.:::['5-20-327']
and maybe this is a chance for you to escape......getting back together with emily.:::['5-20-328']
that does make sense.:::['5-20-329']
because i do want to seize some opportunity......but i really don't want:::['5-20-330']
to see or talk to her.:::['5-20-331']
yeah, maybe today's just......close-call day.:::['5-20-333']
hey, thanks, rach.:::['5-20-334']
oh, honey. no problem.:::['5-20-335']
wait, wait. the message is blinking.:::['5-20-336']
maybe you didn't erase it.:::['5-20-337']
hey, ross, it's you...:::['5-20-338']
that's an old message. nobody needs to hear that.:::['5-20-339']
hey, um, was monica here?:::['5-20-340']
i want my money back.:::['5-20-342']
you probably need that for stamps, right?:::['5-20-343']
ross: hey, pheebs?:::['5-20-344']
has gary ever been shot at for real?:::['5-20-345']
yes, once.:::['5-20-346']
he kind of did it to himself.:::['5-20-348']
it's not really a good story.:::['5-20-349']
i wonder how i'd react under fire. and not backfire......but heavy fire.:::['5-20-350']
like if i was in a war.:::['5-20-351']
man, i would be great in a war.:::['5-20-352']
i think i'd make a fantastic military leader.:::['5-20-353']
i mean, i know i'd make general before any of you guys.:::['5-20-354']
before or after you were shot by your own troops?:::['5-20-355']
i know joey would be in the foxhole protecting all of us.:::['5-20-356']
if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.:::['5-20-357']
yeah, hero sandwiches.:::['5-20-358']
you all know i'm a pacifist, so i'm not interested in war in any way.:::['5-20-359']
but when the revolution comes, i'll have to destroy you all.:::['5-20-360']
not you, joey.:::['5-20-361']
i'm gonna get more coffee, do you want anything, baby doll?:::['5-21-0']
i'm fine. thanks.:::['5-21-1']
see, i can't pull off "baby doll," can i?:::['5-21-2']
no, i think we learned that from the "sugar lips" incident.:::['5-21-3']
i'm gonna get some tea. okay.:::['5-21-4']
how you doing, pumpkin?:::['5-21-5']
so it looks like it's going well for you two. i know. really well.:::['5-21-7']
in fact, i'm gonna ask phoebe to move in with me.:::['5-21-8']
oh, my god. what do you think?:::['5-21-9']
i think that it's great. when are you gonna ask her?:::['5-21-10']
tonight. but don't say anything, okay? i swear. i promise. i promise.:::['5-21-11']
my god, i'm so excited.:::['5-21-12']
but listen, do not get her flowers, okay?:::['5-21-13']
because she cries when they die, then there's the whole funeral.:::['5-21-14']
i'll see you after work, sweetie. okay. bye.:::['5-21-15']
so, what movie should we see?:::['5-21-16']
gary's gonna ask you to move in with him.:::['5-21-17']
what? really?:::['5-21-18']
he told me at the counter. he made me promise not to tell......but i couldn't hold it in any longer.:::['5-21-19']
right? because it's fast. because it's so fast. it's fast.:::['5-21-21']
relax. it's phoebe, not you. oh.:::['5-21-22']
good for you, pheebs. way to go.:::['5-21-23']
no, but it is fast, isn't it? no.:::['5-21-24']
i like him a lot but i don't think i'm ready. so, what are you gonna do?:::['5-21-25']
i don't know. i'll just handle it. i'll ask you to talk to him.:::['5-21-26']
me? why me?:::['5-21-27']
because you are so afraid of commitment.:::['5-21-28']
you talk to him. make him scared like you, make him a man.:::['5-21-29']
i'll try, but i'm not sure what good it would do......because i'm less afraid of commitment:::['5-21-30']
than i used to be.:::['5-21-31']
still terrified. i'll take care of it no problem.:::['5-21-33']
hey, ross, is, uh, staten island really an island?:::['5-21-34']
uh-huh. that's why they call it staten "island.":::['5-21-35']
oh, i thought it was like long island.:::['5-21-36']
also an island.:::['5-21-37']
hey, what time is it? two seventeen.:::['5-21-38']
yeah, i realized it a half-hour ago, but i didn't wanna say anything......because i didn't wanna jinx it.:::['5-21-41']
wow, we are pretty good at this.:::['5-21-42']
i think that's the first time i've ever missed a meal.:::['5-21-44']
i think my pants are a little loose.:::['5-21-45']
hey, you guys. uh, is monica here?:::['5-21-46']
joey: no. ross: no.:::['5-21-47']
listen, um, i bought something. i'm not sure she's gonna like it.:::['5-21-48']
and it's gonna seem crazy......but this is something i've wanted:::['5-21-49']
since i was a little girl.:::['5-21-50']
you bought shaun cassidy.:::['5-21-51']
no. i wish.:::['5-21-52']
okay, you ready?:::['5-21-53']
both: yeah.:::['5-21-54']
oh, my god. what is it? what the hell is that?:::['5-21-56']
it's a cat. that is not a cat.:::['5-21-57']
yes, it is.:::['5-21-58', '5-7-198', '5-17-289']
why is it inside out?:::['5-21-59']
excuse me, but this is a purebred, show-quality sphinx cat.:::['5-21-60']
how much did you pay for that?:::['5-21-61']
well, it was a little extravagant, but i got a good deal.:::['5-21-62']
ross: yeah, how much? thousand bucks.:::['5-21-63']
on a cat?:::['5-21-64']
it's not a cat.:::['5-21-65', '5-21-71']
all right. listen, ball boys.:::['5-21-66']
my grandmother had one of these when i was little......and it was the sweetest thing.:::['5-21-67']
i mean, it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and just purr all day long......and i would drag a shoe string:::['5-21-68']
on the ground and it would chase it.:::['5-21-69']
free cats do that too, you know.:::['5-21-70']
look, guys, i'm really excited about this, okay?:::['5-21-72']
i don't care what you think.:::['5-21-73']
i'm gonna go set up a little litter box for mrs. whiskerson.:::['5-21-74']
well, what am i gonna call her? fluffy?:::['5-21-75']
hey, do you wanna get something to eat or, uh......see how long we can throw this ball:::['5-21-76']
back and forth?:::['5-21-77']
uh, the ball thing. yeah?:::['5-21-78']
hey, ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go for like two straight hours......without dropping it?:::['5-21-79']
uh, yeah, it would.:::['5-21-80']
let's do it. okay.:::['5-21-81']
uh-oh. ross: what?:::['5-21-82']
i have to pee.:::['5-21-83']
and rachel's in the bathroom.:::['5-21-84']
joey: man, i didn't think we were gonna make it.:::['5-21-85']
don't switch hands, okay?:::['5-21-87']
hey, ladies. what are you in here for?:::['5-21-88']
hey, chandler, what are you doing here?:::['5-21-89']
gary, i am here to report a crime. yeah?:::['5-21-90']
it is a crime that you and i don't spend time together.:::['5-21-91']
ha, ha. what's up?:::['5-21-92']
uh, well, i heard that you were thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you......and i thought maybe we should have:::['5-21-93']
a talk, you know, man to... well, me.:::['5-21-94']
sure, okay.:::['5-21-95']
um, are you crazy?:::['5-21-96']
if you live with phoebe, you two are gonna be, you know, living together.:::['5-21-98']
yeah, i considered that. i just know it'd make me happy.:::['5-21-99']
heh. you mean scared. no, i mean happy.:::['5-21-100']
scared happy.:::['5-21-101']
chandler, what are you doing? i'm trying to open your eyes, my man.:::['5-21-102']
don't you see? if you live with phoebe, she is always gonna be there.:::['5-21-103']
you're gonna get home, she's there. you go to bed, she's there.:::['5-21-104']
you wake up and oh, yes, she's there.:::['5-21-105']
i know. i can't wait.:::['5-21-106']
were your parents happy or something?:::['5-21-107']
listen, chandler, the way i see it......i was lucky enough to find someone:::['5-21-108']
that i really love.:::['5-21-109']
i just wanna be around her as much as i can.:::['5-21-110']
wow, you know, when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.:::['5-21-111']
so you know what i'm talking about? yeah, i think i do.:::['5-21-112']
you move in with her. you move in right with her right now.:::['5-21-114']
maybe i should move in with monica. no, it's too soon for you guys.:::['5-21-115']
you're right about that.:::['5-21-116']
when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon......they discovered what appeared:::['5-21-117']
to be the remains......of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws.:::['5-21-118']
how did it get there?:::['5-21-119']
maybe this should be more of a quiet game.:::['5-21-120']
joey, i left my watch on the counter last night.:::['5-21-122']
it was here. where is it? i don't know.:::['5-21-123']
well, come on, i'm late for work.:::['5-21-124']
how do you know? you don't have a watch.:::['5-21-125']
guys, could you stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it?:::['5-21-126']
oh, i don't know. yeah, can't do it.:::['5-21-127']
what? whatever you do, do not drop that ball.:::['5-21-128']
yeah, we haven't dropped it in... two hours, 27 minutes.:::['5-21-129']
i'm not gonna be able to make it in to work today.:::['5-21-131']
um, i don't feel very good.:::['5-21-132']
wow, uh, for a second there, i thought i was feeling better, but i'm not.:::['5-21-134']
ross: hey, rach. hey.:::['5-21-135']
check it out. almost three hours without dropping it.:::['5-21-136']
wow, congratulations. that's quite a waste of time.:::['5-21-137']
monica: rach. rachel: yeah.:::['5-21-138']
you have scratches all over you. what happened?:::['5-21-139']
well, it's my cat. what?:::['5-21-140']
oh, yeah, i got a cat. i don't want a cat.:::['5-21-141']
oh, don't worry, it's not a cat. ross: yeah.:::['5-21-142']
you guys, this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat.:::['5-21-143']
it's not sweet. it's not cute.:::['5-21-144']
i even dragged a string on the ground......and it just flipped out:::['5-21-145']
and scratched the hell out of me.:::['5-21-146']
and i swear... i know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me......i know it's saying, "rachel.":::['5-21-147']
doesn't sound as crazy as paying $1000 for a cat.:::['5-21-148']
you paid $1000 for a cat when you owe me 300?:::['5-21-149']
well, i was gonna let you play with it.:::['5-21-150']
did you talk to gary about the moving in thing?:::['5-21-152']
yes, i did, and i think you should do it. what?:::['5-21-153']
he's a great guy and he loves you a lot. you are a very lucky lady.:::['5-21-154']
you are useless.:::['5-21-155']
freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do......and you can't even do that right. god.:::['5-21-156']
sorry. if he asked me, i'd move in with him.:::['5-21-157']
ooh, ooh, get out of here, good-for-nothing.:::['5-21-159']
hey, chandler. hey, gar.:::['5-21-160']
can i talk to you for a second? yeah. okay.:::['5-21-162']
you look very pretty today. thanks. okay.:::['5-21-163']
here's the thing. yeah.:::['5-21-164']
you know, i really want this relationship to move forward.:::['5-21-165']
because if you're not moving forward, you know, you're just moving backwards.:::['5-21-166']
now, that's not true. if you're not moving forward, you're staying still.:::['5-21-167']
and staying still is good. watch this.:::['5-21-168']
i want you to move in with me.:::['5-21-170']
but don't you think that it's a little it's too soon?:::['5-21-172']
i mean, there's so much we don't know about each other.:::['5-21-173']
oh, okay. i get it.:::['5-21-175']
i don't want us to jump into something that we're not ready for, you know.:::['5-21-176']
i really don't want to mess up what we have.:::['5-21-178']
i'm just worried it's gonna be a big mistake.:::['5-21-179']
which is why my answer is yes.:::['5-21-181']
you're so happy.:::['5-21-183']
monica, stop throwing it so hard.:::['5-21-184']
we're on the same team.:::['5-21-185']
four hours? you guys have been doing this for four hours?:::['5-21-186']
that's right, baby.:::['5-21-187']
all right. let me in. no, no. don't do it.:::['5-21-188']
he's a dropper.:::['5-21-190']
oh, yeah. that's right.:::['5-21-191']
i'm not a dropper.:::['5-21-192']
it's really a three-person game, you know?:::['5-21-193']
it's throwing and catching.:::['5-21-194']
oh, oh, it's so hard.:::['5-21-196']
don't worry, guys. it's not a cat.:::['5-21-197']
oh, my... oh, good god.:::['5-21-198']
i give up, you guys. i don't know what i'm gonna do with this thing.:::['5-21-199']
baking it didn't help, huh?:::['5-21-200']
why don't you just take it back to where you got it?:::['5-21-201']
i tried. they won't take her back.:::['5-21-202']
maybe that's because she's a minion of the antichrist.:::['5-21-203']
rach, why won't they take it back?:::['5-21-204']
well, they said they would, but would only give me store credit.:::['5-21-205']
what am i gonna do, get a thousand regular cats?:::['5-21-206']
if you want, you can keep it until you find out what to do with it.:::['5-21-207']
no, mon, that's not the point. i'm out a thousand dollars......i'm all scratched up......and i'm stuck with this stupid cat:::['5-21-208']
that looks like a hand.:::['5-21-209']
the cat's made my eyes water. don't throw it to me.:::['5-21-211']
my vision's been compromised.:::['5-21-212']
oh, god. okay. okay.:::['5-21-213']
it's okay. man, that was close.:::['5-21-214']
yeah, you almost overreacted to something.:::['5-21-215']
we have great news. we're moving in together. isn't it great?:::['5-21-217']
joey: congratulations. ross: that's great.:::['5-21-219']
i know, i'm so excited. so am i.:::['5-21-220']
well, you're not more excited than i am. no way. i'm the most excited. ha.:::['5-21-221']
okay, i'll see you at the station later.:::['5-21-222']
okay, yeah, i'll see you later. don't forget about the moving-in.:::['5-21-223']
so you're moving in with him? what happened?:::['5-21-224']
i couldn't tell him no. he got so sad. but maybe it'll be all right.:::['5-21-225']
i do really like him a lot......and probably do it eventually anyway.:::['5-21-226']
and plus, think of all the money i'll save on stamps.:::['5-21-227']
why, do you write him a lot?:::['5-21-228']
no, i just heard when people live together......they split the cost:::['5-21-229']
of stamps, don't they?:::['5-21-230']
yeah, yeah. chandler: that's right.:::['5-21-231']
i'm sorry, the oven mitts really freaked me out.:::['5-21-233']
gary: hey, honey.:::['5-21-234']
did you find any apartments in brooklyn heights?:::['5-21-235']
oh, really? yeah.:::['5-21-237']
nothing at all? no.:::['5-21-238']
as soon as something opens up, we'll move in.:::['5-21-239']
unless it doesn't have a pool. i need a pool.:::['5-21-240']
phoebe, can i talk to you for a second? uh-huh.:::['5-21-241']
take a seat.:::['5-21-242']
you okay? you feel all right?:::['5-21-243']
yeah, i feel great because we're moving in together.:::['5-21-244']
so you, uh...:::['5-21-245']
you checked the paper for listings in brooklyn heights, right?:::['5-21-246']
you checked the post?:::['5-21-247']
yeah, uh-huh, there was nothing.:::['5-21-248']
can i get some water? in a minute.:::['5-21-249']
you checked today's post? um, yeah, today's.:::['5-21-250']
hmm. because, uh, this is today's post.:::['5-21-251']
and, uh, these are the listings i found.:::['5-21-252']
brooklyn heights, two bedrooms. brooklyn heights, one bedroom.:::['5-21-253']
brooklyn heights, brooklyn heights, brooklyn heights.:::['5-21-254']
oh, are these for rent? i thought people were just bragging.:::['5-21-255']
let me tell you what i think might be going on here.:::['5-21-256']
no, no, don't look at the table. look at me.:::['5-21-257']
okay, i think somebody asked someone to move in with him.:::['5-21-258']
and i think someone said yes, but now she's having doubts......because things are moving too fast:::['5-21-259']
for someone.:::['5-21-260']
does that sound at all possible to you?:::['5-21-261']
yes, yes. yes, fine, i am someone.:::['5-21-262']
you want me to say it? i have doubts.:::['5-21-263']
phoebe, it's okay that you feel this way.:::['5-21-266']
i mean, it is soon, and there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.:::['5-21-267']
i just figured everything i know about you, i really like.:::['5-21-268']
the things i don't know, i get to learn in a place with both our names on the mailbox.:::['5-21-269']
that's so sweet.:::['5-21-270', '5-17-308', '4-2-176']
sweetheart, but none of that matters if it's too soon for you.:::['5-21-271']
it's fine. we don't have to move in together. i just want you to be happy.:::['5-21-272']
living with you would make me happy. phoebe, you don't have to say that.:::['5-21-273']
no, i really wanna live with you. i wanna move in with you.:::['5-21-274']
are you sure? yes.:::['5-21-275']
definitely, yes. let's live in an apartment that we both live in.:::['5-21-276']
oh, that's great. oh, wait, one sec. one sec.:::['5-21-277']
hey, you. behind the glass. who are you looking at?:::['5-21-278']
i've always wanted to say that every time i was in one of these rooms......which was never.:::['5-21-279']
show cat. quality show cat.:::['5-21-280']
show cat. oh, my god.:::['5-21-281']
what's wrong with your baby?:::['5-21-282']
that's not a baby. that's a cat.:::['5-21-283']
ew, it's creepy looking. oh, no.:::['5-21-284']
no, it's actually very sweet. it's very sweet. look.:::['5-21-285']
yeah. do you want it? ha, ha. no, i hate cats.:::['5-21-286']
well, so then what are you doing to me? okay?:::['5-21-287']
just get out of here, all right? move on.:::['5-21-288']
jeez. wow, what an unusual cat.:::['5-21-289']
yes, thank you. exactly. you want it?:::['5-21-290']
i was thinking about getting a cat. i was just gonna go to the shelter, but...:::['5-21-292']
okay. why not? oh, terrific. that'll be $2,000.:::['5-21-293']
ha. what? okay, a thousand.:::['5-21-294']
i thought you wanted me to adopt your cat?:::['5-21-295']
well, i do, but you're gonna have to look at this as more of an investment than a cat.:::['5-21-296']
okay, yeah. i just wanted a cat.:::['5-21-297']
obviously, you know how to haggle......so i'm not gonna try and:::['5-21-299']
take you on, okay?:::['5-21-300']
so $800, and i don't call the cops......which i should:::['5-21-301']
because you are robbing me blind.:::['5-21-302']
blind. just take the cat, leave the money and run away.:::['5-21-303']
just run away. damn it. ugh.:::['5-21-304']
can't you at least smile or something?:::['5-21-305']
okay, did anybody just hear that? anybody?:::['5-21-306']
i'm starving. monica: come on, guys. suck it up.:::['5-21-307']
we're closing in on 10 hours.:::['5-21-308']
it's gut-check time.:::['5-21-309']
i don't know who made you the boss. we invented this game.:::['5-21-310']
please. i made this game what it is.:::['5-21-311']
not fun anymore?:::['5-21-312']
i'm still hungry.:::['5-21-313']
all right, there's some pizza at my place.:::['5-21-314']
we can eat with one hand, right? are you with me?:::['5-21-315']
i am. all right, let's go. come on.:::['5-21-316']
let's go, team monica.:::['5-21-317']
all right, we can work out the name later.:::['5-21-318']
rachel, what is your cat doing in one of my bowls?:::['5-21-319']
it's not. i'm defrosting a chicken.:::['5-21-320']
oh, i sold, uh, mrs. whiskerson.:::['5-21-321']
did you get your money back? yeah, $1500.:::['5-21-323']
monica: wow, you made a profit?:::['5-21-324']
i just came for the red velvet pillow. rachel: oh, yeah.:::['5-21-325']
there you go. thanks, rachel.:::['5-21-326']
and, uh, don't forget, you can come visit her any time you want.:::['5-21-327']
oh, good. great. i'll keep that in mind.:::['5-21-328']
ahem, hey. so, what is this, some kind of snake or something?:::['5-21-329']
i really like waking up with you.:::['5-21-330']
i like waking up with you too.:::['5-21-331']
oh, it's such a beautiful morning.:::['5-21-332']
i could stay here all day.:::['5-21-333']
we could have breakfast in bed. wait, just a second.:::['5-21-335']
all right. come on, monica. look alive. come on, look alive.:::['5-21-338']
oh, good. you're all up.:::['5-21-339']
phoebe, it's six o'clock in the morning. why aren't you at gary's?:::['5-21-340']
oh, yeah. that's over. all: what?:::['5-21-341']
come on, gary's such a great guy. whatever the problem, you can work it out.:::['5-21-342']
he shot a bird. oh, that is over.:::['5-21-343']
monica: i'm sorry. ross: that's terrible.:::['5-21-344']
are you okay? yeah, yeah, i'll be all right.:::['5-21-345']
oh, hey, here, pheebs. oh. nah, i don't feel like playing.:::['5-21-346']
just pretend that it didn't happen, okay? no one needs to know.:::['5-21-348']
phoebe's not an official ball player.:::['5-21-349']
i mean, only official ball players can drop the ball.:::['5-21-350']
joey: come on. ross: let's go.:::['5-21-351']
phoebe, honey, you wanna get breakfast?:::['5-21-352']
phoebe: yeah. okay. okay, let's race.:::['5-21-353']
first one there wins. ha, ha.:::['5-21-354']
you guys wanna eat here? all: yeah.:::['5-21-355']
oh, man, that was great, huh?:::['5-21-356']
can you believe how long we threw that ball around?:::['5-21-357']
it is amazing it lasted that long.:::['5-21-358']
i know. my arm is killing me.:::['5-21-359']
no, i meant with the dropper over here.:::['5-21-360']
you know, how did i get this reputation as a dropper?:::['5-21-361']
i am anything but a dropper.:::['5-21-362']
monica, that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever.:::['5-8-0']
it was so good. i think you killed us.:::['5-8-1']
i couldn't possibly eat another bite.:::['5-8-2']
i need something sweet.:::['5-8-3']
does anyone wanna watch tv?:::['5-8-4']
group: yeah. sure.:::['5-8-5']
monica, your remote doesn't work.:::['5-8-6']
phoebe, you have to lift it and point.:::['5-8-7']
hey, you know what we should all do?:::['5-8-10']
we should play that game where everyone says one thing they're thankful for.:::['5-8-11']
oh, i... i am thankful for this beautiful fall we've been having.:::['5-8-12']
very nice. sweet, joe.:::['5-8-13']
yeah, the other day, i was at the bus stop......and this lovely fall breeze:::['5-8-14']
came in out of nowhere......and blew this chick's skirt right up.:::['5-8-15']
oh, which reminds me, i'm also thankful for thongs.:::['5-8-16']
it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering.:::['5-8-17']
it's amazing how much they can do with so little material.:::['5-8-18']
and the way they play with your mind. i mean, is it there? is it not there?:::['5-8-19']
are you aware that you're still talking?:::['5-8-20']
is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong?:::['5-8-21']
huh. i don't know what to pick.:::['5-8-22']
am i more thankful for my divorce, or my eviction? hmm.:::['5-8-23']
wow, see, and i didn't think you'd be able to come up with anything.:::['5-8-24']
i'm sorry. it's just this is the worst thanksgiving ever.:::['5-8-25']
no, no, no. i am the king of bad thanksgivings.:::['5-8-26']
you can't just swoop in here with your bad marriage......and take that away from me.:::['5-8-27']
you're not gonna tell the whole story......about how your parents:::['5-8-28']
got divorced, are you?:::['5-8-29']
group: no, no.:::['5-8-30']
come on. i want to hear it.:::['5-8-31']
it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out.:::['5-8-32']
it's a tradition, like the parade.:::['5-8-33']
if the parade decided it was gay, moved out and abandoned its entire family.:::['5-8-34']
now, chandler, dear.:::['5-8-35']
just because your father and i are getting a divorce......doesn't mean we don't love you.:::['5-8-36']
it just means......he would rather sleep:::['5-8-37']
with the houseboy than with me.:::['5-8-38']
more turkey, mr. chandler?:::['5-8-39']
you're right, yours is worse. you are the king of bad thanksgivings.:::['5-8-40']
i don't know about that. i've got one that's worse.:::['5-8-41']
really? worse than::::['5-8-42']
"more turkey, mr. chandler?":::['5-8-43']
did the little rich boy had a problem with the butler?:::['5-8-44']
yes, mine's worse.:::['5-8-45']
more bandages! more bandages!:::['5-8-46']
please, can i get some more bandages in here?:::['5-8-47']
this man is... aah!:::['5-8-48']
in this life, phoebe.:::['5-8-50']
oh, this life.:::['5-8-51']
oh, okay. no, chandler's is worse.:::['5-8-52']
man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that.:::['5-8-53']
i don't have any past life memories.:::['5-8-54']
of course, you don't, sweetie. you're brand-new.:::['5-8-55']
i know monica's worst thanksgiving.:::['5-8-56']
oh, let's not tell this story. oh, come on.:::['5-8-57']
oh, no! i know! i know!:::['5-8-58']
it's the one where joey got monica's turkey stuck on his head.:::['5-8-59']
joey got a turkey stuck on his head?:::['5-8-61']
hey, it's not like it sounds.:::['5-8-62']
it's exactly like it sounds.:::['5-8-63']
joey: hello?:::['5-8-64']
joey: phoebe? joey?:::['5-8-66']
joey: i know.:::['5-8-69']
it's stuck.:::['5-8-70']
phoebe: step. how did it get on?:::['5-8-71']
oh, my god. monica's going to totally freak out.:::['5-8-73']
joey: well, then help me get it off.:::['5-8-74']
of course it smells really bad. you have your head up a dead animal.:::['5-8-76']
hey, did you get the turkey...? oh, my god!:::['5-8-78']
what are you doing? is this supposed to be funny?:::['5-8-82']
no, it's not supposed to be funny. it's supposed to be scary.:::['5-8-83']
get that off now.:::['5-8-84']
joey: i can't. it's stuck.:::['5-8-85']
well, i don't care. that turkey has to feed 20 people.:::['5-8-86']
they're not going to eat it off your head.:::['5-8-87']
hold on, okay? let's just all think.:::['5-8-88']
okay, i got it. phoebe?:::['5-8-89']
all right. you pull.:::['5-8-90']
i'm gonna spread the legs as wide as i can.:::['5-8-91']
joey, now is not the time. joey: yeah. sorry. right, sorry.:::['5-8-92']
okay, count to three. one, two......three.:::['5-8-93']
joey: it worked. i scared you. i knew it. ha, ha!:::['5-8-94']
i'm over here, big guy. joey: yeah, you are. ha, ha!:::['5-8-95']
i scared you. whoo!:::['5-8-96']
you did look like an idiot.:::['5-8-97']
hey, i wasn't the only one who looked like an idiot, all right?:::['5-8-98']
remember when ross tried to say "butternut squash"......and it came out, "squatternut bosh"?:::['5-8-99']
yeah, that's the same.:::['5-8-100']
that's it. that's my worst thanksgiving.:::['5-8-101']
oh, wait. that can't be the one that rachel was talking about......because she didn't even know:::['5-8-102']
that that happened.:::['5-8-103']
so, what's yours? chandler: what was it?:::['5-8-104']
um, i really don't wanna tell this story.:::['5-8-105']
oh, come on, monica.:::['5-8-106']
reliving past pain and getting depressed is what thanksgiving's all about.:::['5-8-107']
you know, for me, anyway. and, of course, the indians.:::['5-8-108']
look, of all people, you do not want me to tell this story.:::['5-8-109']
what is that supposed to mean?:::['5-8-110']
monica, i think rachel's here.:::['5-8-111']
monica: i'll get it.:::['5-8-112']
happy thanksgiving. not for me.:::['5-8-113']
chip and i broke up.:::['5-8-114']
you know how my parents are out of town, and chip was gonna come over?:::['5-8-117']
yeah, yeah. and you were gonna give him, you know......your "flower.":::['5-8-118']
okay, monica, can you just call it sex?:::['5-8-119']
it really creeps me out when you call it that.:::['5-8-120']
okay, and by the way......while we're at it, a guy's thing:::['5-8-121']
is not called his "tenderness.":::['5-8-122']
believe me.:::['5-8-123']
hi. both: hi, rachel.:::['5-8-124']
rachel: happy thanksgiving. judy: you too, sweetheart.:::['5-8-125']
jack: oh. hi.:::['5-8-127']
uh, everyone......this is chandler.:::['5-8-128']
my roommate and lead singer of our band. heh.:::['5-8-129']
oh. this is monica.:::['5-8-131']
i'm so glad you could come, chandler.:::['5-8-134']
we've got plenty of food, so i hope you're hungry.:::['5-8-135']
oh, mom, no, no, chandler hates thanksgiving......and doesn't eat any thanksgiving food.:::['5-8-136']
oh. well, i'm so glad you brought him here, then.:::['5-8-137']
hey, chandler, um...:::['5-8-138']
if you want, i can make you some macaroni and cheese for dinner.:::['5-8-139']
as long as the pilgrims didn't eat it, then i'm in.:::['5-8-140']
so, uh, rach...:::['5-8-142']
does it...? does it feel weird around here now?:::['5-8-143']
you know, since i've been away at college?:::['5-8-144']
that's cool.:::['5-8-147', '5-1-194']
ugh! i cannot believe chip dumped me for that slut, nancy branson.:::['5-8-149']
i am never going out with him again.:::['5-8-150']
i don't care how much he begs.:::['5-8-151']
i think his begging days are over, now that he's with nancy branson.:::['5-8-152']
you know what? i've just had it with high-school boys.:::['5-8-153']
they're just silly.:::['5-8-154']
they're just silly, stupid boys.:::['5-8-155']
i'm gonna start dating men.:::['5-8-156']
uh, i'm sorry, judy.:::['5-8-157']
i couldn't find that bowl you and jack were looking for.:::['5-8-158']
call them mom and dad, you loser.:::['5-8-159']
hey, chandler?:::['5-8-161']
did you like the macaroni and cheese?:::['5-8-162']
oh, yeah. it was great. you should be a chef.:::['5-8-163']
all this stuff about nancy branson being a slut was all a rumor.:::['5-8-166']
chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house tonight.:::['5-8-167']
oh, that is so great. rachel: i know.:::['5-8-168']
oh, gosh. listen, if you and chip do it tonight......um, promise me:::['5-8-169']
you'll tell me everything?:::['5-8-170']
oh, totally, totally. it's not that big a deal. we already kind of did it once, you know.:::['5-8-171']
i know, but this time you're gonna definitely know whether or not you did it.:::['5-8-172']
oh, and chip promised that this time it would last at least for an entire song.:::['5-8-174']
so i'm thinking of asking rachel out tonight.:::['5-8-175']
you know, maybe playing her that song we wrote last week.:::['5-8-176']
"emotional knapsack"? right on. right on.:::['5-8-177']
oh, uh, but don't take long, okay? because we're testing our fake id's tonight.:::['5-8-178']
right, clifford alvarez?:::['5-8-179']
listen, roland cheng......if things go well,i may be out with her all night.:::['5-8-180']
dude, don't do that to me.:::['5-8-181']
oh, no. it's cool, you can stay here. my parents won't mind.:::['5-8-182']
it's not that. i don't wanna be stuck here all night with your fat sister.:::['5-8-183']
monica, why don't you finish off these pies?:::['5-8-185']
i don't have any more room in the fridge.:::['5-8-186']
no, thank you.:::['5-8-188', '4-19-128', '3-4-258']
well, judy, you did it.:::['5-8-189']
she's finally full.:::['5-8-190']
i called you fat?:::['5-8-191']
i don't even remember that. well, i do.:::['5-8-192']
i'm so sorry. i really am. but, come on, i was an idiot back then.:::['5-8-193']
i rushed the stage at a wham! concert, for crying out loud.:::['5-8-194']
oh, i can't believe you called her fat.:::['5-8-195']
i can't believe you let george michael slap you.:::['5-8-196']
i am really sorry.:::['5-8-197']
that is so terrible. i'm so, so sorry.:::['5-8-198']
actually, that's not the thanksgiving i was talking about.:::['5-8-199']
yes, it was. no, it wasn't. it was actually...:::['5-8-200']
thanksgiving's over. get ready for christmas.:::['5-8-201']
who wants to get a christmas tree?:::['5-8-202']
oh, no. i have the cutest christmas story.:::['5-8-203']
we wanna hear monica's thanksgiving story.:::['5-8-204']
fine, all right. mine had a dwarf that got broke in half.:::['5-8-205']
but, you know, whatever.:::['5-8-206']
so, rachel, your mom tells me you changed your major again?:::['5-8-207']
oh, yeah, i had to.:::['5-8-208']
there was never any parking by the psychology building.:::['5-8-209']
hi, rachel. oh, hi.:::['5-8-210']
wow. love your new nose. jack.:::['5-8-211']
what? dr. wolfson's an artist.:::['5-8-212']
he removed my mole cluster.:::['5-8-213']
want to see?:::['5-8-214']
no, god. please, let me.:::['5-8-215']
happy thanksgiving. hi.:::['5-8-217']
god, your hair sure is different.:::['5-8-218']
yeah, we were just talking about that.:::['5-8-219']
can't we can't believe how stupid we used to look.:::['5-8-220']
so, uh, where's monica?:::['5-8-221']
she's upstairs. monica.:::['5-8-222']
come down, everyone's here.:::['5-8-223']
ross, rachel and the boy who hates thanksgiving.:::['5-8-224']
hi, chandler.:::['5-8-225', '5-17-286', '4-23-238']
is there something on my dress?:::['5-8-228']
you just... you look so different. terrific.:::['5-8-229']
that dress, that body...:::['5-8-230']
dude. sorry.:::['5-8-231', '5-8-240']
yes, yes, monica is thin. it's wonderful.:::['5-8-232']
but what we really want to hear about is ross' new girlfriend.:::['5-8-233']
oh, mom... okay.:::['5-8-234']
um, ahem, her name is carol......and she's really pretty and smart.:::['5-8-235']
and, uh, she's on the lacrosse team and the golf team.:::['5-8-236']
she plays for both teams.:::['5-8-238']
so, chandler, i guess i'll see you at dinner.:::['5-8-239']
that was so awesome.:::['5-8-242']
you totally got him back for calling you fat.:::['5-8-243']
he was just drooling all over you.:::['5-8-244']
that must have felt so great. well, it didn't.:::['5-8-245']
yeah, i mean, i look great.:::['5-8-247']
and yeah, i feel great, and, yeah, my heart's not in trouble anymore.:::['5-8-248']
i just don't feel like i got him back, you know?:::['5-8-250']
i mean, i just want to humiliate him.:::['5-8-251']
i want him to be, like, naked......and i want to point at him:::['5-8-252']
and i wanna laugh.:::['5-8-253']
okay. that, we may be able to do.:::['5-8-254']
well, guys tend to get naked before they're gonna have sex.:::['5-8-256']
what? i mean, i didn't work this hard and lose all this weight......just so i could give my flower:::['5-8-257']
to someone like him.:::['5-8-258']
okay, first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one is ever gonna take it.:::['5-8-259']
and then second of all, you're not gonna actually have sex with him.:::['5-8-260']
you're just gonna make him think that you are.:::['5-8-261']
and then when he's naked......i can throw him out, lock the door......and all our neighbors:::['5-8-263']
will just humiliate him.:::['5-8-264']
and then you will definitely get him back.:::['5-8-265']
okay, so how do i make him think i want to have sex?:::['5-8-266']
uh, oh! here's what you do.:::['5-8-267']
just act like everything around you turns you on.:::['5-8-268']
what do you mean? well, like, anything can be sexy.:::['5-8-269']
like, um... oh, okay. like this dish towel.:::['5-8-270']
this feels so good against my cheek.:::['5-8-272']
and if i get a little hot, i can just dab myself with it.:::['5-8-273']
or i can bring it down to my side and maybe run it through my fingers......while i talk to him.:::['5-8-274']
i can do that. okay, good, good, good.:::['5-8-275']
get busy. he's coming. he's coming.:::['5-8-276']
hey, what's up? hey.:::['5-8-277']
i was wondering if you could make me some mac and cheese......like last year?:::['5-8-278']
i'd love to.:::['5-8-279']
i love macaroni and cheese.:::['5-8-281']
i love the way this box feels against my cheek.:::['5-8-282']
okay. ooh, and i love carrots.:::['5-8-283']
sometimes i like to put them between my fingers.:::['5-8-285']
and hold them down here while i talk to you.:::['5-8-287']
um, and, you know, if i get really hot......um, i like to pick up this knife.:::['5-8-288']
and, um, i put the cool steel......against, um......my body.:::['5-8-289']
what do got? twenty-year-old male.:::['5-8-292']
he's got a severed toe on his right foot.:::['5-8-293']
could you please not do that feet first?:::['5-8-295']
you know where his injury is. severed toe, you just said it!:::['5-8-296']
it says here the knife went right through your shoe.:::['5-8-297']
of course it did. they're made of wicker.:::['5-8-298']
did you bring the toe? oh, yes.:::['5-8-299']
i have it right here on ice.:::['5-8-300']
don't worry, son. we'll just reattach it and then...:::['5-8-301']
what is it? you brought a carrot.:::['5-8-302']
what? this isn't your toe.:::['5-8-303']
this is a small, very cold piece of carrot.:::['5-8-304']
you brought a carrot?:::['5-8-305']
there's a toe in my kitchen.:::['5-8-307']
god, i'm sorry. i'll go back and get it.:::['5-8-308']
it's too late. all we can do is sew up the wound.:::['5-8-309']
without my toe? i need my toe. monica: okay.:::['5-8-310']
no, no, no. i can go really fast. dad, give me the keys to your porsche.:::['5-8-311']
oh, i'm not falling for that one.:::['5-8-312']
that's why i lost my toe? because i called you fat?:::['5-8-313']
i didn't mean to cut it off. it was an accident.:::['5-8-314']
that's why for an entire year people called me sir limps-a-lot?:::['5-8-315']
it wasn't your whole toe.:::['5-8-317']
yeah, well, i miss the tip.:::['5-8-318']
it's the best part.:::['5-8-319']
it has the nail.:::['5-8-320']
monica: chandler...:::['5-8-321']
sir limps-a-lot.:::['5-8-322']
i came up with that.:::['5-8-323']
you're a dork.:::['5-8-324']
i can't believe this. chandler, i said i was sorry.:::['5-8-325']
yeah, well, "sorry" doesn't bring back the little piggy that cried all the way home.:::['5-8-326']
i hate this stupid day and everything about it.:::['5-8-327']
i'll see you later. wait, chandler.:::['5-8-328']
is there anything i can do? anything?:::['5-8-330']
yeah, just leave me alone for a little while.:::['5-8-331']
oh, i'm a duck. i go quack-quack. i'm happy all the time.:::['5-8-332']
look, monica... look.:::['5-8-335']
this is not gonna work.:::['5-8-336']
i bet this will work.:::['5-8-337']
you're so great. i love you.:::['5-8-338']
nothing. i said you're so great, and then i just stopped talking.:::['5-8-340']
monica: you said you loved me. i can't believe this.:::['5-8-341']
monica: you love me.:::['5-8-344']
no, i don't. stop it, stop it, stop it.:::['5-8-345']
gauze!:::['5-8-346']
gauze! i need to get some gauze in here!:::['5-8-347']
can i please get some more gauze?:::['5-8-348']
this is getting ridiculous.:::['5-8-349', '5-17-293']
what am i sitting on?:::['5-9-0', '4-15-9']
top of the world?:::['5-9-1']
dock of the bay?:::['5-9-2']
i'm out.:::['5-9-3', '4-3-192']
oh, ew, undies! oh. rachel: oh!:::['5-9-4']
all right, whose are they?:::['5-9-5']
whose are they? ross: not mine.:::['5-9-6']
joey's. got to be joey's.:::['5-9-7']
they're mine.:::['5-9-8']
see, joey's. they're joe-joe-joey's.:::['5-9-9']
why are they here?:::['5-9-10']
i don't know, uh...:::['5-9-11']
i'm disgusting.:::['5-9-13', '5-9-335']
i take my underwear off in other people's homes.:::['5-9-14']
get them out of here. what's wrong with you?:::['5-9-15']
take them! i got them.:::['5-9-17']
you can touch them. they're yours.:::['5-9-18']
chandler? a word?:::['5-9-19']
i'm tired of covering for you two. this has got to stop. aah.:::['5-9-21']
tighty-whiteys? what are you, 8?:::['5-9-22']
thank you, joey, so much.:::['5-9-23']
you're not welcome, okay?:::['5-9-24']
look, i hate this. you guys keep embarrassing me.:::['5-9-25']
yesterday, rachel found your razor in our bathroom.:::['5-9-26']
i said it was mine, and that i was playing a woman in a play.:::['5-9-27']
then one thing led to another and...:::['5-9-28']
and around the ankles, that is a tough spot.:::['5-9-29']
it was. all right, listen...:::['5-9-30']
all this lying has been hard on us too.:::['5-9-31']
yeah, i bet all the sex makes it easier.:::['5-9-32']
yeah, actually.:::['5-9-33']
we'll be more careful.:::['5-9-34']
we don't want them to know, because it's going really well.:::['5-9-35']
and maybe it's going well because it's a secret.:::['5-9-36']
it sounds weird, but we're so bad at relationships.:::['5-9-37']
we are. help us. help.:::['5-9-38']
all right. but you do it with me once.:::['5-9-39']
didn't think so.:::['5-9-41']
monica: hey, phoebe. chandler: hey, pheebs.:::['5-9-42']
what are you reading?:::['5-9-43', '3-12-92']
um, wuthering heights.:::['5-9-44']
i have to finish it by tomorrow for my literature class.:::['5-9-45']
you're taking a class? that's so cool.:::['5-9-46']
i really liked that lamaze class i took.:::['5-9-47']
i thought this time i'd go for something more intellectual......with a less painful final exam.:::['5-9-48']
oh, you should come with me!:::['5-9-50']
then i'll have someone to sit with.:::['5-9-51']
yay! okay. ooh, but, do you have time to read it?:::['5-9-53']
i read it in school.:::['5-9-54']
this is going to be so much fun! shh. i have to finish.:::['5-9-55']
what's wrong, buddy?:::['5-9-57']
someone at work ate my sandwich.:::['5-9-58']
what did the police say?:::['5-9-59']
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich.:::['5-9-60']
i can't believe someone ate it.:::['5-9-61']
it's just a sandwich.:::['5-9-62']
just a sandwich?:::['5-9-63']
i am 30 years old, okay?:::['5-9-64']
i'll be divorced twice and i got evicted.:::['5-9-65']
that sandwich was the only good thing in my life!:::['5-9-66']
someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!:::['5-9-67']
i have enough for one more sandwich.:::['5-9-68']
i was going to eat it myself, but...:::['5-9-69']
mon, that would be incredible. thank you so much.:::['5-9-70']
i still can't believe someone ate it!:::['5-9-71']
look, i left a note and everything.:::['5-9-72']
"knock-knock." "who's there?":::['5-9-73']
"ross geller's lunch.":::['5-9-74']
"ross geller's lunch, who?":::['5-9-75']
"ross geller's lunch. please don't take me. okay?":::['5-9-76']
i'm surprised you didn't wear it home. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-9-77']
want to keep your food? scare people off.:::['5-9-78']
i learned that on the street.:::['5-9-79']
what would you say, pheebs?:::['5-9-81']
stuff like, uh, "keep your mitts off my grub.":::['5-9-82']
do you picture phoebe on the street with the entire cast of annie?:::['5-9-83']
this'll keep them away from your stuff.:::['5-9-84']
all: whoa!:::['5-9-85']
phoebe, you are a badass!:::['5-9-86']
someday i'll tell you how i stabbed the cop.:::['5-9-87']
phoebe. he stabbed me first!:::['5-9-88']
the brontë sisters were remarkable women for their time.:::['5-9-89']
they lived in a patriarchal society.:::['5-9-90']
sorry i'm late, but i left late.:::['5-9-91']
ahem. okay.:::['5-9-92', '4-19-176']
so, what is the book about?:::['5-9-93']
didn't you read it in high school?:::['5-9-94']
i started it, but then there was this pep rally.:::['5-9-95']
and i was on top of the pyramid.:::['5-9-96']
but anyway, um......what's the book about?:::['5-9-97']
it's a tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff.:::['5-9-98']
it takes place on these creepy moors in england.:::['5-9-99']
which i think represent the wildness of heathcliff's character.:::['5-9-100']
i totally get symbolism.:::['5-9-101']
how would you characterize the theme of this book?:::['5-9-102']
uh, let's see... rachel green?:::['5-9-103']
ahem, um...:::['5-9-104', '3-6-325']
i would have to say that it's a tragic love story.:::['5-9-105']
that's sort of a given......but, yes. anyone else?:::['5-9-106']
oh, oh, oh. symbolism!:::['5-9-107']
and the wildness of the moors......which i think, is mirrored......in the wildness:::['5-9-108']
of, uh, heathcliff's character.:::['5-9-109']
excellent! what rachel has shrewdly observed here...:::['5-9-110']
you completely stole my answer!:::['5-9-111']
honey, that was pretty obvious.:::['5-9-112']
how would you know? you didn't read it!:::['5-9-113']
what do you think? uh, you in the blue shirt?:::['5-9-114']
i think that, um, yours is a question with many possible answers.:::['5-9-115']
would you care to venture one?:::['5-9-116']
are you just repeating me?:::['5-9-117']
all right. let's move on.:::['5-9-118']
why didn't you say you hadn't read the book?:::['5-9-120']
i didn't want him to think i was stupid.:::['5-9-121']
that was really embarrassing, what happened to you.:::['5-9-122']
phoebe! phoebe! yeah?:::['5-9-123']
your note?:::['5-9-124']
amazing!:::['5-9-125']
not only did no one touch my sandwich......but people at work are:::['5-9-126']
actually afraid of me.:::['5-9-127']
a guy called me "mental.":::['5-9-128']
"mental geller.":::['5-9-129']
i've always wanted a cool nickname like that.:::['5-9-130']
the best you got in high school was, uh, "wet pants geller.":::['5-9-131']
it was the water fountain, okay?:::['5-9-132']
anyway......people are writing reports for me......uh, pushing back deadlines:::['5-9-133']
to fit my schedule.:::['5-9-134']
i tell you, you get tough with people......and you can get anything you want.:::['5-9-135']
hey, tribbiani! give me that coffee! now!:::['5-9-136']
this was really fun.:::['5-9-137']
i've been wondering if you'd ask me out.:::['5-9-138']
so you, uh, still wondering?:::['5-9-139']
no. we just went out.:::['5-9-140']
you're smart.:::['5-9-141']
oh, candles!:::['5-9-144']
what is that, a blanket?:::['5-9-145']
a video camera? oh, my god!:::['5-9-146']
no, no, no. wait.:::['5-9-147']
i can't believe you thought you'd tape us having sex on the first date!:::['5-9-148']
joey, is what she just said, um...:::['5-9-150']
you're actually going...:::['5-9-152']
what is going on here?:::['5-9-153']
and with chandler in the next room. what are you, sick?:::['5-9-154']
i mean, i'm disgusting.:::['5-9-156']
i make low-budget adult films.:::['5-9-157']
you promised to be more careful!:::['5-9-159']
the good joey name's been dragged through the mud!:::['5-9-160']
i'm telling everyone.:::['5-9-162']
it's the only explanation that doesn't make me look like a pig!:::['5-9-163']
no, there's a better explanation.:::['5-9-164']
tell them you had to make an adult film for your......adult film class.:::['5-9-165']
i like that. but no!:::['5-9-166']
how does that explain my underwear at your place?:::['5-9-167']
get ready to come out of the non-gay closet.:::['5-9-169']
i promise to come up with something. just give us time.:::['5-9-170']
but it better make me look really good.:::['5-9-172']
and another thing::::['5-9-173']
the video camera?:::['5-9-174']
may i have a word?:::['5-9-177']
of course, donald.:::['5-9-178']
we've been getting reports of very angry behavior on your part.:::['5-9-179']
what? threatening letters......refusal to meet deadlines.:::['5-9-180']
apparently people now call you mental.:::['5-9-181']
we want you to speak to a psychiatrist.:::['5-9-183']
oh, no. uh, you...:::['5-9-184']
you don't understand. this is so silly.:::['5-9-185']
um, this is all just because of a sandwich.:::['5-9-186']
a sandwich?:::['5-9-187']
you see, my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches.:::['5-9-188']
her secret is, she puts an extra slice of gravy-soaked bread in the middle.:::['5-9-189']
i call it "the moistmaker.":::['5-9-190']
anyway, i put my sandwich in the fridge...:::['5-9-191']
ha-ha-ha. oh, you know what?:::['5-9-192']
i believe i ate that.:::['5-9-194']
you ate my sandwich?:::['5-9-195']
a simple mistake. it can happen to anyone.:::['5-9-196']
did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moistmaker?:::['5-9-198']
do you, perhaps, remember......seeing a note on top of it?:::['5-9-200']
there may have been a joke or limerick of some kind.:::['5-9-201']
that said it was......my sandwich!:::['5-9-202']
look in my office. some may be in the trash.:::['5-9-204']
it was quite large. i had to throw most of it away.:::['5-9-206']
my sandwich?:::['5-9-208']
what's this book about?:::['5-9-210']
you didn't read it, either?:::['5-9-211']
i was going to, but i, uh, accidentally read something else.:::['5-9-212']
what? vogue.:::['5-9-213']
so tell me about jane eyre.:::['5-9-214']
no, read it yourself.:::['5-9-215']
come on, don't be such a goody-goody.:::['5-9-216']
all right. so jane eyre?:::['5-9-218']
first you'd think she's a woman, but she's not.:::['5-9-219']
she's a cyborg.:::['5-9-220']
a cyborg? isn't that like a robot?:::['5-9-221']
this book was light years ahead of its time.:::['5-9-222']
instructor: sorry i'm late. let's get started.:::['5-9-223']
what did you think of jane eyre?:::['5-9-224']
um, rachel and i were discussing it, and she had very interesting insights.:::['5-9-225']
go ahead, rachel.:::['5-9-226']
um, thank you, phoebe.:::['5-9-227']
what struck me most when reading jane eyre......was, uh, how the book was:::['5-9-228']
so ahead of its time.:::['5-9-229']
if you're talking about feminism, i think you're right.:::['5-9-230']
well, feminism, yes. but also the robots.:::['5-9-231']
since that video camera thing didn't work out......i thought that i would give you:::['5-9-233']
just a little preview.:::['5-9-234']
you're naked!:::['5-9-235']
monica!:::['5-9-239', '3-2-318', '3-6-120']
i saw a psychiatrist at work today.:::['5-9-242']
on account of my rage.:::['5-9-244']
which, if i may say, right now is out of control.:::['5-9-245']
he gave me a pill for it.:::['5-9-246']
a pill?:::['5-9-247']
uh-huh. when the psychiatrist told me to take a leave of absence......because i yelled at my boss,i started to get worked up again.:::['5-9-248']
so he offered me a tranquilizer.:::['5-9-249']
and i thought it was a good idea.:::['5-9-250']
so i took it.:::['5-9-251']
they're making you take time off work?:::['5-9-252']
and you're okay with that?:::['5-9-253']
it's going to be weird not having a job for a while.:::['5-9-255']
but i definitely don't care about my sandwich.:::['5-9-256']
it's so embarrassing! i can't believe you let me go on like that!:::['5-9-257']
it was so funny when you compared jane eyre to robocop.:::['5-9-259']
that was not funny!:::['5-9-260']
i snapped, okay? you weren't taking the class seriously.:::['5-9-261']
come on! what is the big deal?:::['5-9-262']
i thought it'd be something we could do together.:::['5-9-263']
i thought it would be fun.:::['5-9-264']
fun is good.:::['5-9-265']
but i also wanted to learn.:::['5-9-266']
people talk about what they learned in high school. i never went.:::['5-9-267']
so you really wanted to learn.:::['5-9-269']
you know, pheebs, i just wanted to have fun.:::['5-9-270']
you know who should go?:::['5-9-271']
i know! i know! i know!:::['5-9-272']
monica, you asked the question.:::['5-9-273']
oh, my god, that's monica!:::['5-9-275']
oh, no, no, no!:::['5-9-276']
you get away from me, you sick, sick, sicko!:::['5-9-277']
joey has got a secret peephole!:::['5-9-279']
oh, no, no, no, no!:::['5-9-280']
he has a naked picture of monica!:::['5-9-281']
he takes naked pictures of us, then he eats chicken and looks at them!:::['5-9-282']
look. oh! dude, that's my sister!:::['5-9-283']
give me that!:::['5-9-284']
wait! everybody calm down, okay?:::['5-9-285']
let's give our friend a chance to explain why he's such a big pervert!:::['5-9-286']
i am not a pervert, okay?:::['5-9-287']
i just kind of...:::['5-9-289']
i think i can explain this.:::['5-9-290']
joey's a sex addict.:::['5-9-292']
what? no, i'm not!:::['5-9-293']
it's okay! it's good!:::['5-9-294']
it's a disease.:::['5-9-295']
i am not a sex addict!:::['5-9-296']
yes, you are!:::['5-9-297']
that's the only way to explain all this stuff!:::['5-9-298']
no, it isn't. it's not.:::['5-9-299']
because you could also explain it with the truth!:::['5-9-300']
what is the truth?:::['5-9-301']
what's up? what's going on?:::['5-9-302']
i slept with monica.:::['5-9-303']
well, let's see what everybody thinks of that.:::['5-9-304']
you slept with my sister?:::['5-9-306']
uh, yes, but it was...:::['5-9-307']
we just did it once, uh, in london.:::['5-9-308']
this is not good for my rage.:::['5-9-309']
of course, it's true.:::['5-9-312']
how else would you explain all the weird stuff that's been going on?:::['5-9-313']
yes, it's true.:::['5-9-314']
if it happened once, how come we found your underwear in our apartment?:::['5-9-315']
uh... oh!:::['5-9-316']
that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london.:::['5-9-317']
right, monica?:::['5-9-318']
i guess i wanted to keep it......as a souvenir.:::['5-9-319']
my god, monica!:::['5-9-320']
are you sure you're not just a sex addict?:::['5-9-321']
if anyone's a sex addict here, it's monica.:::['5-9-323']
she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!:::['5-9-324']
that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.:::['5-9-325']
that makes sense.:::['5-9-326']
and the video camera?:::['5-9-327']
uh, monica?:::['5-9-328']
i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey.:::['5-9-329']
but, sadly, i could not be enticed.:::['5-9-330']
unbelievable!:::['5-9-331']
you really kept joey's underwear?:::['5-9-332']
i stalk guys and keep their underpants.:::['5-9-336']
i think we've all learned who's disgusting and who's not.:::['5-9-338']
now, i'm going to get back to my bucket.:::['5-9-341']
i'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.:::['5-9-342']
you were making a good point.:::['5-9-343']
i mean, till you got cut off.:::['5-9-344']
what's up with that girl monica?:::['5-9-345']
i don't know. i didn't come with her.:::['5-9-346']
hey, everybody! everybody, guess what!:::['5-9-347']
i just convinced carl to give us a test.:::['5-9-348']
test?:::['5-9-349']
come on! tests make us all better learners!:::['5-9-350']
oh, yeah! we should have essay questions!:::['5-9-351']
monica: come in.:::['5-4-0']
i've been waiting for you.:::['5-4-1']
rachel: hi, i just...:::['5-4-2']
ah! oh, my god! monica!:::['5-4-3']
i'm sorry! i was...:::['5-4-5']
i was taking a nap.:::['5-4-6']
since when do you take naps in that position?:::['5-4-7']
tell me you were waiting for a guy. please tell me.:::['5-4-8']
yes, i was. a guy.:::['5-4-9']
i'm seeing a guy from work! ha!:::['5-4-11']
that cute waiter guy from your restaurant.:::['5-4-12']
the one that looks like a non-threatening ray liotta?:::['5-4-13']
aha. that one!:::['5-4-14']
give me a second. i'll be out of your hair. i'm just going to grab a jacket.:::['5-4-15']
when i get back, i want every little detail.:::['5-4-16']
okay, um... okay, um...:::['5-4-18']
it's just joey and ross.:::['5-4-19']
why aren't you at the movie?:::['5-4-20']
we were, but ross was talking so loud on his phone, they threw us out.:::['5-4-21']
i had to talk loud because the movie was loud!:::['5-4-22']
he's talking to london. did he get in touch with emily?:::['5-4-23']
no. he's calling everyone on her side of the family......hoping someone:::['5-4-24']
will help him get in touch with her.:::['5-4-25']
i don't care if i said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!:::['5-4-26']
way to suck up to the family!:::['5-4-28']
i'm so glad you're all here. my office finally got wrinkle-free fax paper!:::['5-4-29']
hey oh, no, no! vomit tux! no, no! vomit tux!:::['5-4-30']
don't worry, i had it dry-cleaned.:::['5-4-31']
vomit tux?:::['5-4-32']
who vomited on...:::['5-4-33']
you know what? what you up to, joe?:::['5-4-34']
they're doing this telethon thing on tv.:::['5-4-35']
and my agent got me a job as co-host!:::['5-4-36']
a little good deed for pbs, plus some tv exposure.:::['5-4-38']
that's the kind of math joey likes to do.:::['5-4-39']
oh, pbs!:::['5-4-40']
what's wrong with pbs? what's right with them?:::['5-4-41']
why don't you like pbs?:::['5-4-42']
right after my mom killed herself, i was in this bad place, you know, personally.:::['5-4-43']
so i just thought it would make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street.:::['5-4-44']
because they were so nice when i was a little kid.:::['5-4-45']
no one ever wrote back.:::['5-4-46']
a lot of those muppets don't have thumbs.:::['5-4-47']
all i got was a lousy keychain, and by that time, i was living in a box.:::['5-4-48']
i didn't have keys!:::['5-4-49']
i'm sorry, pheebs.:::['5-4-50']
i just wanted to do a good deed, like you did with the babies.:::['5-4-51']
this isn't a good deed. you just want to get on tv. this is totally selfish.:::['5-4-52']
what about you having those babies for your brother?:::['5-4-54']
talk about selfish!:::['5-4-55']
it was a nice thing, but it made you feel good, right?:::['5-4-57']
it made you feel good so that makes it selfish.:::['5-4-59']
look, there's no unselfish good deeds. sorry.:::['5-4-60']
yes, there are totally good deeds that are selfless!:::['5-4-61']
may i ask for one example?:::['5-4-62']
yeah, it's... you know, there's...:::['5-4-63']
no, you may not!:::['5-4-64']
that's because all people are selfish.:::['5-4-65']
are you calling me selfish?:::['5-4-66']
are you calling you people?:::['5-4-67']
sorry to burst that bubble, pheebs, but selfless good deeds don't exist.:::['5-4-68']
and you know the deal on santa claus, right?:::['5-4-70']
i'm gonna find a selfless good deed. i'm going to beat you, you evil genius!:::['5-4-71']
hello? hello, ross?:::['5-4-72']
emily?:::['5-4-73']
oh, my god! it's emily!:::['5-4-74']
it's emily, everyone! shh! shh! shh!:::['5-4-75']
i'm only ringing to say stop harassing my relatives. goodbye.:::['5-4-77']
wait! okay, okay, you can hang up, but i'll keep calling everyone in england......if that's what it takes:::['5-4-78']
to get you to talk to me.:::['5-4-79']
really? about what?:::['5-4-80']
look, you're my wife. we're married.:::['5-4-81']
you know, i love you.:::['5-4-82']
i really miss you.:::['5-4-83']
i miss you too.:::['5-4-84']
well, at least i think i do.:::['5-4-85']
she's talking.:::['5-4-86']
when you said "the deal with santa claus," you meant?:::['5-4-87']
that he doesn't exist.:::['5-4-88']
chandler, have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend?:::['5-4-90']
yeah, she might have mentioned him.:::['5-4-91']
so, mon, when are we going to meet this new, secret waiter man?:::['5-4-92']
he's really shy. i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.:::['5-4-93']
yeah, i don't think he's up to meeting everyone yet.:::['5-4-94']
i don't care, i wanna meet this guy who's the best sex she ever had.:::['5-4-95']
that's what you heard? you said that?:::['5-4-97']
i might have said that.:::['5-4-98']
why is that funny?:::['5-4-99']
because i'm very happy for him.:::['5-4-100']
and you! you lucky dog!:::['5-4-101']
well, emily's willing to work on the relationship.:::['5-4-103']
that's great! yes!:::['5-4-104']
in london.:::['5-4-105']
what? she wants me to move to london.:::['5-4-106']
but you live here.:::['5-4-107']
you know that.:::['5-4-108']
i bet if i talked to carol and susan......i could convince them:::['5-4-110']
to move to london with ben.:::['5-4-111']
i'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move to another country......so you can patch things up:::['5-4-112']
with your new wife.:::['5-4-113']
it could happen.:::['5-4-114']
how you doing? welcome. good to see you.:::['5-4-115']
this'll be your phone.:::['5-4-116']
but i'm not really expecting a lot of calls.:::['5-4-118']
no, you answer it and take pledges.:::['5-4-119']
but i'm the host.:::['5-4-120']
no, gary collins is the host. you'll be answering the phone.:::['5-4-121']
you don't seem to understand. see, i was dr. drake ramoray.:::['5-4-122']
well, here's your phone, doctor.:::['5-4-123']
i can't believe i can't find a selfless good deed.:::['5-4-124']
you know that really old guy that lives next door to me?:::['5-4-125']
i snuck over there and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop.:::['5-4-126']
but he caught me, and he force-fed me cider and cookies.:::['5-4-127']
then i felt wonderful. that old jackass!:::['5-4-128']
maybe joey's right. maybe all good deeds are selfish.:::['5-4-129']
i will find a selfless good deed. because i just gave birth to three children......and i will not let them be raised:::['5-4-130']
in a world where joey's right!:::['5-4-131']
hey, monica? can i ask you a cooking question?:::['5-4-132']
sure. if you're cooking on the stove......does that mean that your new secret:::['5-4-133']
boyfriend is better in bed than richard?:::['5-4-134']
rachel: chandler.:::['5-4-135', '4-3-35', '4-3-225']
is he?:::['5-4-136']
i think i'm going to respect the privacy of my new, secret boyfriend.:::['5-4-137']
if this guy was me......and it's me who'd learned that it was:::['5-4-139']
me who was the best you'd ever had......i'd be going like this::::['5-4-140']
all right, emily.:::['5-4-141']
as much as i love you......i'm sorry, i can't:::['5-4-142']
move to london without ben.:::['5-4-143']
i understand that would be difficult.:::['5-4-144']
would you consider moving here? you were moving here anyway.:::['5-4-145']
why can't you just do that?:::['5-4-146']
i don't know. it's just...:::['5-4-147']
okay, okay, but i know that even though i've been a complete idiot up till now......you have to come here.:::['5-4-148']
you have to, so we can work this out together.:::['5-4-149']
all right? did you just say "all right"?:::['5-4-151']
i did. now i'm the idiot.:::['5-4-152']
emily, that is so great!:::['5-4-153']
it'll be great!:::['5-4-154']
we're going to be like two idiots in love!:::['5-4-155']
ross, there's one thing that really scares me still.:::['5-4-156']
yes, tell me. you have to understand......how humiliating it was:::['5-4-157']
for me up on that altar......in front of my entire family,all my friends.:::['5-4-158']
i know. i am so sorry.:::['5-4-159']
and then, after deciding to forgive you......seeing you at the airport,catching our plane with her.:::['5-4-160']
again, very sorry.:::['5-4-161']
i mean, i can't be in the same room as her.:::['5-4-162']
it drives me mad thinking of you being in the same room as her.:::['5-4-163']
emily, there is nothing between rachel and me.:::['5-4-164']
i'll come to new york and we'll try to make this work.:::['5-4-168']
that is so great!:::['5-4-169']
as long as you don't see rachel anymore.:::['5-4-170']
i asked emily if she would come to new york.:::['5-4-171']
and she said yes.:::['5-4-172']
monica: great! no, no, no.:::['5-4-173']
only if i promise never to see rachel again.:::['5-4-174']
monica: what? you can't...:::['5-4-175']
what did you tell her?:::['5-4-176']
i told her i'd have to think about it.:::['5-4-177']
i mean, how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision?:::['5-4-178']
i'm actually asking you!:::['5-4-179']
well, you can't just not see rachel anymore.:::['5-4-180']
she's one of your best friends.:::['5-4-181']
but he can't not see emily, i mean that's his wife!:::['5-4-182']
that's true! yeah, right?:::['5-4-183']
but you've known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life.:::['5-4-184']
that's true! monica: no, you cannot.:::['5-4-185']
thanks for the help. problem solved!:::['5-4-186']
oh, hey, joey. we've been watching all day. when are you gonna be on tv?:::['5-4-188']
there was kind of a mix-up in my agent's office......but i'm still on tv,and that's good exposure.:::['5-4-189']
you're not on tv.:::['5-4-190']
oh, okay. how about now?:::['5-4-191']
yeah! there he is! there he is!:::['5-4-192']
joey: hello, new york!:::['5-4-193']
emeril: maybe just put the whole duck right in there. who cares?:::['5-4-194']
now i got the legs. aw! aw!:::['5-4-195']
how many times have i told you guys to never watch the cooking channel?:::['5-4-196']
hi, chandler. hey.:::['5-4-197']
listen, i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day.:::['5-4-198']
that was yours?:::['5-4-199']
we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars.:::['5-4-200']
williams-sonoma, fall catalog, page 27.:::['5-4-201']
expect it in 4 to 6 weeks.:::['5-4-202']
hey. joey's gonna be at the telethon for the rest of the day.:::['5-4-203']
we have the whole place to ourselves.:::['5-4-204']
just thought maybe you'd want to book some time with "the best you've ever had.":::['5-4-206']
you know what, champ?:::['5-4-207']
i think i'll pass.:::['5-4-208']
what's your point?:::['5-4-210']
pbs telethon.:::['5-4-211', '5-4-254']
i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed.:::['5-4-213']
i went down to the park and i let a bee sting me.:::['5-4-214']
what good is that going to do anybody?:::['5-4-215']
it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends.:::['5-4-216']
the bee is happy, and i am definitely not.:::['5-4-217']
you know, the bee probably died after he stung you.:::['5-4-218']
back on in 30 seconds, people!:::['5-4-220']
excuse me, would you mind switching with me?:::['5-4-221']
no way. i'm in the shot, man.:::['5-4-222']
you've been here all day! i'm taking pledges.:::['5-4-223']
and we're on three, two...:::['5-4-224']
welcome back to our fall telethon.:::['5-4-225']
if you've been enjoying the performance of cirque du soleil......and you'd like to see more of the same:::['5-4-226']
kind of programming, it's very simple.:::['5-4-227']
all you have to do is call in and pledge......and at that time tell one of our volunteers:::['5-4-228']
what type of programming you...:::['5-4-229']
that's it. i cannot make this decision. it is too difficult.:::['5-4-231']
so i'm just going leave it entirely up to the gods of fate.:::['5-4-232']
a magic 8 ball?:::['5-4-233']
you can't make this decision with a toy!:::['5-4-234']
it's not a toy.:::['5-4-235']
i don't know what else to do!:::['5-4-236']
i either keep my wife and lose one of my best friends......or i keep my friend and get divorced:::['5-4-237']
for the second time before i'm 30.:::['5-4-238']
so if anyone else has a better suggestion, let's hear it.:::['5-4-239']
because i got nothing! don't be shy.:::['5-4-240']
any suggestion will do.:::['5-4-241']
magic 8 ball......should i never see rachel again?:::['5-4-244']
"ask again later.":::['5-4-245', '5-4-247']
later is not good enough!:::['5-4-246']
this is broken! it is broken!:::['5-4-249']
will chandler have sex tonight?:::['5-4-251']
"don't count on lt.":::['5-4-252']
seems like it works to me.:::['5-4-253']
phoebe: hi, joey.:::['5-4-255']
i'd like to make a pledge.:::['5-4-257']
i would like to donate $200.:::['5-4-258']
two hundred dollars?:::['5-4-259']
you sure? after what sesame street did to you?:::['5-4-260']
i'm still mad at them, but i also know that they bring happiness......to lots of kids:::['5-4-261']
whose moms didn't kill themselves.:::['5-4-262']
you know, so......by supporting them, i'm doing a good:::['5-4-263']
thing, but i'm not happy about it.:::['5-4-264']
so there! a selfless good deed.:::['5-4-265']
and you don't feel a little good about donating the money?:::['5-4-266']
no, it sucks. i was saving up to buy a hamster.:::['5-4-267']
a hamster? those things are, like, 10 bucks.:::['5-4-268']
not the one i had my eye on.:::['5-4-269']
it looks like we have surpassed last year's pledge total.:::['5-4-270']
and the pledge that did it was taken by one of our volunteers.:::['5-4-272']
oh, boy! and may i say, one of our sharpest dressed volunteers.:::['5-4-273']
mr. joseph tribbiani!:::['5-4-274']
phoebe: oh, look!:::['5-4-275']
joey's on tv!:::['5-4-276']
my pledge got joey on tv! that makes me feel so...:::['5-4-278']
look......maybe i got carried away before,but there's something you gotta know.:::['5-4-280']
if i'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.:::['5-4-281']
i was nothing before you.:::['5-4-283']
call the other girls and ask.:::['5-4-284']
which wouldn't take long.:::['5-4-285']
but when i'm with you, and we're together......oh, my god!:::['5-4-286']
really? oh, my god!:::['5-4-287']
now, i understand if you never want to sleep with me again.:::['5-4-288']
but that would be wrong.:::['5-4-289']
we're too good.:::['5-4-290']
we owe it to sex!:::['5-4-291']
well, if we owe it!:::['5-4-292']
oh, my!:::['5-4-293']
when is joey gonna be home?:::['5-4-294']
i was kind of hoping we could do this without him.:::['5-4-295']
no, no, no! leave the gloves on.:::['5-4-296']
but i just cleaned the bathroom.:::['5-4-297']
yeah, why don't we lose the gloves? yeah.:::['5-4-298']
all right. let's show them how it's done.:::['5-4-299']
okay. ow!:::['5-4-300']
that wasn't part of it. i know.:::['5-4-301']
hi. you ready? we're going to be late.:::['5-4-302']
for what? for stella, remember?:::['5-4-303']
she's getting her groove back in 20 minutes.:::['5-4-304']
yeah, i totally forgot about that.:::['5-4-305']
mind if i take a rain check? i'm waiting for a call from emily.:::['5-4-306']
sure, i guess.:::['5-4-307']
hey, i hear you don't have to go to london. yay.:::['5-4-308']
it's not that easy. there's still a lot of relationship stuff.:::['5-4-309']
just stuff.:::['5-4-311']
you know, kind of what emily wants.:::['5-4-312']
why don't you talk to me about it? maybe i can help.:::['5-4-313']
no, no, you can't help.:::['5-4-314']
i mean, i kind of have to do this without your help.:::['5-4-315']
i know you can do that too. i'm just saying if you need somebody to talk to...:::['5-4-317']
ross, look, whatever this relationship stuff is that emily wants......just give it to her.:::['5-4-320']
the bottom line is that you love her.:::['5-4-321']
so just fix whatever she wants fixed.:::['5-4-322']
just do it.:::['5-4-323', '3-11-286']
you're going to have to try. you'll just hate yourself if you don't.:::['5-4-324']
come on, answer it! it's driving me crazy.:::['5-4-325']
hi, sweetie.:::['5-4-327', '5-13-113']
look. yes, i've been thinking......about that thing:::['5-4-329']
you wanted me to do......and i can do it.:::['5-4-330']
so will you come to new york?:::['5-4-331']
never done that before. nope.:::['5-4-333']
hey. hey, ha, ha.:::['5-5-0']
joey: monica?:::['5-5-1']
what time is it?:::['5-5-2']
uh, 9.:::['5-5-3']
but it's dark out.:::['5-5-4']
um, well, that's because you always sleep till noon, silly.:::['5-5-5']
this is what 9 looks like.:::['5-5-6']
i guess i'll get washed up then.:::['5-5-7']
watch that sunrise.:::['5-5-8']
i'm really getting tired of sneaking around all the time.:::['5-5-9']
i know, me too. hey, what if we went away for the whole weekend? no interruptions.:::['5-5-10']
and we could be naked the entire time.:::['5-5-11']
all weekend?:::['5-5-12']
that's a whole lot of naked. mm-hm.:::['5-5-13']
yeah, i could say i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.:::['5-5-14']
oh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair in jersey!:::['5-5-15']
ha, ha, okay. you know you're not, though.:::['5-5-16']
right. okay. let's go.:::['5-5-17']
wait. what about joey?:::['5-5-18']
hey, guess what i'm doing this weekend.:::['5-5-19']
going to this culinary fair in jersey.:::['5-5-20']
how weird! chandler just told us he's got a conference there. huh.:::['5-5-21']
oh, that's funny, ha, ha. seems like chandler's conference could've been......in connecticut or vermont.:::['5-5-22']
i'm not in charge of where the conference is held.:::['5-5-23']
do you want people to think it's a fake conference? it's a real conference.:::['5-5-24']
hey. joey & monica: hey.:::['5-5-25']
is rachel here? i gotta talk to her. no, she's out shopping.:::['5-5-26']
damn. chandler: what's going on?:::['5-5-27']
i told emily to come.:::['5-5-28']
and i just need to, you know, talk to rachel about it.:::['5-5-29']
so when emily comes, you're not gonna see rachel anymore?:::['5-5-31']
i'm focusing on the "i get to see my wife" part, all right......and not on the part:::['5-5-32']
that makes me do this, huh?:::['5-5-33']
so you'll never be in the same room together? how is that even gonna work?:::['5-5-34']
i have no idea. i mean...:::['5-5-35']
but i assure you, i will figure it out.:::['5-5-36']
it doesn't seem like it's gonna work.:::['5-5-37']
hi, guys. hi.:::['5-5-38']
we're flipping monica's mattress.:::['5-5-41']
so i'm thinking, basically, we pick it up, and then we flip it.:::['5-5-42']
that's better than my way.:::['5-5-43']
oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?:::['5-5-44']
chandler: oh, man. phoebe: oh.:::['5-5-45']
oh, look! a letter from my mom.:::['5-5-46']
so, rach?:::['5-5-47']
you know how emily's coming, right?:::['5-5-48']
oh, yeah. i know.:::['5-5-49']
can you hear anything?:::['5-5-50']
oh, yeah, somebody just said, "can you hear anything?":::['5-5-51']
hey, joey's ass.:::['5-5-52']
remember when they got in that big fight and broke up......and we were all stuck in here:::['5-5-54']
all night with no food?:::['5-5-55']
well, when ross said "rachel" at the wedding, i figured it was gonna happen again.:::['5-5-56']
you know? so i hid this in here.:::['5-5-57']
ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...:::['5-5-58']
ooh, mad libs. mine!:::['5-5-59']
condoms?:::['5-5-60']
hey, you don't know how long we're gonna be in here.:::['5-5-61']
we may have to re-populate the earth.:::['5-5-62']
and condoms are the way to do that?:::['5-5-63']
anyway, it all boils down to this.:::['5-5-64']
the last time i talked to emily... aah! oh, my god! our dog died!:::['5-5-65']
what? oh, my god. lapooh, our dog!:::['5-5-66']
lapooh's still alive?:::['5-5-67']
oh! it says he was hit by an ice-cream truck and dragged for......19 blocks!:::['5-5-68']
oh! oh, my god. sweetie, we heard you crying.:::['5-5-69']
please don't cry. it's lapooh!:::['5-5-70']
i know, it's lapooh right now but it'll get better.:::['5-5-71']
i can't believe it! we're here!:::['5-5-72']
ooh, chocolates on the pillows! oh, i love that!:::['5-5-73']
you should live with joey. rolos everywhere.:::['5-5-74']
oh. okay, i'll be right back. okay.:::['5-5-75']
chandler: oh, yes!:::['5-5-76']
monica, get in here. it's a high-speed car chase on!:::['5-5-77']
we're switching rooms.:::['5-5-78']
oh, dear god, they gave us glasses!:::['5-5-79']
no, they gave us glasses with lipstick on them.:::['5-5-80']
if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.:::['5-5-81']
oh, come on, sweetie. i just want this weekend to be perfect, okay?:::['5-5-82']
we can change rooms, can't we? okay.:::['5-5-83']
okay, but let's do it now, though, because chopper 5 just lost its feed!:::['5-5-84']
hey, so, uh...:::['5-5-85']
you know how there was something i wanted to talk to you about?:::['5-5-86']
well......you know i'm trying to work:::['5-5-88']
things out with emily.:::['5-5-89']
well, there's this......one thing.:::['5-5-91']
i made a promise that... oh, hey.:::['5-5-93']
what? your nose is bleeding.:::['5-5-94']
oh, god! you're bleeding.:::['5-5-95']
ah. ah, not again.:::['5-5-96']
this happened when my grandfather died.:::['5-5-97']
it's... ugh, sorry.:::['5-5-98']
oh, gross, unh.:::['5-5-99']
okay. so i'm sorry. what did you wanna tell me?:::['5-5-100']
um... ugh.:::['5-5-101']
i can't see you anymore.:::['5-5-105']
yeah, i know, it's ridiculous. i can't see you, either.:::['5-5-106']
i think you'll find this room more to your liking.:::['5-5-107']
they say he's only got half a tank left.:::['5-5-109']
half a tank? we still got a lot of high-speed chasing to do!:::['5-5-110']
we're switching rooms again. what? why?:::['5-5-111']
this is a garden-view room and we paid for an ocean-view room.:::['5-5-112']
our last ocean-view room was unacceptable to you.:::['5-5-113']
excuse me. um, can i talk to you over here for just a second?:::['5-5-114']
chandler. yeah?:::['5-5-116']
look, these clowns are trying to take us for a ride. i won't let them.:::['5-5-117']
we're not a couple of suckers.:::['5-5-118']
i hear you, mugsy.:::['5-5-119']
but, look, all these rooms are fine.:::['5-5-120']
okay? can you just pick one so i can watch the...:::['5-5-121']
have a perfect, magical weekend together with you?:::['5-5-122']
okay, this one i like. nothing.:::['5-5-123']
nothing. it's over.:::['5-5-124']
damn it, this is regularly scheduled programming!:::['5-5-125']
can we turn the tv off, okay?:::['5-5-126']
do we really wanna spend the weekend like this?:::['5-5-127']
i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room-switching fun?:::['5-5-128']
ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight. who should i blame?:::['5-5-129']
the nice bellman who had to drag our luggage to 10 rooms?:::['5-5-130']
or the idiot who thought he could drive......from albany to canada:::['5-5-131']
on a half a tank of gas?:::['5-5-132']
do not speak ill of the dead.:::['5-5-133']
we're supposed to be spending a romantic weekend together.:::['5-5-134']
i just wanna watch a little television. what's the big deal?:::['5-5-136']
jeez, relax, mom.:::['5-5-137']
i said, "jeez, relax, mon.":::['5-5-139']
rachel, i've been wanting to tell you something and i just have to get it out.:::['5-5-141']
okay. all right. what's up?:::['5-5-142']
you know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?:::['5-5-144']
yeah, i told you to give emily whatever she wants.:::['5-5-145']
and while that was good advice, you should know that what she wants...:::['5-5-146']
...is for me not to see you anymore.:::['5-5-148']
well, that's crazy. you can't do that. what are you gonna tell her?:::['5-5-149']
oh, you've already agreed to this, haven't you?:::['5-5-151']
it's awful, i know. uh, it's... heh.:::['5-5-152']
i mean, i feel terrible, but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work.:::['5-5-153']
and i do. i have to make this marriage work. i have to.:::['5-5-154']
but the good thing is, we can still see each other until she gets here.:::['5-5-155']
oh, lucky me! oh, my god! that is good news, ross!:::['5-5-157']
i think that's the best news i've heard since lapooh died!:::['5-5-158']
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been. uh, this is so hard.:::['5-5-159']
oh, yeah, really? is it, ross?:::['5-5-160']
well, let me make this a little easier for you. what are you doing?:::['5-5-161']
storming out. rachel, this is your apartment.:::['5-5-162']
yeah? well, that's how mad i am!:::['5-5-163']
damn rolos!:::['5-5-164']
hey, you're back. hey.:::['5-5-165']
how was your conference?:::['5-5-166']
it was terrible. i fought with my colleagues for the entire time.:::['5-5-167']
are you kidding with this?:::['5-5-168']
uh, so your weekend was a bust?:::['5-5-169']
uh, no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.:::['5-5-170']
hi. hey, you're back too.:::['5-5-171']
yeah. um, chandler, could i talk to you outside for a second?:::['5-5-172']
how was your chef thing? ugh. it was awful.:::['5-5-173']
i guess some people don't appreciate really good food.:::['5-5-174']
maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first......but then made everybody vomit:::['5-5-175']
and have diarrhea.:::['5-5-176']
chandler. monica.:::['5-5-177']
i wanna know how much the room was. i'll pay my half.:::['5-5-178']
okay, fine. $300.:::['5-5-179']
three hundred dollars? yeah. just think of it as $25 per room.:::['5-5-180']
what are you guys woofing about?:::['5-5-181']
chandler stole a 20 from my purse!:::['5-5-182']
you know what? now that i think about it......i constantly find myself:::['5-5-184']
without 20s, and you......always have lots.:::['5-5-185']
you should've seen the look on her face.:::['5-5-186']
i don't want rachel to hate me. i don't know what to do.:::['5-5-187']
you want my advice? yes. please.:::['5-5-188']
you're not gonna like it. that's okay.:::['5-5-189']
you got married too fast.:::['5-5-190']
that's not advice. i told you.:::['5-5-191']
i'm going to the bathroom.:::['5-5-192']
man, if anyone asked me to give up any of you, i don't think i could do it.:::['5-5-193']
maybe i could do it.:::['5-5-195']
i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross.:::['5-5-197']
but i've been obsessing about it all day and would love not to talk about it.:::['5-5-198']
uh, i don't know if this falls under that category......but, uh, ross is right back there.:::['5-5-199']
that's not ross. oh, no, not that guy.:::['5-5-200']
he does look like him, though.:::['5-5-201']
okay. ross is in the bathroom.:::['5-5-202']
oh, my god. it's happening. it's already started. i'm kip.:::['5-5-203']
what? yeah, you're not kip.:::['5-5-204']
do you even know who kip is?:::['5-5-205']
who cares? you're rachel.:::['5-5-206']
who's kip?:::['5-5-207']
kip, my old roommate. we all hung out together.:::['5-5-208']
oh, that poor bastard. mm-hm.:::['5-5-209']
see? you told me the story. he and monica dated.:::['5-5-210']
they broke up, they couldn't be in the same room.:::['5-5-211']
you all promised you'd stay his friend.:::['5-5-212']
and what happened? he got phased out.:::['5-5-213']
you're not gonna be phased out. well, of course i am.:::['5-5-214']
it won't happen to ross. he's your brother, your old college roommate.:::['5-5-215']
it was a matter of time before someone had to leave the group.:::['5-5-216']
i always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.:::['5-5-217']
honey, come on, you live far away, you're not related.:::['5-5-218']
you lift right out.:::['5-5-219']
hey, mr. bing.:::['5-5-221']
that, uh, hotel you stayed at called.:::['5-5-222']
said someone left an eyelash curler in your room.:::['5-5-223']
yes, that was mine.:::['5-5-224']
i figured you hooked up with some girl and she left it.:::['5-5-225']
yes, that would have made more sense.:::['5-5-226']
you know, i don't even feel like i know you anymore, man.:::['5-5-227']
all right, uh, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time, all right?:::['5-5-228']
and whatever you say, i'll believe you.:::['5-5-229']
were you or were you not......on a gay cruise?:::['5-5-230']
i'm sorry about the whole lifting-out thing.:::['5-5-232']
you gotta come with me.:::['5-5-233']
come where? wherever i go.:::['5-5-234']
come on, you and me, we'll start a new group. we're the best ones.:::['5-5-235']
okay, but try to get joey too.:::['5-5-236']
pheebs, do you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec?:::['5-5-237']
oh, sure, yeah.:::['5-5-238']
bye, ross.:::['5-5-239']
forever.:::['5-5-240', '3-16-321']
rachel: ahem. hi.:::['5-5-241']
what are you doing here? isn't this against the rules?:::['5-5-243']
i talked to monica.:::['5-5-244']
look, i'm the one who made the choice.:::['5-5-245']
i'm the one who's making things change.:::['5-5-246']
so i should be the one to, you know, step back.:::['5-5-247']
oh, ross... no, no, it's okay. really.:::['5-5-248']
plenty of people just see their sisters at thanksgiving......and just see their college roommates:::['5-5-249']
at reunions......and just see joey at burger king.:::['5-5-250']
no, it's not better.:::['5-5-252']
i still don't get to see you.:::['5-5-253']
well, what would you do, rach? if you were me, what would you do?:::['5-5-254']
well......for starters, i would have said:::['5-5-255']
the right name at my wedding.:::['5-5-256']
ahem. hey, rach?:::['5-5-261']
sorry to interrupt, but, uh, phoebe said you wanted to talk to me about a trip.:::['5-5-262']
i just came over to drop off......nothing.:::['5-5-264']
so that weekend kind of sucked, huh?:::['5-5-265']
yeah, it did.:::['5-5-266']
so i guess this is over?:::['5-5-267']
what? well, you know, you and me.:::['5-5-268']
i mean, it had to end sometime.:::['5-5-269']
why exactly?:::['5-5-270']
because of the weekend. we had a fight.:::['5-5-271']
chandler, that's crazy.:::['5-5-272']
ha, ha. if you give up every time you have a fight with someone......you'd never be with anyone:::['5-5-273']
longer than...:::['5-5-274']
so this isn't over?:::['5-5-276']
you are so cute!:::['5-5-277']
no, no. it was a fight.:::['5-5-278']
you deal with it and you move on. it's nothing to freak out about.:::['5-5-279']
really? okay, great. heh.:::['5-5-280']
aw. welcome to an adult relationship.:::['5-5-281']
we're in a relationship?:::['5-5-282']
i'm afraid so. okay.:::['5-5-283']
oh, hey, monica, i heard you saw donald trump at your convention.:::['5-5-285']
yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.:::['5-5-286']
rach, can i borrow your eyelash curler? i lost mine.:::['5-5-287']
yeah, it's in the bathroom.:::['5-5-288']
joey, can i talk to you for a second? ooh, oh!:::['5-5-290']
joey, i need to talk to you. oh! oh!:::['5-5-291']
yes, but you cannot tell anyone. no one knows.:::['5-5-295']
but how? when?:::['5-5-296']
it happened in london. in london!:::['5-5-297']
the reason we didn't tell anyone was we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.:::['5-5-298']
but it is a big deal! i have to tell someone!:::['5-5-299']
no, no, no. you can't.:::['5-5-300']
please, please. we just don't wanna deal with telling everyone.:::['5-5-301']
please, just promise you won't tell.:::['5-5-302']
man, this is unbelievable!:::['5-5-304']
i mean, it's great! but...:::['5-5-305']
i know. it's great! ha, ha. ha, ha.:::['5-5-306']
oh, i don't wanna see that!:::['5-5-307']
we're so stupid.:::['5-5-308']
do you know what's going on in there? they're trying to take joey.:::['5-5-309']
"the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe. heh.:::['5-5-310']
if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, 'hi, phoebe!"':::['5-5-311']
oh, that's cute. we really all enjoyed it.:::['5-5-312']
but you know it doesn't count. for what?:::['5-5-313']
just count in our heads as good mad libs.:::['5-5-314']
chandler: i guess fun time's over. joey: yeah, i'm done.:::['5-5-315']
wait, guys, if we follow the rules......it's still fun and it means something.:::['5-5-316']
chandler: i'm gonna take off.:::['5-5-317']
guys, rules are good!:::['5-5-318']
rules help control the fun.:::['5-5-319']
are you looking at naked tribeswomen?:::['5-7-0']
no, look.:::['5-7-1']
that's a pig.:::['5-7-2']
i know. but look at the knobs on it!:::['5-7-3']
chandler: hey. joey: hey.:::['5-7-4']
emily's cousin kicked me out.:::['5-7-5']
when you sublet from your wife's cousin......then you divorce, sometimes:::['5-7-7']
the cousin wants his apartment back.:::['5-7-8']
didn't you sign a lease?:::['5-7-9']
who needs a lease when it's "family"?:::['5-7-10']
you can stay with us.:::['5-7-11']
chandler: anything you need.:::['5-7-12']
but you have to let us know when you feel better......so we can make fun of your hair.:::['5-7-13']
you got it. joey: okay.:::['5-7-14']
thanks, i really appreciate this. i'm going to get packing again.:::['5-7-15']
i've been moving around so much that i feel like a nomad.:::['5-7-16']
what? he thought you said gonad.:::['5-7-17']
wow, monica. if every place were this clean, it'd be tough making a living.:::['5-7-18']
ha, oh, larry!:::['5-7-19']
um, do health inspectors work on commission?:::['5-7-20']
no, bribes.:::['5-7-21']
ha-ha-ha, it's okay to laugh? i was just kidding.:::['5-7-22']
i'll check the kitchen floor. monica: knock yourself out.:::['5-7-23']
yummy! heh.:::['5-7-24']
larry?:::['5-7-25']
yeah, i'd let him check out my kitchen floor.:::['5-7-26']
a 98.:::['5-7-27']
i deducted two points for not wearing your hat.:::['5-7-28']
that is a section 5 violation.:::['5-7-29']
oh. now look, larry, honey, ha, ha.:::['5-7-30']
um, i wrote the book on section 5.:::['5-7-31']
you only need to wear it in the kitchen.:::['5-7-32']
where's your hat? in the kitchen. i'll get it.:::['5-7-33']
ah, there's the two points!:::['5-7-34']
you should really read that book you wrote.:::['5-7-35']
you saw the hat in the kitchen and knew she'd go in hatless to get it, heh.:::['5-7-37']
you could have your own health inspector detective show.:::['5-7-38']
ah, i don't know about that.:::['5-7-39']
but then i could be your sidekick, voonda, heh.:::['5-7-40']
maybe, uh, i could ask voonda to dinner sometime?:::['5-7-41']
she would love that......since you know:::['5-7-42']
all the clean places to eat, heh.:::['5-7-43']
i'll call you.:::['5-7-44']
he's so funny! whoa, oh.:::['5-7-46']
how's ross doing since all the emily stuff?:::['5-7-48']
he's not great. but, um, he's dealing with it.:::['5-7-49']
oh. wait, you're not...:::['5-7-50']
oh, i can't get started with all that ross stuff again.:::['5-7-51']
he'll be screwed up for a long time.:::['5-7-52']
besides, i don't go for guys right after they get divorced.:::['5-7-53']
right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.:::['5-7-54']
danny: two pounds of mocha java. monica: it's danny.:::['5-7-55']
are you going to go out again?:::['5-7-56']
i don't know. he hasn't called since we went out.:::['5-7-57']
i see him in the hallway. we flirt. i'm all......and then nothing.:::['5-7-58']
hey. rachel: hi, danny.:::['5-7-59']
wow, thirsty, huh?:::['5-7-60']
i'm having a party on saturday. sort of a housewarming thing.:::['5-7-61']
oh, fun. oh, great!:::['5-7-62']
really looking forward to it. rachel: yeah.:::['5-7-63']
see you!:::['5-7-64']
so i guess we won't be warming his house.:::['5-7-65']
oh, ha, ha, okay.:::['5-7-66']
all right, i see what he's doing.:::['5-7-67']
he's not asking me out because he wants me to ask him out.:::['5-7-68']
and you won't do that.:::['5-7-69']
that's right!:::['5-7-70', '4-24-274']
because that would give him the control.:::['5-7-71']
so now he comes up with this "i've got a party" thing......to get me to hint:::['5-7-72']
for an invitation.:::['5-7-73']
blew up in his face, didn't it? ha.:::['5-7-74']
so there is no party?:::['5-7-75']
no, there's a party. there's a party.:::['5-7-76']
but the power?:::['5-7-77']
that is still up for grabs.:::['5-7-78']
you follow me?:::['5-7-79']
so he won't invite you to his party because he likes you?:::['5-7-81']
hey, roomies!:::['5-7-84']
i love what you've done with the place.:::['5-7-85']
oh, i know it's a lot of boxes.:::['5-7-86']
i appreciate you letting me stay here. joey: not a problem.:::['5-7-87']
since you'll be here a while......we, uh, could put your name:::['5-7-88']
on the answering machine.:::['5-7-89']
oh, i, uh, hope you don't mind......but i kind of already:::['5-7-90']
jazzed it up a little, ha, ha.:::['5-7-91']
playing on answering machine]:::['5-7-93']
we will call you back:::['5-7-94']
pretty cool, huh? chandler: oh, yes.:::['5-7-95']
you're fake laughing too, right? the tears are real.:::['5-7-96']
you look beautiful this evening. heh.:::['5-7-98']
show me the badge again.:::['5-7-99']
shiny, ha, ha.:::['5-7-100']
oh, you mind if i wash up? who knows where these have been?:::['5-7-101']
you are just nonstop, ha-ha-ha!:::['5-7-102']
we're out of here. why?:::['5-7-103']
i saw ten violations. i'm shutting this place down!:::['5-7-104']
you have the power to do that? this does.:::['5-7-105']
shut it down.:::['5-7-106']
you built a fort, didn't you?:::['5-7-110']
kind of, heh.:::['5-7-111']
oh, my god! the air purifier. ross' air purifier.:::['5-7-112']
all i heard for four years through college was...:::['5-7-113']
you should have gone out once in a while.:::['5-7-114']
i hate this thing! come on, chandler.:::['5-7-115']
ross is our friend. he needs us right now.:::['5-7-116']
so why don't you be a grownup and come watch tv in the fort?:::['5-7-117']
oh, hi, danny. hey, guys.:::['5-7-118']
uh, i wanted to invite you to the party.:::['5-7-119']
oh, thanks, i'll try to stop by.:::['5-7-120']
actually, i think, ahem, i'm going to be busy.:::['5-7-121']
remember? i've got that, uh, gala.:::['5-7-124']
what's the gala for?:::['5-7-125']
uh, it's a, um...:::['5-7-126']
it's, uh, a regatta gala.:::['5-7-127']
do you sail?:::['5-7-128']
no, but i support it.:::['5-7-129']
i hope i see you tomorrow night. take care.:::['5-7-130']
walked right into that one, didn't he?:::['5-7-132']
you wanted him to invite you and he did.:::['5-7-134']
he waited until the last minute. so if i said yes......he'd know i had nothing better:::['5-7-135']
to do than wait for his invitation.:::['5-7-136']
but i said no......which puts me back:::['5-7-137']
in the driver's seat.:::['5-7-138']
so the ball is in his court?:::['5-7-139']
ball?:::['5-7-140']
no, there's no ball.:::['5-7-141']
joey, please.:::['5-7-142']
hello, children. joey: hey.:::['5-7-144']
you want to play some foosball? please?:::['5-7-145']
okay. no, no, no.:::['5-7-146']
we moved the table into my room because of all the boxes, ha, ha.:::['5-7-147']
i have one question.:::['5-7-149']
what is the deal with this?:::['5-7-150']
bye-bye, little puppet joey hand?:::['5-7-151']
no, the quiet down thing.:::['5-7-152']
oh. you mean this.:::['5-7-153']
i don't know how much more i can take.:::['5-7-155']
did you know he taped over my baywatch tape with a show about bugs?:::['5-7-156']
what if that had been porn? oh!:::['5-7-158']
all right, this may be tough......but it's ross.:::['5-7-159']
i survived college with him.:::['5-7-160']
i guess i can hold out a little longer.:::['5-7-161']
let's have a game. okay.:::['5-7-162']
don't be scored on. no, no, no.:::['5-7-163']
yes. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-7-164']
uh, fellas?:::['5-7-165']
so he's out of here. mm-hm.:::['5-7-166']
got anything to eat? i went to jono's and it was closed.:::['5-7-168']
oh, i took larry there, but it was all violated, so we shut it down.:::['5-7-169']
if this guy keeps closing our favorite places, where will we eat?:::['5-7-170']
i don't know. clean places?:::['5-7-171']
mm, yum!:::['5-7-172']
it's danny.:::['5-7-173']
don't let him in! i'm supposed to be at a gala.:::['5-7-174']
we'll be right there. can't you say it's later?:::['5-7-175']
what kind of a regatta gala starts at night?:::['5-7-176']
the fake kind.:::['5-7-177']
um, i need a ladle. you got a ladle? we have a ladle.:::['5-7-178']
see you at the party.:::['5-7-179']
you know what larry would say? he'd say, "see you ladle.":::['5-7-181']
i'm done. you want anything? uh, sports? international?:::['5-7-182']
apartment listings?:::['5-7-183']
i'll take sports.:::['5-7-184']
mine!:::['5-7-185', '5-2-256']
all right, uh, international.:::['5-7-186']
that's mine too.:::['5-7-187']
i'm italian.:::['5-7-188']
i could check apartment listings, though there's never anything here.:::['5-7-189']
not even on page seven?:::['5-7-190']
you're right. oh, here's an affordable place.:::['5-7-192']
two bedroom, close to work. ooh, it's available in five weeks.:::['5-7-193']
what about that circled one?:::['5-7-194']
ooh, i don't know. it's kind of expensive for a studio.:::['5-7-195']
but it's available now.:::['5-7-196']
let's go look at it, heh!:::['5-7-199']
oh, okay. let's go. chandler: there we go! yay!:::['5-7-200']
oh, oh, oh, guys, would you, uh, chip in for some new air filters for the purifier?:::['5-7-201']
i mean, after all, we are all using it.:::['5-7-202']
let's go quicker!:::['5-7-203']
oh, my god! mm.:::['5-7-205']
oh, look at this kitchen/bathroom.:::['5-7-206']
that's great! so you can cook while in the tub.:::['5-7-207']
somebody was using his head.:::['5-7-208']
let's check out the rest of the place.:::['5-7-209']
i think this is it.:::['5-7-210']
i don't know. maybe we should keep looking.:::['5-7-211']
but this place is available now.:::['5-7-212']
you don't want to be stuck with us for five weeks.:::['5-7-213']
so you think i should take this place?:::['5-7-214']
oh, it's perfect!:::['5-7-215']
kitchen, slash, bathroom.:::['5-7-217']
ah, i see what you guys are saying.:::['5-7-218']
i'll, uh, go downstairs and fill out an application.:::['5-7-219']
we are bad people.:::['5-7-220']
he knew we were trying to get rid of him.:::['5-7-221']
could we get a bathtub in our kitchen?:::['5-7-222']
ready for dinner?:::['5-7-223']
ooh, absolutely. great.:::['5-7-224']
you wanted to go to the italian place on bleecker st?:::['5-7-225']
oh, i love that place, ha, ha.:::['5-7-226']
so no. oh.:::['5-7-227']
how about mama lozetti's?:::['5-7-228']
how long has that milk been sitting out?:::['5-7-231']
no, this place is totally healthy.:::['5-7-232']
this milk is mine. i bought this today......because i was thirsty for milk,you know?:::['5-7-233']
okay, let's go.:::['5-7-234']
health code 11 b requires that refuse be taken out the back exit.:::['5-7-236']
but then i have to go all the way around.:::['5-7-237']
so you choose convenience over health?:::['5-7-238']
stop, larry.:::['5-7-239']
can't you just be larry and not larry the health inspector guy?:::['5-7-240']
it was exciting at first.:::['5-7-241']
but now, it's like, so where are we going to eat ever?:::['5-7-242']
i suppose i could give him a warning.:::['5-7-243']
go, go!:::['5-7-245']
if, after dinner, you still need to bust someone......i know a hot dog vendor:::['5-7-246']
who picks his nose.:::['5-7-247']
maybe we did good, helping ross get back on his feet.:::['5-7-248']
that was a nice place.:::['5-7-249']
no closet space, but he could hang his stuff out the window in a bag.:::['5-7-250']
maybe pizza?:::['5-7-253']
about ross! oh.:::['5-7-254']
it's the apartment manager. ross put us as references.:::['5-7-257']
ross is the greatest guy. he's very reliable...:::['5-7-258']
of course, he has a big, huge dog that, uh, barks into the night.:::['5-7-259']
well, who doesn't love dogs?:::['5-7-260']
uh, he's a tap dancer.:::['5-7-261']
yes, some would say that is a lost art.:::['5-7-262']
he's a pimp!:::['5-7-263']
there you go. he's a pimp.:::['5-7-264']
he's a big, tap-dancing pimp!:::['5-7-265']
watching for a sound to lead me to wherever...:::['5-7-269']
shh, this is never going to work. he's right there.:::['5-7-270']
just go say hi.:::['5-7-271']
i have to go downstairs and back up, as if i'm coming home from the gala.:::['5-7-272']
so just go distract him. but don't be sexy.:::['5-7-273']
hey, danny. hey.:::['5-7-274']
this is a great party. great food, ha, ha.:::['5-7-276']
oh, you know, most parties, it's, uh, all chips and salsa, chips and salsa.:::['5-7-277']
salad.:::['5-7-280']
and what's this?:::['5-7-282']
bread.:::['5-7-283']
aren't you a chef?:::['5-7-284']
hey, rachel. hey.:::['5-7-286']
oh, right, tonight was your party.:::['5-7-287']
you look great! i'm glad you made it.:::['5-7-288']
oh, well, you know, the gala had to end sometime.:::['5-7-289']
don't go anywhere. i'll be right back.:::['5-7-290']
yeah, sure. all right?:::['5-7-291']
whose court is the ball in now?:::['5-7-292']
i thought there wasn't a ball.:::['5-7-293']
come on. he's glad i came. he doesn't want me to go anywhere.:::['5-7-294']
ball's flying all over the place.:::['5-7-295']
this is my friend, tom.:::['5-7-296']
this is the girl i told you about.:::['5-7-297']
oh, come on! you telling people about me?:::['5-7-298']
i think you two could really hit it off.:::['5-7-299']
i'm gonna go mingle.:::['5-7-300']
so you work at bloomingdale's, huh? my mom calls it "bloomies.":::['5-7-301']
at ease, soldier, heh.:::['5-7-303']
you can just drop the act. i know what's going on.:::['5-7-305']
you're danny's wingman, right?:::['5-7-306']
you guys are best buds, frat bros.:::['5-7-307']
i'm going to go talk to, uh, a friend.:::['5-7-308']
yeah, you go talk to your friend.:::['5-7-309']
go tell him, "nice try.":::['5-7-310']
he just keeps lobbing them up......and i keep knocking them:::['5-7-311']
right out of the park.:::['5-7-312']
i think i need a drink.:::['5-7-313']
ninety-eight......ninety-nine......one hundred!:::['5-7-315']
okay. go.:::['5-7-316']
dude, i'm telling you, i'm fine.:::['5-7-317']
here we go, here we go.:::['5-7-318']
joey & chandler: hey. hey.:::['5-7-319']
so i, uh, didn't get that apartment. some problem with my application.:::['5-7-320']
you're kidding?:::['5-7-321']
but phoebe said i could stay at her place for a while, so...:::['5-7-322']
well, you can't stay with phoebe. we're roomies.:::['5-7-323']
you don't need me taking up all your space.:::['5-7-324']
we got plenty of space. there's still some by that speaker.:::['5-7-325']
please, just stay.:::['5-7-326']
definitely. you have to stay.:::['5-7-329']
all right. all right, buddy.:::['5-7-330']
so i'm a pimp, huh?:::['5-7-331']
sometimes i can be a pain in the ass.:::['5-7-333']
but just talk to me. tell me if something bothers you.:::['5-7-334']
and i'll do everything i can to keep my annoying habits just...:::['5-7-335']
the cowboy hat's a little much.:::['5-7-337']
come on, it's fun!:::['5-7-338']
dude, stop talking crazy, and make us some tea!:::['5-7-341']
hey, hey, hey, hey.:::['5-6-0']
none of that. not while you're living under my roof.:::['5-6-1']
look, just because i know about you two doesn't mean i like looking at it.:::['5-6-3']
aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?:::['5-6-4']
well, i'm sorry if i'm not a middle-aged black woman.:::['5-6-5']
and i'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition.:::['5-6-6']
okay, look, if i have to pretend i don't know about you two......then you two are gonna have to pretend:::['5-6-7']
there's nothing to know about.:::['5-6-8']
both: okay, sorry.:::['5-6-9']
joey: i can hear that.:::['5-6-10']
rachel's at work.:::['5-6-11']
joey: i can still hear you.:::['5-6-12']
monica: hey. what's that?:::['5-6-14']
yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother.:::['5-6-15']
a year ago i didn't even have a family......and now i have heirlooms:::['5-6-17']
for crying out loud.:::['5-6-18']
oh, god! joey: aah!:::['5-6-19']
oh, soft.:::['5-6-20']
is this mink? phoebe: yeah.:::['5-6-21']
why would my mother send me a fur? doesn't she know me but at all?:::['5-6-22']
plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.:::['5-6-23']
yeah, just some 9-year-old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody......for 12 cents an hour.:::['5-6-24']
that didn't happen, i made that up.:::['5-6-25']
hey. gunther: ross?:::['5-6-26']
ross, you can't put up flyers in here.:::['5-6-27']
how come? everybody else does.:::['5-6-28']
you can't.:::['5-6-29']
monica: what is that?:::['5-6-30']
oh, uh, i'm getting rid of a couple of things.:::['5-6-31']
this is all of your things.:::['5-6-32']
yes, yes, it is.:::['5-6-33']
no, but it's good. emily thinks we should get all new stuff.:::['5-6-34']
stuff that's just ours. together, you know, brand new.:::['5-6-35']
so basically this is a "getting rid of anything rachel ever touched" sale.:::['5-6-36']
touched, used, sat on, slept on...:::['5-6-37']
i'll take it all.:::['5-6-38']
hey, ross, you're okay with that?:::['5-6-39']
look, if i can just do what emily wants......and get her to new york,i'm sure everything will be fine.:::['5-6-40']
okay, but don't you think that's a little extreme?:::['5-6-41']
after what i did, can you blame her? oh, my god. you got off easy.:::['5-6-42']
when my friend sylvie's husband said someone else's name in bed......she cursed him:::['5-6-43']
and turned his thingy green.:::['5-6-44']
what is he doing?:::['5-6-45']
emily thinks ross' furniture has got rachel cooties?:::['5-6-46']
calm down, joey. joey: no.:::['5-6-47']
everything's getting all messed up, you know?:::['5-6-48']
emily won't let ross see rachel.:::['5-6-49']
we're not gonna stop seeing rachel, hence, ross stops seeing us.:::['5-6-50']
oh, i hate this. everything's changing.:::['5-6-51']
yeah, i know. we're losing ross, joey said "hence.":::['5-6-52']
i'm not happy about this either, but, you know, if ross says he's happy......then we just have to keep our feelings:::['5-6-53']
about emily to ourselves.:::['5-6-54']
are you cool with that?:::['5-6-55']
but, you know, i'm an actor.:::['5-6-57']
i'll act cool.:::['5-6-58']
ooh. oh, god, storage rooms give me the creeps.:::['5-6-59']
monica, please, hurry up, honey, please.:::['5-6-60']
if you want the little round waffles......you've gotta wait till i find:::['5-6-61']
the little round waffle iron.:::['5-6-62']
i want the little round waffles. all right.:::['5-6-63']
here it is.:::['5-6-64']
right underneath the can of bug bomb.:::['5-6-65']
i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the poison?:::['5-6-66']
okay, you know what? i'll have toast.:::['5-6-67']
fog him! fog him!:::['5-6-68']
i don't know what i'm gonna do about this coat.:::['5-6-69']
that might work. oh, yeah, ha, ha.:::['5-6-71']
huh? all right, what do you think?:::['5-6-72']
you're on in five, ms. minnelli.:::['5-6-73']
no, no, no, it's just a bit sudden.:::['5-6-74']
no, it's great, okay? i am totally on board.:::['5-6-75']
i love you too. all right, bye.:::['5-6-76']
what's the matter, ross? nothing. no. oh, uh, actually......great news. heh.:::['5-6-77']
um, just got off the phone with emily......and looks like i'm moving:::['5-6-78']
to a new apartment.:::['5-6-79']
whoo-hoo!:::['5-6-80']
why? well, her thought is... and i agree.:::['5-6-81']
fresh new furniture, why not a fresh new apartment?:::['5-6-82']
her cousin has this great place to sublet.:::['5-6-83']
it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other.:::['5-6-84']
that's way uptown. that's like three trains away......which is great.:::['5-6-85']
i love to ride that rail.:::['5-6-86']
so you're really okay with this?:::['5-6-87']
yes, yes. i mean, it's kind of far from work......but, uh, you know,i'll get so much done on the commute.:::['5-6-88']
i've been given the gift of time.:::['5-6-89']
that's so funny, because last christmas i got the gift of space.:::['5-6-90']
we should get them together and make a continuum.:::['5-6-91']
now he's moving?:::['5-6-92']
man, what is emily doing to him? ow!:::['5-6-93']
he's not even here.:::['5-6-94']
you guys. you guys.:::['5-6-95']
we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man.:::['5-6-96']
he was like this crazy-eyed, hairy beast-man.:::['5-6-97']
he was like a bigfoot or a yeti or something.:::['5-6-98']
he came at us with an ax, so rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.:::['5-6-99']
yeah, i pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass.:::['5-6-100']
uh, like, dark hair, bushy beard?:::['5-6-101']
yeah. yeah, you fogged danny.:::['5-6-102']
ugh, please. we did not fog danny.:::['5-6-103']
who's danny?:::['5-6-104']
danny just moved in downstairs.:::['5-6-105']
he just got back from this four-month trek in the andes. nice fella.:::['5-6-106']
oh, he's nice. he's nice. you know, you always......stick up for the people we fog.:::['5-6-107']
yeah? rachel: hi.:::['5-6-108']
you might not remember us, but we are the girls that fogged you.:::['5-6-109']
we're really sorry we fogged you. yeah.:::['5-6-110']
hi, uh, just so you know, we didn't mean to fog you.:::['5-6-112']
we actually thought you were like a yeti or something.:::['5-6-113']
hi. ahem, sorry to bother you......but i don't think that we can accept:::['5-6-116']
your acceptance of our apology.:::['5-6-117']
it just doesn't really seem like you mean it.:::['5-6-118']
wow. that guy is so rude.:::['5-6-120']
really. what is with that guy?:::['5-6-121']
i mean, you'd forgive me if i fogged you.:::['5-6-122']
well, you did, a little bit.:::['5-6-123']
oh, my god, honey. i'm so sorry.:::['5-6-124']
i totally forgive you. really?:::['5-6-125']
so listen, you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium?:::['5-6-127']
crematorium chris? sure.:::['5-6-128']
well, he said that he would cremate my fur coat for free......if i, um, you know, bring in:::['5-6-129']
the next person i know who dies.:::['5-6-130']
oh, my god. look at these pelts.:::['5-6-132']
don't get too attached. she's having it cremated.:::['5-6-133']
rachel: wha...?:::['5-6-134']
phoebe? ha. honey?:::['5-6-135']
honey, i know you're quirky, and i get a big kick out of it. we all do, actually.:::['5-6-136']
but if you destroy a coat like this......i mean, that is like a crime:::['5-6-137']
against nature.:::['5-6-138']
not nature. fashion.:::['5-6-139']
this is fashion?:::['5-6-140']
okay, so to you, death is fashion?:::['5-6-141']
that's really funny. yeah, here's phoebe, uh......sporting, you know,cutting-edge hairy carcass......from, you know,the steel traps of wintry russia.:::['5-6-142']
i mean, you really think this looks good?:::['5-6-143']
because i do.:::['5-6-144']
i know, i miss you too. i can't wait to see you.:::['5-6-145']
i love you. bye.:::['5-6-146']
okay, what is in here, rocks?:::['5-6-147']
no, this is my collection of, uh, fossil samples.:::['5-6-148']
so rocks.:::['5-6-149']
i'm really gonna miss this apartment. heh.:::['5-6-150']
you know, ben took his first steps right over there.:::['5-6-151']
hey, remember when i ran into this thing and it kind of knocked me out a little?:::['5-6-152']
i love this place.:::['5-6-153']
to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move.:::['5-6-154']
uh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?:::['5-6-155']
well, i mean, if, uh, emily gave me a choice...:::['5-6-156']
you do have a choice.:::['5-6-157']
ross, why are you listening to her? are you crazy?:::['5-6-158']
it's not right what emily wants you to do. she is totally... ow!:::['5-6-160']
stop pinching me.:::['5-6-161']
you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy, right?:::['5-6-162']
well, he just told me that he's not entirely happy.:::['5-6-163']
we all hate emily.:::['5-6-165']
no. no, ross, we do not hate emily.:::['5-6-166']
we just think that you're having to sacrifice......a whole lot to make her happy.:::['5-6-167']
we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.:::['5-6-169']
yes, yes, unreasonable.:::['5-6-170']
unreasonable?:::['5-6-171']
how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married?:::['5-6-172']
you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.:::['5-6-173']
it's about compromise. do you always like it? no.:::['5-6-174']
do you do it? yes.:::['5-6-175']
because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky......drinking coffee at central perk:::['5-6-176']
all the time. it's real life, okay?:::['5-6-177']
it's what grownups do.:::['5-6-178']
i think he's right.:::['5-6-179']
you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.:::['5-6-180']
god, i feel so guilty about ross. phoebe: ugh, i know.:::['5-6-181']
i kind of feel like it's my fault.:::['5-6-182']
kind of?:::['5-6-183']
if you just kept this to yourself, none of this would have happened.:::['5-6-184']
well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days......something was bound to slip out.:::['5-6-185']
well, i think it's very brave what you said.:::['5-6-186']
i can't sit here anymore. i have to walk places.:::['5-6-187']
pheebs, what are you doing with the coat? how about the whole animal rights thing?:::['5-6-188']
well, ahem, i've been reading up, and for your information......minks are not very nice.:::['5-6-189']
okay, i admit it. i love this coat, okay?:::['5-6-190']
it's the best thing i've ever had wrapped around me, including phil huntley.:::['5-6-191']
remember phil huntley? he was fine.:::['5-6-192']
so you like the short hair better? rachel: what?:::['5-6-194']
yeti? uh, danny?:::['5-6-195']
i had to cut my hair to get rid of the, uh......fogger smell.:::['5-6-196']
listen, i'm so sorry. i would have never fogged you......you know, if you hadn't looked so...:::['5-6-198']
you know, um...:::['5-6-199']
absolutely. some people are just into appearances.:::['5-6-200']
what? that's cool. that's cool.:::['5-6-201']
what...? hey, whoa, no, no, no, that is not cool.:::['5-6-202']
you don't even know me.:::['5-6-203']
come on. you got the shopping bags and the saks catalogue.:::['5-6-204']
so from that, you think you've got me all figured out?:::['5-6-205']
well, you don't.:::['5-6-206']
you know, i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here.:::['5-6-207']
well, you know, if kids like to play with capri pants.:::['5-6-209']
and stop saying that. i hate that.:::['5-6-211']
danny: okay.:::['5-6-212']
fine. i judged you. i made a snap judgment.:::['5-6-213']
but you did it too, and you're worse......because you are sticking:::['5-6-214']
to your stupid snap judgment.:::['5-6-215']
you can't even open up your mind for a second to see that you might be wrong.:::['5-6-216']
what does that say about you?:::['5-6-217']
that pizza place across the street any good?:::['5-6-218']
what? i'm hungry.:::['5-6-219']
you wanna get some pizza? you can keep yelling if there's more.:::['5-6-220']
okay. stop saying that. i hate that.:::['5-6-222']
are you still mad at us? ross: yup.:::['5-6-224']
oh, good, because we have an "i'm sorry" song. ha, ha.:::['5-6-225']
you know what? i'm really not in the mood.:::['5-6-226']
look, ross.:::['5-6-227', '4-11-177']
i feel really bad. i mean, you're going through all this stuff......and i just acted like a jerk.:::['5-6-228']
yeah, we are so sorry. you're stepping on the song.:::['5-6-229']
look, we were way out of line, all right? we totally support you.:::['5-6-230']
whatever you decide, whatever you do.:::['5-6-231']
okay, now you're just taking lines right out of the song.:::['5-6-232']
look, this is hard enough, okay? i really need you guys right now.:::['5-6-233']
yes, exactly. and that's why...:::['5-6-234']
why don't you come over tonight, and i'll make you your favorite dinner?:::['5-6-235']
pheebs, are you wearing fur?:::['5-6-239']
okay, let's get some perspective, people.:::['5-6-240']
it's not like i'm wearing a seeing-eye dog coat.:::['5-6-241']
you know, ross, i, uh, think i kind of understand why i lost it today.:::['5-6-242']
you do, huh? yeah, you see, um......i'm an actor, right?:::['5-6-243']
so i gotta keep my emotions right at the surface, you know?:::['5-6-244']
i got a lot of balls in the air, you know what i mean?:::['5-6-245']
it's tough. guys like me, you know, you wander around, you're alone.:::['5-6-246']
hi. hey, look at you. where have you been?:::['5-6-249']
oh, i went to have pizza. with danny.:::['5-6-250']
how did that happen? that yeti is one smooth talker.:::['5-6-251']
i hope you're not too full, because dinner's almost ready.:::['5-6-252']
yeah, you know, i think i'm probably just gonna hang out in my room.:::['5-6-253']
joey: oh, no. chandler: why?:::['5-6-254']
listen, if emily knew i was here having dinner with you, she would flip out......and you know it.:::['5-6-256']
it's okay. i really... i don't mind.:::['5-6-257']
wait, wait, wait. you know what? just stay.:::['5-6-258']
it would really mean a lot for me if you stay.:::['5-6-260']
ross, i just...:::['5-6-261']
rachel, please, just have dinner with us.:::['5-6-262']
okay, joey, it's okay. settle down.:::['5-6-263']
all right. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.:::['5-6-264']
you see, rach, i'm an actor.:::['5-6-265']
hey. hey, look. ugly naked guy's back.:::['5-6-266']
we haven't seen him in so long.:::['5-6-267']
oh, god. i really missed that fat bastard.:::['5-6-268']
wow. this is so weird.:::['5-6-269']
i just realized this may be the last time we're all hanging out together.:::['5-6-270']
it's almost as if he knew.:::['5-6-271']
hi, emily.:::['5-6-274']
yeah, uh, you tracked him down. hold on one second.:::['5-6-275']
yeah, yeah, we're, uh, just having dinner.:::['5-6-277']
uh, yeah, sure, hold on.:::['5-6-278']
she wants to say hi. hold on.:::['5-6-279']
all: hi, emily.:::['5-6-280']
hello, everyone.:::['5-6-281']
so who am i saying hello to?:::['5-6-282']
well, uh, i don't know about who's here......but i can tell you for damn sure:::['5-6-283']
who's not here, and that's rachel.:::['5-6-284']
emily: well, i should hope not. ross knows better than that by now.:::['5-6-285']
you know what? uh, rachel is here.:::['5-6-286']
emily: she's there?:::['5-6-287']
oh, yeah, there she is.:::['5-6-288']
yeah. yeah, she's here.:::['5-6-289']
ross, take me off speakerphone.:::['5-6-290']
hi. how could you do this to me?:::['5-6-291']
i thought i'd made my feelings about rachel perfectly clear.:::['5-6-292']
look, emily, i'm just having dinner with my friends, okay?:::['5-6-293']
you obviously can't keep away from her. that's ridiculous.:::['5-6-294']
look, i'm moving for you. i'm cutting friends out of my life for you.:::['5-6-295']
please, just get on the plane and come to new york, okay?:::['5-6-296']
you'll see you're the only person i want to be with.:::['5-6-297']
i'll feel better when i'm there and i can know where you are all the time.:::['5-6-298']
well, you can't know where i am all the time.:::['5-6-299']
look, this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me.:::['5-6-300']
so... can you trust me?:::['5-6-302']
i think it's going okay.:::['5-6-304']
looks like he's smiling.:::['5-6-305']
how can you tell? you can only see the back of his head.:::['5-6-306']
you can totally tell.:::['5-6-307']
here, look, watch me.:::['5-6-308']
smile. frown. smile. frown. smile.:::['5-6-309']
well, i guess that's it.:::['5-6-310']
all: why? what happened?:::['5-6-311']
my marriage is over.:::['5-6-312']
chandler: what? monica: oh, sweetie.:::['5-6-313']
oh, look at you, you're shivering.:::['5-6-314']
ross, honey, is there anything we can do?:::['5-6-316']
you can help me get my furniture back from gunther.:::['5-6-318']
okay, stop tormenting me.:::['5-6-319']
this is mink, okay? they're mean, and they hate squirrels.:::['5-6-320']
and, you know, most of these probably wanted to be coats.:::['5-6-321']
all right, fine. no, i get it. here.:::['5-6-322']
you take it.:::['5-6-323']
are you happy now? i'm cold.:::['5-6-324']
cheers. cheers.:::['5-2-0']
you look cute in bubbles.:::['5-2-1']
ahh, you're just all liquored up.:::['5-2-2']
joey: hey, it's me. i'm coming in.:::['5-2-3']
want some chicken?:::['5-2-5']
no, thanks. no chicken. bye-bye.:::['5-2-6']
you sure? some extra-crispy, dirty rice?:::['5-2-7']
for the last time, no! get out, joey!:::['5-2-8']
are you okay? he wouldn't leave.:::['5-2-10']
he kept asking me if i wanted chicken.:::['5-2-11']
could i get a, uh, three-piece, some coleslaw, some beans and a coke?:::['5-2-15']
aah! diet coke.:::['5-2-16']
joey: morning, pheebs. phoebe: i have to tell you this story.:::['5-2-18']
i was coming over and this cabdriver...:::['5-2-19']
was his name angus?:::['5-2-20']
he was a cabdriver we had in london.:::['5-2-22']
oh. ha, ha, ha.:::['5-2-23']
all right. anyway...:::['5-2-24']
what was that pub he took us to?:::['5-2-25']
the wheat sheaf!:::['5-2-26']
and they had that beer...:::['5-2-27']
boddington's. boddington's.:::['5-2-28']
ooh, uh, pheebs was going to tell a story.:::['5-2-29']
so he had a really funny hat.:::['5-2-30']
hey. hey, ross!:::['5-2-32']
boddington's!:::['5-2-33']
i'd walk back to london for another frosty one of those bad boys.:::['5-2-35']
they have them at the british pub by the trade center.:::['5-2-36']
later!:::['5-2-37']
shouldn't rachel be back?:::['5-2-38']
her plane got delayed.:::['5-2-39']
but she should be here by now.:::['5-2-40']
so you talked to her? did she sound mad?:::['5-2-41']
no. but she likes me.:::['5-2-42']
you abandoned her on a plane to greece.:::['5-2-43']
i did not "abandon" rachel. okay?:::['5-2-44']
emily showed up at the airport.:::['5-2-45']
i had to go after her. i did what i had to do.:::['5-2-46']
she's my wife. rachel is my wife.:::['5-2-47']
emily!:::['5-2-48', '5-1-335', '4-24-327']
emily is my wife.:::['5-2-49']
man, what is that?:::['5-2-50']
you haven't heard from emily?:::['5-2-51']
not since i lost her at the airport.:::['5-2-52']
i can't believe she can outrun you.:::['5-2-53']
hey! she's fast, okay?:::['5-2-54']
you think you can beat me? let's go! outside!:::['5-2-55']
all: hi! rachel!:::['5-2-57']
rach, i am so sorry. i am so, so sorry.:::['5-2-58']
come on. you just did what you had to do.:::['5-2-59']
that's it? you're not mad? it must've been terrible.:::['5-2-61']
terrible? hell, i was in greece!:::['5-2-62']
there was a nice hotel, nice beach, met the nice people.:::['5-2-63']
it's not too shabby for rachel.:::['5-2-64']
so, what, that's it?:::['5-2-65']
well, yeah. we're cool. totally cool.:::['5-2-66']
thanks, rach. you're the best.:::['5-2-67']
oh, no. you're the best.:::['5-2-68']
oh, i got to go to the flower store.:::['5-2-69']
no one will tell me where emily is......so i'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red:::['5-2-70']
roses to her parents' house.:::['5-2-71']
one for each day i've known and loved her.:::['5-2-72']
that should get her talking.:::['5-2-73']
when you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "emily.":::['5-2-74']
it's good that you had such a good time in greece.:::['5-2-75']
i didn't have a good time in greece!:::['5-2-77']
ross abandoned me!:::['5-2-78']
i couldn't get a plane out. i had to stay in their suite!:::['5-2-79']
people came up to me going, "mrs. geller! why are you cry?":::['5-2-80']
i mean, it was so humiliating!:::['5-2-81']
i felt like such an idiot!:::['5-2-82']
it's all my fault. you know why?:::['5-2-83']
because i make very bad decisions.:::['5-2-84']
oh, that's not true.:::['5-2-85']
yes, it is true. i went after ross in stupid london!:::['5-2-86']
london is stupid! stupid!:::['5-2-87']
i should've never gone to london.:::['5-2-88']
from now on, you make all my decisions for me.:::['5-2-89']
oh, no. i did that for someone once.:::['5-2-90']
i'm not comfortable having that power over someone's life.:::['5-2-91']
fine. monica, you are now in charge of my love life.:::['5-2-93']
okay. i got to go to work.:::['5-2-94']
and, uh, rachel, great to have you back.:::['5-2-95']
pheebs!:::['5-2-96']
always a pleasure.:::['5-2-97']
rachel? sweetie, look.:::['5-2-98']
here's a cute picture of you and joey.:::['5-2-99']
he's married.:::['5-2-100', '5-1-83']
ross is married. i still can't believe it.:::['5-2-101']
honey, sweetie, by the edges.:::['5-2-102']
i'll just have to accept it.:::['5-2-103']
i mean, it's my fault.:::['5-2-104']
edges! fingers! smudgy!:::['5-2-105']
that's okay. i know that you're very upset right now.:::['5-2-107']
i know that wasn't about me.:::['5-2-108']
i bet it was about her a little.:::['5-2-109']
if you'd stop thinking about ross......you'd notice there are:::['5-2-110']
great guys everywhere.:::['5-2-111']
look. gunther.:::['5-2-112']
he's nice. he's cute.:::['5-2-113']
yeah. i guess gunther is...:::['5-2-114']
what about that guy over there?:::['5-2-115']
that's the guy you flirted with at the counter.:::['5-2-116']
oh, i don't know. i don't know.:::['5-2-117']
you're going to talk to him.:::['5-2-118']
i make your decisions, and i say you're going to talk to him.:::['5-2-119']
you're the boss. i got to do what you tell me.:::['5-2-121']
say that to him, and you're golden.:::['5-2-122']
hey, pheebs. we got our pictures back from london.:::['5-2-124']
here's all of us at the tower of london...:::['5-2-125']
here we all are.:::['5-2-126']
there's ross and joey and you and...:::['5-2-127']
and me.:::['5-2-128']
we've been talking about london too much.:::['5-2-129']
sorry, it's just because i couldn't be there.:::['5-2-130']
all i get to do now is pregnant stuff. it bums me out.:::['5-2-131']
i'm sorry. sorry.:::['5-2-132']
what happened? a little of this, a little of that.:::['5-2-133']
i got myself a date tomorrow.:::['5-2-134']
see? didn't i tell you? you're getting over ross already.:::['5-2-135']
what took so long?:::['5-2-137']
i got caught up at work. but i'm quitting tomorrow.:::['5-2-138']
so thanks for having me over.:::['5-2-139']
rach...:::['5-2-140']
pheebs...:::['5-2-141']
see you, man.:::['5-2-142']
probably some european goodbye thing he picked up in london.:::['5-2-144']
that's not european.:::['5-2-145']
it felt french.:::['5-2-146']
i really had a good time.:::['5-2-147']
so... so...:::['5-2-149']
i guess this is it.:::['5-2-150']
yeah, um...:::['5-2-151', '5-3-306']
unless you want to come inside? yeah!:::['5-2-152']
oh, uh, wait a minute. you know what? i can't decide this.:::['5-2-153']
okay. just hold on a second.:::['5-2-154']
um, hi.:::['5-2-155']
where's monica? i have to ask her something.:::['5-2-157']
doing her laundry.:::['5-2-158']
it came in the mail today.:::['5-2-160']
it's 72 long-stemmed, red roses.:::['5-2-161']
one for each day i've known and loved emily......cut up into mulch.:::['5-2-162']
honey, that's awful.:::['5-2-163']
it's not so bad.:::['5-2-164']
monica's going to make potpourri.:::['5-2-165']
i think i'm going to go wander out in the rain for a while.:::['5-2-166']
it's not raining.:::['5-2-167']
i can't catch a break.:::['5-2-168']
you're not going anywhere. sit right here.:::['5-2-169']
i'll make you some tea and we'll talk this out.:::['5-2-170']
rachel: hey, dave. yeah.:::['5-2-173']
um, i need to take a rain check. my roommate is really sick.:::['5-2-174']
honey, listen.:::['5-2-176']
i know things seem so bad......and that they won't get any...:::['5-2-177']
could i talk to you?:::['5-2-178']
i dropped some socks.:::['5-2-179']
what is the matter with you? do you want to fall into the trap?:::['5-2-181']
you did not drop any socks!:::['5-2-182']
i saw dave, and he said you blew him off!:::['5-2-183']
you listen to me!:::['5-2-184']
i'm calling the shots! i say you leave ross and go get dave.:::['5-2-185']
well, ultimately i was trying, you know, i wanted......to tell him that:::['5-2-187']
i'm still in love with him.:::['5-2-188']
what? you cannot tell him that!:::['5-2-189']
people love to hear that!:::['5-2-191']
i make the decisions and i say no!:::['5-2-192']
you know what? no, you don't make my decisions, because......you're fired.:::['5-2-193']
you can't fire me.:::['5-2-194']
i make your decisions, and i say i'm not fired. ha!:::['5-2-195']
rachel! come on, let me in!:::['5-2-197']
having some trouble?:::['5-2-198']
rachel locked the door.:::['5-2-199']
i'll kick that door in if you give me some sugar.:::['5-2-200']
rachel! let me in!:::['5-2-201']
rachel? can i talk to you outside for a sec?:::['5-2-203']
we really need to talk.:::['5-2-205']
well, then talk.:::['5-2-206']
remember that thing we just discussed that you wanted to do?:::['5-2-208']
what thing?:::['5-2-210']
rachel wants to take swing dance lessons.:::['5-2-211']
which i think is a really stupid idea.:::['5-2-212']
it's dangerous. she won't get what she wants.:::['5-2-213']
and who knows who she might end up hurting?:::['5-2-214']
monica's right. swing dancing can be tricky.:::['5-2-215']
i have to use the phone.:::['5-2-216']
i got to cancel those five, giant teddy bears i sent to emily.:::['5-2-217']
my god. think of the massacre.:::['5-2-218']
i'm going to do it.:::['5-2-219']
i know you think i'm crazy.:::['5-2-220']
but before you tell him, try to find one person......who thinks it's a good idea.:::['5-2-221']
i bet you can't.:::['5-2-222']
joey! i'm in!:::['5-2-225']
joey: all right. good deal.:::['5-2-226']
all: pheebs! hey!:::['5-2-227']
uh, pheebs? yeah?:::['5-2-228']
um, you know how you were saying you didn't get to go to london......and you were feeling left out?:::['5-2-229']
well, we all felt really bad about that......so we decided to:::['5-2-231']
take a little trip together.:::['5-2-232']
oh, that's so nice!:::['5-2-233']
how great! where's the trip?:::['5-2-234']
well, we thought we would all go to a picnic......in central park!:::['5-2-235']
central park?:::['5-2-236']
all of us. all day.:::['5-2-237']
that sucks!:::['5-2-238']
that's not a trip! i just came from there.:::['5-2-239']
what'll we high-five about at the stupid park?:::['5-2-240']
it's right by my house. all right!:::['5-2-241']
i'm going home to bask in the triumph of my central park idea.:::['5-2-242']
hold on a sec there, mr. kissy.:::['5-2-243']
i wanted to talk to you about......this whole new european thing:::['5-2-244']
you've got going on.:::['5-2-245']
and i need to say it makes me very uncomfortable......and i just, you know, just stop it!:::['5-2-246']
just bringing some culture to the group.:::['5-2-247']
that's fine. just don't bring it in my mouth.:::['5-2-248']
it makes me want to puke.:::['5-2-249']
hey, everybody! pheebs is here!:::['5-2-250']
all: phoebe! whoo! phoebe: okay. whoo! hi!:::['5-2-251']
pheebs, we decided that the picnic idea was a little...:::['5-2-252']
it didn't have any... well, it blew.:::['5-2-253']
we thought that this afternoon we'd all go away for the whole weekend......to atlantic city.:::['5-2-254']
ooh, atlantic city! oh, that's a great plan! whose plan was that?:::['5-2-255']
wait. it was my plan. joey: no......i said we needed a new plan.:::['5-2-257']
and i came up with atlantic city.:::['5-2-258']
which is the new plan.:::['5-2-259']
why don't we, um, all meet upstairs in an hour?:::['5-2-260']
i'm going to go pack. i'm going to go pack my ass off.:::['5-2-262']
let's go.:::['5-2-263', '3-17-298', '3-16-326']
you know what? i'll meet you in a minute.:::['5-2-264']
rachel, you didn't find anyone, so you can't tell him.:::['5-2-265']
you know what? that doesn't matter.:::['5-2-266']
do you know how painful it is to tell someone you love them......and not have them say it back?:::['5-2-267']
i can't watch.:::['5-2-270', '3-19-184']
what you reading?:::['5-2-271']
paper.:::['5-2-272']
yeah? what's it about?:::['5-2-273']
the events from around the globe.:::['5-2-274']
uh, there's something i have to talk to you about.:::['5-2-276']
everyone's saying i shouldn't.:::['5-2-277']
but i think they're wrong. people can be wrong.:::['5-2-278']
once at work......i thought carbon dating:::['5-2-279']
is fossilized...:::['5-2-280']
i'm really trying to tell you something here.:::['5-2-281']
i think i'm just going to say it.:::['5-2-284']
i'm just going to say it.:::['5-2-285']
i'm still in love with you, ross.:::['5-2-287']
wow, uh...:::['5-2-288']
huh. i'm...:::['5-2-289']
wow. i'm not sure what to do with that right now.:::['5-2-290']
what? was that a joke? because it's mean.:::['5-2-291']
i'm so dead serious.:::['5-2-292']
i'm totally serious.:::['5-2-293']
because i just heard it!:::['5-2-295']
i heard it! and it's ridiculous!:::['5-2-296']
you're married!:::['5-2-298']
you're married, and it's just ridiculous.:::['5-2-299']
when i said it, i sort of floated up out of my body.:::['5-2-300']
and then i heard myself say it, and then the floating rachel...:::['5-2-301']
i was like, "you are such an idiot!":::['5-2-302']
well, i am married. rachel: i know.:::['5-2-303']
though i haven't spoken to her since the wedding.:::['5-2-304']
i'm sorry. that's not funny.:::['5-2-305']
actually, it kind of is.:::['5-2-306']
my wife won't return my calls.:::['5-2-307']
i don't know where my wife is.:::['5-2-308']
"hey, ross! where's the missus?" "don't know!":::['5-2-309']
you know what? could you forget i told you this?:::['5-2-312']
well, i kind of have to.:::['5-2-313']
because the thing is...:::['5-2-314']
the thing is, you know, that you're married to emily.:::['5-2-315']
that is what the thing is.:::['5-2-316']
things won't be weird between us, right? was that stupid?:::['5-2-318']
me telling you that?:::['5-2-319']
no, no. i'm glad you did.:::['5-2-320']
if nothing else......it's always great when someone:::['5-2-321']
tells you they love you.:::['5-2-322']
that's what i said!:::['5-2-323']
thank you for being so nice. ross: no. thank you for...:::['5-2-324']
okay, let's go! yeah, atlantic city!:::['5-2-326']
ross: come on!:::['5-2-327']
atlantic city, baby!:::['5-2-328']
let's roll some bones. hey, joey!:::['5-2-329']
high-five for rolling bones.:::['5-2-330']
uh, pheebs, you're leaking.:::['5-2-334']
oh, my god. your water broke.:::['5-2-335']
oh! okay!:::['5-2-336']
well, don't worry. i call shotgun.:::['5-2-337']
pheebs, we have to take you to the hospital now.:::['5-2-338']
pheebs, the babies are coming now.:::['5-2-339']
honey! high-five! the babies are coming!:::['5-2-340']
all: whoo!:::['5-2-341']
remember when my water broke?:::['5-2-342']
phoebe's going to have her babies.:::['5-2-343']
i know. it's beautiful and amazing.:::['5-2-344']
i had to kiss phoebe and rachel every time i left the room.:::['5-2-345']
it's too bad they didn't see us having sex.:::['5-2-346']
do you know anything about women?:::['5-2-347']
it's all right. okay.:::['5-2-349']
hi. yeah, hi. i'm, um, phoebe buffay and i have babies coming out.:::['5-3-1']
okay. have you started having contractions?:::['5-3-2']
not yet. um, i heard they really hurt. do they?:::['5-3-3']
well... oh, my god.:::['5-3-4']
which of you is the father?:::['5-3-5']
none of them are. the father is my brother.:::['5-3-6']
i'll miss watching you freak people out like that.:::['5-3-8']
joey: pheebs...:::['5-3-9']
this is for the babies to look at someday.:::['5-3-10']
do you want to say anything before it starts?:::['5-3-11']
hi, kids! um, it's me, aunt phoebe.:::['5-3-13']
can't wait to see you. please don't hurt me.:::['5-3-14']
what took you so long?:::['5-3-15']
your cab left when ours did.:::['5-3-16']
we went back because i forgot my jacket.:::['5-3-17']
you're not wearing one.:::['5-3-18']
oh, man! i did it again!:::['5-3-19']
someone has to call frank and alice.:::['5-3-20']
my mom might... what are you doing?:::['5-3-21']
i've got to get the before shot.:::['5-3-22']
we spoke to the nurse. the reason your doctor is late......is because, uh, she's not coming.:::['5-3-23']
what? she hit her head in the shower.:::['5-3-24']
oh, my god. she's so stupid!:::['5-3-25']
pheebs, it's going to be okay.:::['5-3-26']
i don't see three kids coming out of your vagina.:::['5-3-27']
listen. the nurse said the doctor is wonderful.:::['5-3-28']
he's head of the department.:::['5-3-29']
all right. ooh. oh, dear god, save me.:::['5-3-30']
i'm having my first contraction.:::['5-3-31']
oh, it's not bad. chandler: okay.:::['5-3-32']
and so the miracle of birth begins. and i...:::['5-3-33']
something hurts.:::['5-3-35']
ooh, it's sympathy pains. oh, that's so sweet.:::['5-3-36']
i didn't know i cared that much.:::['5-3-37']
hello. hi.:::['5-3-38']
i'm dr. harad. i'll be delivering your babies.:::['5-3-39']
you'll be in good hands. i've been doing this a long time.:::['5-3-40']
i'll be back to do your internal.:::['5-3-41']
just relax, everything looks great.:::['5-3-42']
and also, i love fonzie.:::['5-3-43']
did he just say he loves fonzie?:::['5-3-44']
that's what it sounded like.:::['5-3-45']
am i late? nobody came out yet, right?:::['5-3-48']
no, we haven't started yet. where's alice?:::['5-3-49']
uh, delaware. until she gets here, i'll be your coach.:::['5-3-50']
don't worry. she told me about the lamazda stuff.:::['5-3-51']
if you get the babies out by month's end......you get two percent financing.:::['5-3-52']
monica, you're going to be very proud of me.:::['5-3-54']
i just got us dates with two unbelievably cute nurses.:::['5-3-55']
they're male nurses.:::['5-3-57']
heh, heh. not in my head.:::['5-3-58']
they want to take us out saturday night. what do you say?:::['5-3-59']
i don't think so. what?:::['5-3-61']
you've been telling me to get over ross and move on.:::['5-3-63']
i'm moving on and so are you.:::['5-3-64']
why don't you want to go?:::['5-3-65']
why don't you give me a good reason......and i'll tell you if it's true.:::['5-3-67']
what? harder than it sounds, isn't it?:::['5-3-68']
you're coming. and when they get off......we'll go get some jello with them.:::['5-3-69']
yep. there's always room for jello.:::['5-3-70']
how do you make that dirty?:::['5-3-71']
it's easy. i can do it with anything.:::['5-3-72']
grandma's chicken salad...:::['5-3-73']
get a shot of this.:::['5-3-75']
hey, babies, these are the headlines when you were born.:::['5-3-76']
now girl baby, turn away. and boy babies......check it out.:::['5-3-77']
this is what naked women looked like when you were born.:::['5-3-78']
now let's dive into the good stuff.:::['5-3-79']
okay, i'm having another one.:::['5-3-80']
this one doesn't hurt eith... ooh, yes, it does! ow.:::['5-3-81']
ooh, i was kind of hoping that was it.:::['5-3-84']
where are monica and rachel, anyway?:::['5-3-85']
a couple of nurses asked them out. maybe they're with them.:::['5-3-86']
really? male nurses?:::['5-3-87']
yeah, i was bummed too.:::['5-3-88']
so they're going on dates?:::['5-3-89']
when? i think saturday.:::['5-3-90']
what's with him? um, sympathy pains.:::['5-3-91']
it was sweet at first, but now i think he's trying to steal my thunder.:::['5-3-92']
let's see what we got here.:::['5-3-94']
oh, you know, fonzie dated triplets.:::['5-3-95']
this fonzie person you keep referring to......is that another doctor?:::['5-3-96']
fonzie is the nickname of arthur fonzerelli.:::['5-3-98']
the fonz.:::['5-3-99']
it's not that weird, is it?:::['5-3-102']
it's very weird.:::['5-3-103']
i don't want some guy down there telling me i'm "dilated-a-mundo.":::['5-3-104']
he doesn't seem to be impersonating fonzie...:::['5-3-105']
why are you defending him? just get me another doctor......who isn't crazy:::['5-3-107']
and doesn't fonzie!:::['5-3-108']
again, it's not... aah! aah!:::['5-3-109']
um, there's something you should know.:::['5-3-111']
is this about you dating the nurse? joey told me.:::['5-3-112']
i am so fine. you and i, we're just, nothing.:::['5-3-113']
just goofing around.:::['5-3-114']
um, i was about to tell you i was getting out of it.:::['5-3-115']
but, um, if we're just "goofing around," maybe i will go out with him.:::['5-3-116']
fine. maybe i will too.:::['5-3-117']
hey! look what i found in the gift shop...:::['5-3-118']
oh. get up! get up! get up!:::['5-3-119']
okay, pheebs?:::['5-3-120']
this is dr. oberman.:::['5-3-121']
he has no strong feelings about fonzie......or any of the happy days gang.:::['5-3-122']
you're going into what grade?:::['5-3-123']
i'm actually a first-year resident. i graduated early.:::['5-3-124']
uh-huh. me too.:::['5-3-125']
ross, i should have specified i'd need a grown-up doctor.:::['5-3-126']
really, i'm fully qualified...:::['5-3-127']
shh, doogie. shh.:::['5-3-128']
doesn't anybody understand that i'm going to be having babies soon? huh?:::['5-3-129']
go, little boy! go!:::['5-3-130']
oh, cool. you made him cry!:::['5-3-131']
mr. tribbiani, i'm afraid you've got kidney stones.:::['5-3-132']
uh, well, what else could it be?:::['5-3-133']
it's kidney stones.:::['5-3-134']
or...:::['5-3-135']
kidney stones.:::['5-3-136', '5-3-173']
you're getting there.:::['5-3-137']
these babies are very, very lucky.:::['5-3-138']
they are? why?:::['5-3-139']
they'll be born on the fonz's half-birthday.:::['5-3-140']
just to clarify.:::['5-3-142']
i'm not fonzie.:::['5-3-143']
it's a terrific thing that you're having these babies for frank and alice.:::['5-3-145']
i know, it is. yeah.:::['5-3-146']
can i tell you a secret? yeah.:::['5-3-147']
i want to keep one.:::['5-3-148']
oh, i'm going to be on the news.:::['5-3-149']
you've gotta be kidding.:::['5-3-150']
you know you can't keep one of these babies.:::['5-3-151']
maybe i can. you don't know.:::['5-3-152']
i do. frank and alice will want to keep all their children.:::['5-3-153']
maybe not. you know?:::['5-3-154']
three babies are a handful.:::['5-3-155']
maybe they'll want to unload one.:::['5-3-156']
i hate to miss an opportunity because i didn't ask.:::['5-3-157']
phoebe, no. this is insane.:::['5-3-158']
just ask him.:::['5-3-159']
what? me?:::['5-3-160']
i can't ask him!:::['5-3-161']
do you know how inappropriate that would be?:::['5-3-162']
all i'm saying is, just talk to frank.:::['5-3-163']
just feel him out.:::['5-3-164']
no. i will not ask frank to give you one of his kids.:::['5-3-165']
tell him it's for you.:::['5-3-167']
feeling better, sweetie?:::['5-3-168']
maybe a little.:::['5-3-169']
wish you hadn't seen me throw up.:::['5-3-170']
hey. i just heard. what's up?:::['5-3-172']
ordinarily, we try to break the stones up with shock waves.:::['5-3-174']
but they're too close to the bladder.:::['5-3-175']
either we wait for you to pass them or else go up the urethra...:::['5-3-176']
no, no, no. nothing is going "up," okay?:::['5-3-178']
"up" is not an option. what's a urethra?:::['5-3-179']
are you crazy?:::['5-3-180', '3-3-129', '3-11-262']
did you ask him?:::['5-3-181']
no, i haven't had a chance yet.:::['5-3-182']
i'm kind of on a clock here.:::['5-3-183']
oh, fonzie.:::['5-3-184']
you know who i always liked? mork.:::['5-3-185']
undo it. undo it. undo it.:::['5-3-186']
fonzie met mork.:::['5-3-187']
mork froze fonzie.:::['5-3-188']
yes......but fonzie was already cool.:::['5-3-190']
so he wasn't hurt. right?:::['5-3-191']
yeah, that's right.:::['5-3-192']
okay. doctor says any minute now.:::['5-3-194']
you know, alice is going to be here so soon.:::['5-3-195']
you couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?:::['5-3-196']
sorry, i'm in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.:::['5-3-197']
dan: hey, rachel. rachel: hi!:::['5-3-198']
this is dan, one of the guys we're going out with on saturday.:::['5-3-199']
dan, monica.:::['5-3-200']
hello, dan.:::['5-3-202']
i'm really looking forward to saturday night. really! really!:::['5-3-203']
so dan...:::['5-3-204']
nurse, not a doctor, huh?:::['5-3-205']
kind of girlie, isn't it?:::['5-3-206']
chandler. that's okay.:::['5-3-207']
i'm doing this to get through medical school.:::['5-3-208']
and it didn't feel "girlie" during the gulf war.:::['5-3-210']
thanks for doing that for us, by the way.:::['5-3-212']
why wait till saturday? are you free tomorrow?:::['5-3-213']
sure. i'll get somebody to cover me.:::['5-3-214']
aw, great.:::['5-3-215']
hey, you and me, saturday night?:::['5-3-216']
no. all right, very good!:::['5-3-217']
this is a big one.:::['5-3-218']
unh! get these things out of me!:::['5-3-219']
breathe! breathe through the pain.:::['5-3-220']
i want the drugs, ross!:::['5-3-221']
i do too! i do too!:::['5-3-222']
yeah, i love you. okay, bye.:::['5-3-223']
that was alice's mom. alice left five hours ago.:::['5-3-225']
she should be here.:::['5-3-226']
she'll make it on time.:::['5-3-227']
so frank...:::['5-3-229']
three babies. whoo, that just seems like a lot, huh?:::['5-3-230']
not to me.:::['5-3-231']
fair enough.:::['5-3-232', '5-17-237']
you're at 10 centimeters. time to start having babies.:::['5-3-233']
i want only the father here.:::['5-3-234']
we love you. good luck.:::['5-3-235']

i don't know if you've looked up "goofing around" in the dictionary.:::['5-3-287']
well, i have......and the technical definition is::::['5-3-288']
"two friends who care a lot about each other......and have amazing sex......and just want to spend:::['5-3-289']
more time together.":::['5-3-290']
but if you have this new dictionary that gets you mad at me......then we have to get you:::['5-3-291']
my original dictionary.:::['5-3-292']
you're better than you think you are. really?:::['5-3-294']
okay. so if...:::['5-3-295']

ugh. i'm just kind of worried about what it might do to our friendship.:::['5-1-61']
ugh. how could we have let this happen? seven times.:::['5-1-63']
you know, look. we were away.:::['5-1-64']
in a foreign, romantic country. right.:::['5-1-65']
i blame london.:::['5-1-66']
bad london.:::['5-1-67']
so look, um......while we're still in london,i mean, we can keep doing it, right?:::['5-1-68']
well, i don't see that we have a choice.:::['5-1-69']
but when we're back home, we don't do it.:::['5-1-70']
only here.:::['5-1-71']

if you don't realize that, i can't help you.:::['5-1-85']
you're right. you can't help me.:::['5-1-87']
jack, is it all our fault? were we bad parents?:::['5-1-88']
oh yeah? well, who serves steak when there's no place to sit?:::['5-1-90']
i mean, how are you supposed to eat this?:::['5-1-91']

the next tour of the wine cellar......will commence in two minutes.:::['5-1-95']
you promised phoebe no meat till she has the babies.:::['5-1-97']
well, i figured we're in another country, so it doesn't count.:::['5-1-98']
that's true. the man's got a point.:::['5-1-99']
i'm sorry things aren't working out so well.:::['5-1-102']
oh, no. ha, ha. it could be better. it's gonna be okay, right?:::['5-1-103']
oh, yeah. of course. i mean, she's gonna get over this, you know?:::['5-1-104']
i mean, so you said my name.:::['5-1-105']
you know, you just said it because you saw me there.:::['5-1-106']
if you'd seen a circus freak, you would've said::::['5-1-107']
i take thee circus freak.:::['5-1-108']
it didn't mean anything. it's just a mistake.:::['5-1-109']
it didn't mean anything.:::['5-1-110']
right? no, no.:::['5-1-111']
of course it didn't mean anything.:::['5-1-112']
i mean, i can understand why emily would think it meant something......you know, because it was you.:::['5-1-113']
but it absolutely didn't. it didn't! it didn't!:::['5-1-114']
ross, hey, the band's ready outside for your first dance with emily.:::['5-1-115']

you spit on me, man.:::['5-1-119']
emily is taking kind of a long time, huh? heh.:::['5-1-121']

to pop the window out of the frame.:::['5-1-123']

huh! oh, my god. rachel. oh, hello, rachel.:::['5-1-130']
ross said my name.:::['5-1-131']
okay? my name.:::['5-1-132']
ross said my name up there.:::['5-1-133']
that obviously means that he still loves me.:::['5-1-134']
okay, don't believe me. i know i'm right.:::['5-1-135']
all right. do you guys want to go and get a drink?:::['5-1-136']

oh, pheebs. it's phoebe.:::['5-1-143']
oh, hey, hey. oh, great.:::['5-1-144']
well, ross said my name.:::['5-1-147']
yeah, i know, but i don't think that means anything.:::['5-1-148']
okay, pheebs, let's look at this objectively.:::['5-1-149']
all right, ninth grade, right?:::['5-1-150']
the obsession starts.:::['5-1-151']
all right? summer after ninth grade......he sees me in a two-piece:::['5-1-152']
for the first time.:::['5-1-153']
his obsession begins to grow, right?:::['5-1-154']
hey, listen, why don't we go change in my room?:::['5-1-155']
my clothes are... oh.:::['5-1-156']
wow, you look... no time for that.:::['5-1-157']
hey, dude. let me in. i got a girl out here.:::['5-1-159']

no, you don't. i just saw you go in there with monica.:::['5-1-161']
well, we're hanging out in here.:::['5-1-162']
which one of us is gonna be having sex in there? me or you?:::['5-1-163']
well, i suppose i would have to say you.:::['5-1-164']
what if we're watching a movie in here? monica: which we are.:::['5-1-165']
and we've already paid for it. it's my giant.:::['5-1-166']
my giant? i love that movie.:::['5-1-167']
you really think this is okay?:::['5-1-168']
well, ross and emily aren't gonna use it.:::['5-1-169']
oh, it's so beautiful.:::['5-1-170']
you know, i don't feel right about this.:::['5-1-172']
oh, monica...:::['5-1-173']
this is the honeymoon suite.:::['5-1-174']
the room expects sex.:::['5-1-175']
the room would be disappointed if it didn't get sex.:::['5-1-176']
all the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.:::['5-1-177']
both: okay.:::['5-1-178', '5-16-11', '4-12-300', '3-13-340']
emily? nope. not under here.:::['5-1-179']
you didn't find her? no, i've looked everywhere.:::['5-1-180']
well, you couldn't have, or else you would've found her.:::['5-1-181']
i think you should keep looking. yeah. for about, uh, 30 minutes?:::['5-1-182']
or 45?:::['5-1-183']
wow, in 45 minutes, you could find her twice.:::['5-1-184']
no. for all i know, she's trying to find me......but couldn't because:::['5-1-185']
i kept moving around.:::['5-1-186']
no, from now on, i'm staying in one place.:::['5-1-187']
right here.:::['5-1-188']
it's getting late. yeah, we're going to go.:::['5-1-189']
actually......do you guys mind:::['5-1-190']
staying here for a while?:::['5-1-191']
ugh. you know, we got to get up early and catch that plane to new york.:::['5-1-192']
yeah, it's a very large plane.:::['5-1-193']
but we'll stay here with you.:::['5-1-195']
thanks, guys. ha, ha.:::['5-1-196']
i really appreciate this, you know, but you don't need to rub my butt.:::['5-1-197']
we have to leave for new york in an hour.:::['5-1-198']
i know. i've been looking at those doors.:::['5-1-199']
they look pretty soundproof, don't you think?:::['5-1-200']
we can't do that. that's insane.:::['5-1-201']
i mean, a, he could wake up. and b, you know......let's go for it.:::['5-1-202']
emily? emily.:::['5-1-203']
emily! nope.:::['5-1-204']
forget about emily. she's not with us. we've come for her things.:::['5-1-205']
she's in hiding. she's utterly humiliated. she doesn't want to see you ever again.:::['5-1-207']
we're very sad that it didn't work out between you and emily, monkey.:::['5-1-208']
but i think you're absolutely delicious.:::['5-1-209']
excuse me, i'm standing right here.:::['5-1-210']
oh, yes.:::['5-1-211', '5-13-252', '3-14-47']
hey. hey, you guys. hurry up. get some. there's a whole cart outside.:::['5-1-213']
goodbye, geller. now, hold on. hold on.:::['5-1-214']
look, look. your daughter and i......are supposed to leave tonight:::['5-1-215']
for our honeymoon.:::['5-1-216']
now, you tell her that i'm gonna be at that airport......and i hope that she'll be there too.:::['5-1-217']
yeah, i said rachel's name, but it didn't mean anything.:::['5-1-218']
she's just a friend. that's all. now, look, just tell emily i love her......and that i can't imagine spending my life:::['5-1-219']
with anyone else.:::['5-1-220']
please, promise me that you'll tell her that.:::['5-1-221']
all right, i'll tell her.:::['5-1-222']
come on, bugger face.:::['5-1-223']
you spend half your life in the bathroom.:::['5-1-225']
why do you never go out the bloody window?:::['5-1-226']
well, maybe it's best we never got to do it again.:::['5-1-227']
yeah, it kind of makes that one night special.:::['5-1-228']
you know, technically, we still are over international waters.:::['5-1-229']
i'm going to the bathroom. maybe i'll see you there in a bit?:::['5-1-230']
felicity and i, we were watching my giant. and i was thinking......i'm never gonna be as good an actor:::['5-1-234']
as that giant.:::['5-1-235']
do you think i'm just wasting my life with this acting thing?:::['5-1-236']
i mean, the giant's like five years younger than me.:::['5-1-238']
you know, you think i'll ever get there?:::['5-1-239']
thanks, man. okay, man.:::['5-1-241']
but what about how much taller he is than me?:::['5-1-242']
i mean, there's no way i can make myself taller now.:::['5-1-243']
and who knows what science will come up with in the future......but, chandler, what if i die:::['5-1-244']
an unsuccessful, regular-size man?:::['5-1-245']
hey, monica. wow, you've been in the bathroom for, like, a half-hour.:::['5-1-246']
had the beef tips, huh?:::['5-1-248']
you ate meat!:::['5-1-250']
you had sex!:::['5-1-251']
no, we didn't. i know you didn't.:::['5-1-252']
i was talking about monica.:::['5-1-253']
phoebe, i did not have sex.:::['5-1-254']
oh, this pregnancy is throwing me all off.:::['5-1-255']
i'm gonna say hi to the chick and duck. oh, me too.:::['5-1-256']
why would you need to say hi? you've been feeding them for four days.:::['5-1-257']
oh, right. maybe i'll just go home.:::['5-1-258']
well, we certainly are alone.:::['5-1-259']
good thing we have that "not new york" rule.:::['5-1-260']
um, listen, since we're on that subject......um, i just wanted to tell you that,um...:::['5-1-262']
well, i was going through a really hard time in london......what with my brother getting married:::['5-1-263']
and that guy thinking i was ross' mother.:::['5-1-264']
well, anyway, i just...:::['5-1-266']
that night meant a lot to me. and i guess i'm trying to say thanks.:::['5-1-267']
you know, that night meant a lot to me too.:::['5-1-269']
and it wasn't because i was in a bad place or anything.:::['5-1-270']
it just meant a lot to me because you're really hot.:::['5-1-271']
is that okay? ha, ha. that's okay.:::['5-1-272']
and i'm cute too?:::['5-1-273']
and you're cute too. thank you.:::['5-1-274']
all right, i got to go unpack. okay.:::['5-1-275']

oh, that counts. oh, good.:::['5-1-278']
rach. hi.:::['5-1-280']
well, i've been on standby for a flight home for hours.:::['5-1-282']

what time are you supposed to leave?:::['5-1-286']
for flight 1066 to athens.:::['5-1-287']
the last call.:::['5-1-288']
pretty soon, i guess.:::['5-1-289']
i just... i don't understand. i mean, how could she do this?:::['5-1-291']
what, am i like a complete idiot......for thinking she'd actually show up?:::['5-1-292']
you're not an idiot, ross.:::['5-1-294']
you're a guy very much in love.:::['5-1-295']
same difference.:::['5-1-296']
woman: all passengers for flight 1066 to athens should now be onboard.:::['5-1-297']
well, that's that.:::['5-1-299']
no, you know what?:::['5-1-300']
i think you should go.:::['5-1-301', '3-16-304']
what? yeah, i do think you should go......by yourself. get some distance.:::['5-1-302']
clear your head. i think it would be really good.:::['5-1-303']
oh, come on, ross. i think it would be really good for you.:::['5-1-305']
i could. i could do that.:::['5-1-306']
i can't even believe her.:::['5-1-308']
you know what? i am going to go.:::['5-1-309']
good. why not?:::['5-1-310']
right? right. right.:::['5-1-311']
thanks. okay, i'll see you back at home.:::['5-1-312']
if i ever get a flight out of here.:::['5-1-313']
hey, well...:::['5-1-314']

why don't you come?:::['5-1-316']
i mean, i have two tickets. why not?:::['5-1-317']
well, i don't know, ross. really?:::['5-1-318']
yeah, yeah. it'd be great. i mean, you can...:::['5-1-319']

yeah. i already have my bell, and later on i get my bucket.:::['5-10-31']
yeah, yeah. i'll be spreading joy to the people.:::['5-10-33']
last year i spread a little joy, but not enough.:::['5-10-34']
so this year, i'm gonna do the whole city. heh.:::['5-10-35']
i knew a girl in high school who did that. she was very popular.:::['5-10-36']
uh, so, pheebs, where are you doing your bell ringing?:::['5-10-37']
they gave me a great spot right by macy's.:::['5-10-38']
they never give such a good corner to a rookie......but i'm the only one who can say:::['5-10-39']
"merry christmas" in 25 languages.:::['5-10-40']
i lied.:::['5-10-41']
oh, my god. okay, you guys, here's danny.:::['5-10-42']

bite me, blondie!:::['5-10-84']
oh, i'm gonna give him something besides joy. just...:::['5-10-86']
that part was perfect for me. i can't believe i didn't get it.:::['5-10-87']
you know what you should do?:::['5-10-89', '5-14-175']
you should make something happen for yourself.:::['5-10-90']
you know, like write a play.:::['5-10-91']
write a movie, huh? what about those good will hunting guys?:::['5-10-92']
come on, ross. be realistic, you know? if i did write something......what are the chances i could:::['5-10-93']
get those guys to star in it?:::['5-10-94']
wait a second. i could star in it! or that.:::['5-10-95']
i can't write, you know. i mean, i'm an actor.:::['5-10-96']
i don't have the discipline that it takes, you know. i can't do it.:::['5-10-97']
i'll help you.:::['5-10-98']
yeah. i'll make up a schedule and make sure you stick to it.:::['5-10-99']
plus it'll give me something to do.:::['5-10-100']
really? you'd do that for me? thanks. yeah.:::['5-10-101']
we'll start off slow. the only thing you have to do tonight......is come up with the name:::['5-10-102']
of your main character.:::['5-10-103']
done. and it can't be joey.:::['5-10-104']
it's not. or joseph.:::['5-10-105']
i just saw danny getting on the subway with a girl......and he had his arm around her.:::['5-10-108']
oh, honey, i'm sorry.:::['5-10-109', '4-2-259']
well, you should be. this is all your fault.:::['5-10-110']
you meddled in our relationship.:::['5-10-111']
you had no relationship.:::['5-10-112']
no, but i was doing my thing, and everything......was going according to the plan!:::['5-10-113']
oh, god. stop with the plan.:::['5-10-114']
unh. so what if you saw him with a girl?:::['5-10-115']
who cares? that doesn't mean anything.:::['5-10-116']
you'll go out on a date with danny and be so charming he'll forget all about......that stupid subway girl.:::['5-10-117']
she was kind of stupid.:::['5-10-118']
you're right. all right. i'm just gonna go on the date.:::['5-10-119']
i'm just gonna go on the date. that is the new plan.:::['5-10-120']
hurry, hurry!:::['5-10-121']
monica: mm.:::['5-10-122']
hey, how do you spell "suspicious"? why?:::['5-10-123']
because i think this character is gonna be suspicious about stuff.:::['5-10-124']
chandler bing, seven, chandler bing, zero.:::['5-10-126']
you're driving me crazy with that.:::['5-10-127']
okay, i'll stop. no, don't stop.:::['5-10-128']
move the bowl further away. ross could make that shot.:::['5-10-129']
well, you suck. but at least you suck at a man's game now.:::['5-10-130']
you wanna play? i can't be playing games.:::['5-10-131']
ross will be home soon. i have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.:::['5-10-132']
well, so play for the next 30 minutes, then you can write until he gets home.:::['5-10-133']
but, listen, what do you say we, uh......crank it up a notch?:::['5-10-135']
i'm intrigued.:::['5-10-136']
all right. all we need is a little lighter fluid.:::['5-10-137']
okay, but be careful. i wanna get our security deposit back.:::['5-10-138']
yeah, i think we said goodbye to that when we invented hammer darts.:::['5-10-139']
do you remember which part of the wall is not spackle?:::['5-10-140']
uh, yeah, right here.:::['5-10-141']
thank you. happy holiday.:::['5-10-142']
no, that's trash, young lady. no, you can't...:::['5-10-143']
hey. stop that young lady! she donated trash!:::['5-10-144']
the charity's on fire!:::['5-10-146']
help! good, thank you. i need that.:::['5-10-147']
what is this? it's 9:00 in the morning.:::['5-10-149']
all right. "a room.:::['5-10-150']
a man enters. he looks suspicious.":::['5-10-151']
joey, you were supposed to have five pages done by now......including an exciting incident.:::['5-10-153']
what is all this? "the official rulebook of fireball.":::['5-10-154']
yeah, that's the game we played.:::['5-10-155']
yeah, it's great. you take a tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl...:::['5-10-156']
this is helping your career, huh? you wanted to be an actor.:::['5-10-158']
not the creator of crazy lawsuit game.:::['5-10-159']
you're right, you're right. i'll get back to work.:::['5-10-160']
and shame on you. you should know better. joey needs to work.:::['5-10-161']
now come on. hey.:::['5-10-162']
no, uh-uh. you can have this back when the five pages are done, huh?:::['5-10-163']
i had a really nice time tonight. so did i.:::['5-10-164']
i'm really glad monica asked us out.:::['5-10-165']
i'd love to ask you in but my sister's visiting.:::['5-10-166']
i think she's asleep on the couch. your sister?:::['5-10-167']
your sister's asleep on the couch?:::['5-10-168']
ah, i saw you with her on the subway and now she's asleep on the couch.:::['5-10-169']
oh, i thought i heard you. oh, hey, great, you're up.:::['5-10-171']
rachel, my sister krista. krista, rachel.:::['5-10-172']
hi. nice to meet you.:::['5-10-173']

like it would help. you are so bad.:::['5-10-175']
you are. you are.:::['5-10-176']
you are. you are. you are. you are!:::['5-10-177']
you are so dead. ha.:::['5-10-178']
i'm gonna get you. come here. aah!:::['5-10-179']
come here. come here! ha-ha-ha!:::['5-10-180']
um, it's very nice to meet you.:::['5-10-181']
nobody. nobody respects the bucket.:::['5-10-182']
you wouldn't believe what people put in here.:::['5-10-183']
look. okay, does this look like......a garbage can to you?:::['5-10-184']
does it look like an ashtray? no.:::['5-10-186']
does it look like a urinal?:::['5-10-187']
so, pheebs, you gonna go back out there? yeah, but i'm not gonna take any more crap.:::['5-10-189']
okay? no more mrs. nice bucket.:::['5-10-190']
yeah, good for you. you're tough. you lived on the street.:::['5-10-191']
yeah, i'm gonna go back to being street phoebe.:::['5-10-192']
yeah. oh, but you know what? i can't go totally back......because street phoebe really:::['5-10-193']
wouldn't be friends with you guys.:::['5-10-194']
um, can i ask you guys something? monica & ross: sure.:::['5-10-196']
um, i don't have any brothers so i don't know, but did you guys wrestle?:::['5-10-197']
oh, yeah. all the time.:::['5-10-198']
in fact, i was undefeated.:::['5-10-199']
well, you weighed 200 pounds.:::['5-10-200']
still, i was quick as a cat.:::['5-10-201']
well, i met danny's sister yesterday.:::['5-10-202']
uh, that was the girl on the subway. monica: oh, you're kidding.:::['5-10-203']
and they were very, you know......wrestle-y.:::['5-10-204']
but i guess that's normal?:::['5-10-205']
we don't wrestle now.:::['5-10-206']
not since i got too strong for you. ha, ha.:::['5-10-207']
too strong for me? yeah.:::['5-10-208']
you wanna go right now?:::['5-10-209']
because i'll take you right now, buddy. you wanna go?:::['5-10-210']
oh, fine.:::['5-10-211']
wrestle!:::['5-10-213']
okay, you know what, um?:::['5-10-214']
actually, that's great. that helps a lot. thanks.:::['5-10-215']
guys, come on, let's go. the puck drops in 20 minutes. come on.:::['5-10-216']
joey's not going. i didn't finish my five pages.:::['5-10-217']
why can't you finish them tomorrow?:::['5-10-218']
because tomorrow he's redoing yesterday's pages.:::['5-10-219']
yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work.:::['5-10-220']
why don't you cut him a little slack? maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.:::['5-10-221']
i think he's been relaxing enough, thanks to you......and fireball.:::['5-10-222']
if you think fireball's relaxing, you obviously have never played.:::['5-10-223']
the only reason you're doing this to joey is you're bored.:::['5-10-224']
it's not his fault that you're unemployed.:::['5-10-225']
look, look. guys, don't fight.:::['5-10-227']
and the reason i'm doing this is because i am joey's friend.:::['5-10-228']
and if you were a good friend, you'd be doing the same thing.:::['5-10-229']
so being a good friend means acting like a jerk?:::['5-10-230']
if it does, then you're an amazing friend of mine.:::['5-10-231']
hey, guys. how about we settle this over a friendly game of fireball, huh?:::['5-10-232']
i'll go unhook the smoke detectors. how about we settle this right now?:::['5-10-233']
there. now no one's going to the game. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-10-234']
i paid for those tickets. no, you didn't.:::['5-10-235']
you said you would, but you never did. oh, yeah.:::['5-10-236']
so we finally get to the top of the mountain, ahem......and airhead here forgets the camera.:::['5-10-237']
you know, that same thing happened to me one time.:::['5-10-238']
when did that happen to you?:::['5-10-239']
don't you remember? we were jogging in the park, we saw that pretty bird.:::['5-10-240']
and i wanted to take a picture but i didn't have my camera.:::['5-10-241']
okay. first of all, chasing the churro guy is not jogging.:::['5-10-242']
oh, this is so good. you have got to try it.:::['5-10-243']
hmm. mm.:::['5-10-244']
that is good.:::['5-10-245']
oh, damn. i got it on my pants. here, i'll get it.:::['5-10-246']
danny: mm.:::['5-10-247']
we better take these off or that stain will set.:::['5-10-248']
i wanna wear these pants on our date tonight. oh, great.:::['5-10-249']
okay, bye. oh, my god.:::['5-10-250']
that was unbelievable. okay, see? i told you.:::['5-10-251']
yeah, wow. sorry, rach. i don't believe they're brother and sister.:::['5-10-252']
they're brother and sister?:::['5-10-253']
wait a minute. open your hand. let me take a look.:::['5-10-255']
quarter, dime. lint? not interested in that.:::['5-10-256']
what's this? a canadian coin? get out of here!:::['5-10-257']
gosh.:::['5-10-258']
whoa. no drinks near the bucket.:::['5-10-259']
set it down over there and then you can make a contribution.:::['5-10-260']
and you can leave the "hurt bunny" look over there too.:::['5-10-261']
hi, bob. i thought i told you to get out of here!:::['5-10-262']
uh, phoebe, we've been getting complaints.:::['5-10-263']
and we're gonna move you to a less high-profile spot.:::['5-10-264']
uh, ginger's gonna take over this corner. that chick can't handle my corner.:::['5-10-266']
look, either you leave or we remove you.:::['5-10-267']
all right, i'll give you one pointer. look out for that bitch.:::['5-10-269']
oh, hey, rach. i thought we said 7. yeah, uh, you know what? uh, let's skip it.:::['5-10-270']
what? uh, why?:::['5-10-271']
um... look.:::['5-10-272']
you and your sister seem to have, um, a very special bond...:::['5-10-273']
oh, great. that "special bond" again.:::['5-10-274']
why do women have such a problem with the fact that i'm close with my sister?:::['5-10-275']
okay, look, i don't know, but... do you have brothers?:::['5-10-276']
no, i have two sisters, but one of them actually has a very masculine energy.:::['5-10-277']
are you close with them? no, no. they're not very nice people.:::['5-10-278']
okay, come here. listen.:::['5-10-279']
i really like you, okay? i think this could go somewhere.:::['5-10-280']
so what if i'm close to my family? you gonna let that stand in the way of us?:::['5-10-281']
well, i... i don't know...:::['5-10-282']
see, when you put it that way, you know...:::['5-10-283']
danny, hurry up. the bath's getting cold.:::['5-10-284']
what? yeah, okay, i'll see you later.:::['5-10-285']
oh, hey. there's some kids playing in the street.:::['5-10-286']
you wanna go down there, give them a project, ruin their day?:::['5-10-287']
hey, if they have a ball, maybe you could stick razor blades in it......and teach them a new game::::['5-10-288']
"gonna-need-stitches ball.":::['5-10-289']
hey, guys. i was at the library all morning and i already finished my five pages for today.:::['5-10-290']
great. now we can go to the ranger game last night.:::['5-10-291']
no, dude. ross tore up the tickets.:::['5-10-292']
i guess when you don't have so many distractions, it's easier for you to focus, huh?:::['5-10-293']
yeah, or also when you don't have somebody breathing down your neck all the livelong day!:::['5-10-294']
well, that's fine, but the important thing is i finished it. and i think it's really good.:::['5-10-295']
but you know what would help me, is if i could hear it. would you guys read it for me?:::['5-10-296']
yeah, all right. all right.:::['5-10-297']
okay. "it's a typical new york city apartment.:::['5-10-298']
two guys are hanging out." ross?:::['5-10-299']
"hey, man." "what is up?":::['5-10-300']
"about yesterday. i was really wrong. i am sorry.":::['5-10-301']
"no, it was me. i'm sorry. i overreacted.":::['5-10-302']
"maybe it was both of us. but we had our best friend's inter...:::['5-10-303']
but we had our best friend's interest at heart.":::['5-10-304']
"could i be more sorry?":::['5-10-305']
"i don't know. i am one sorry......polontologist.":::['5-10-306']
all right, joey, we get it.:::['5-10-307']
oh, no, no, no. keep reading. the good part's coming up. keep going.:::['5-10-309']
"i am sorry, chandler.":::['5-10-310']
"i am sorry, ross.":::['5-10-311']
ahem. "a handsome man enters.":::['5-10-312']
"hey. how's it going, guys?:::['5-10-313']
i don't know what you two are talking about, but i'd just like to say thanks to both of you.:::['5-10-314']
you. you wouldn't let me give up on myself.:::['5-10-315']
and you. well, you co-created fireball.:::['5-10-316']
the end." yeah.:::['5-10-317']
this took you all day?:::['5-10-318']
no, no, this only took five minutes.:::['5-10-319']
i spent the rest of the day coming up with new ultimate fireball. ha, ha!:::['5-10-320']
okay. "it's a typical new york apartment.:::['5-10-321']
two girls are just hanging out." go.:::['5-10-322']
"hi, how are you doing, kelly?" "i'm doing just fine.:::['5-10-323']
god, tiffany, you smell so great.":::['5-10-324']
"it's my new perfume.:::['5-10-325']
why don't you come closer where you can really appreciate it?":::['5-10-326']
oh, you know, joey, you are sick. this is disgusting.:::['5-10-327']
i'm not reading this.:::['5-10-328']
what? wait, wait, wait. the handsome man was about to enter!:::['5-10-329']
is there any entertainment there?:::['5-11-0']
all right. here we go. 1999, the year of joey.:::['5-11-1']
we're very happy for you.:::['5-11-2']
we wanted to kiss at midnight, but nobody else is going to so, you know...:::['5-11-4']
all right, i'll take care of it. oh, no.:::['5-11-5']
thirty-three, 32, 31. ross, ross, ross.:::['5-11-7']
listen, who are you kissing at midnight? rachel or phoebe?:::['5-11-8']
what? well, you gotta kiss someone.:::['5-11-9']
can't kiss your sister. who's gonna kiss my sister?:::['5-11-10']
chandler. oh, man. really?:::['5-11-11']
who would you rather have kiss your sister?:::['5-11-12']
that's a good point. yeah.:::['5-11-13']
uh, well, since i have that whole history with rachel, i guess phoebe.:::['5-11-14']
okay, great. pheebs, pheebs. listen. ross wants to kiss you at midnight.:::['5-11-15']
so obvious. why doesn't he just ask?:::['5-11-16']
rach, rach. listen, i'm going to kiss you at midnight.:::['5-11-17']
what? you can't kiss ross. you got the history.:::['5-11-18']
would you prefer me or chandler? oh, good point.:::['5-11-20']
all: three, two, one.:::['5-11-21']
happy new year!:::['5-11-22']
happy new year. happy new year.:::['5-11-23']
happy new year, pheebs. you too.:::['5-11-24']
happy new year, joey.:::['5-11-25']
so that do anything for you?:::['5-11-26']
i'm going to go out on a limb and say, "no divorces in '99.":::['5-11-28']
but your divorce isn't even final yet.:::['5-11-29']
just the one divorce in '99.:::['5-11-30']
you know what? i'm gonna be happy this year.:::['5-11-31']
i'm gonna make myself happy.:::['5-11-32']
do you want us to leave the room or?:::['5-11-33']
every day, i am going to do one thing i have never done before.:::['5-11-34']
that, my friends, is my new year's resolution.:::['5-11-35']
ooh. that's a good one. ross: yeah?:::['5-11-36']
mine is to pilot a commercial jet.:::['5-11-37']
that's a good one too. now you only have to find a planeload of people......whose resolution is:::['5-11-38']
to plummet to their deaths.:::['5-11-39']
maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends.:::['5-11-40']
especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free......on their own plane.:::['5-11-41']
she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose......than you do of not making fun of us.:::['5-11-42']
in fact, i'll bet you 50 bucks you can't go the whole year without making fun of us.:::['5-11-43']
you know what? better yet, a week.:::['5-11-44']
i'll take that bet, my friend.:::['5-11-45']
and you know what? paying me the 50 bucks can be......the "new thing you do" that day.:::['5-11-46']
and it starts right now.:::['5-11-47']
all right, my new year's resolution is to learn how to play guitar.:::['5-11-48']
really? how come? ross: ah.:::['5-11-49']
you know those special skills i have listed on my résumé?:::['5-11-50']
i would love it if one of those was true.:::['5-11-51']
do you want me to teach you? i'm a great teacher.:::['5-11-52']
really? who have you taught?:::['5-11-53']
well, i taught me and i loved me.:::['5-11-54']
that'd be great. yeah, thanks, pheebs.:::['5-11-55']
oh, look. blaire forgot her glasses.:::['5-11-56']
she's gonna be needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend.:::['5-11-57']
who, from what i hear, needs to keep his stapler......in his desk drawer,if you know what i'm talking about.:::['5-11-58']
hey, rach, maybe your resolution should be to, um, gossip less.:::['5-11-59']
what? i don't gossip.:::['5-11-60']
maybe sometimes i find out things.:::['5-11-61']
or i hear something and i pass that information on.:::['5-11-62']
you know, kind of like a public service.:::['5-11-63']
doesn't mean i'm a gossip. i mean, would you call ted koppel a gossip?:::['5-11-64']
well, if ted koppel talked about his coworkers' botched boob jobs......yeah, i would.:::['5-11-65']
well, they were like this.:::['5-11-66']
i just asked that girl out.:::['5-11-69']
nice. nice. yeah.:::['5-11-70']
is that part of your resolution, your "new thing" for today?:::['5-11-71']
yes, it is. see?:::['5-11-72']
"elizabeth......hornswoggle"?:::['5-11-73']
elizabeth hornswoggle.:::['5-11-75']
hornswoggle.:::['5-11-76']
you okay, chandler? is there something...?:::['5-11-77']
something funny about that name?:::['5-11-78']
no, no, i just think that maybe i've heard it somewhere before.:::['5-11-79']
oh, really? where?:::['5-11-80']
somewhere funny i'll bet.:::['5-11-81']
hey, pheebs. guess what? hey.:::['5-11-82']
uh, i have a date with, uh, elizabeth hornswoggle.:::['5-11-83']
hornswoggle?:::['5-11-84']
oh, this must be killing you.:::['5-11-85']
all right, see you later. see you.:::['5-11-86']
all right, pheebs, i am ready for my first lesson.:::['5-11-87']
okay. oh, no, no, you don't touch the guitar.:::['5-11-88']
no, no. first you learn here, then you learn here.:::['5-11-89']
oh. okay. phoebe: okay.:::['5-11-90']
okay. lesson one: chords. joey: ah.:::['5-11-91']
now, um, i don't know the actual names of the chords, um...:::['5-11-92']
but i made up names for the way my hand looks while i'm doing them.:::['5-11-93']
so then, this is "bear claw.":::['5-11-94']
okay, "turkey leg"......and "old lady.":::['5-11-95']
what an interesting approach to guitar instruction.:::['5-11-96']
you know, some might find it amusing. i myself find it regular.:::['5-11-97']
hey, everybody.:::['5-11-98', '3-25-244']
rachel was so good today. she didn't gossip at all.:::['5-11-99']
i didn't. even when i found out, um...:::['5-11-100']
all right, let's just say i found out something about someone......and let's just say......she's gonna keep it.:::['5-11-101']
hey, pheebs. check this out.:::['5-11-102']
ooh. you nailed the old lady. oh!:::['5-11-103']
oh, ha, ha!:::['5-11-104']
hey, listen, i thought i was getting better......so on my way home today:::['5-11-105']
i stopped by this guitar store...:::['5-11-106']
did you touch any of the guitars while you were there?:::['5-11-107']
did you?:::['5-11-108']
give me your hands.:::['5-11-110']
strings.:::['5-11-111']
pick.:::['5-11-112']
do you want to learn to play guitar?:::['5-11-113']
yes. then don't touch one!:::['5-11-114']
hi, ben. auntie monica.:::['5-11-116']
ross is wearing leather pants.:::['5-11-118']
does nobody else see that ross is wearing leather pants?:::['5-11-119']
someone comment on the pants.:::['5-11-120']
i think they're very nice. i really like them a lot.:::['5-11-121']
not what i had in mind.:::['5-11-122']
see, people like ross don't generally wear these types of pants.:::['5-11-123']
you see, they're very tight.:::['5-11-124']
maybe there's something in that area?:::['5-11-125']
i think they look really good. i like them.:::['5-11-126']
yeah, where did you get them?:::['5-11-127']
see, i needed a new thing for today.:::['5-11-128']
and there's this leather store i go by that always smells so good.:::['5-11-129']
and i thought to myself, "wow. you know, i've never owned......a really good-smelling:::['5-11-130']
pair of pants before.":::['5-11-131']
okay, seriously. what do you think?:::['5-11-133']
joey: you look like a freak. yeah, awful. both: awful.:::['5-11-134']
hey. what are you doing? what are you doing?:::['5-11-135']
it's my new year's resolution. to blind my child?:::['5-11-136']
no, to take more pictures of all of us together.:::['5-11-137']
i really think it's the best resolution. everyone can enjoy them.:::['5-11-138']
well, everyone will enjoy my music as well.:::['5-11-139']
ross: my god, these pants. i'm burning up.:::['5-11-141']
oh, god. she wants to snuggle now? what, is she trying to kill me?:::['5-11-142']
it's like a volcano in here.:::['5-11-143']
are you hot? no.:::['5-11-144']
okay, it must just be me then.:::['5-11-145']
that was just the pants and the couch.:::['5-11-146']
um, hey, do you mind if i use your bathroom?:::['5-11-147']
oh, go ahead. thanks.:::['5-11-148']
elizabeth: hey, my favorite part's coming up.:::['5-11-150']
tiger. dragon.:::['5-11-153']

joseph, did you even study at all last night?:::['5-11-155']
yes. yes, i did. then do iceberg.:::['5-11-156']
g-sharp. g-sharp?:::['5-11-157']
have you been studying the real names of the chords?:::['5-11-158']
have you?:::['5-11-159']
what? i didn't touch a guitar.:::['5-11-161']
no, but you're questioning my method.:::['5-11-162']
no, i'm not questioning it, phoebe. i'm saying it's stupid.:::['5-11-163']
you know, none of my other student......thought i was stupid.:::['5-11-166']
your other student was you!:::['5-11-167']
yeah, well, you know, maybe you just need to try a little harder.:::['5-11-168']
maybe i need to try a real teacher.:::['5-11-169']
right here. here. andy cooper. he teaches guitar.:::['5-11-170']
and look. ooh, there's a picture of him with a kid.:::['5-11-171']
yeah, and the kid's got a guitar!:::['5-11-172']
fine. you go learn from your qualified instructor.:::['5-11-173']
but don't come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired......of hearing you play:::['5-11-174']
"bad, bad leroy brown.":::['5-11-175']
baddest man in the whole damn town:::['5-11-176']
oh, fine. take his side.:::['5-11-177']
i'll sneak over as soon as ross picks up ben.:::['5-11-180']
i'll tell rachel i'm gonna be doing laundry for a couple hours.:::['5-11-181']
chandler: laundry. huh. is that my new nickname?:::['5-11-182']
you know what your nickname is, mr. big...:::['5-11-184']
hello? joey, it's ross. i need some help.:::['5-11-185']
uh, chandler's not here.:::['5-11-186']
well, you can help me.:::['5-11-187']
okay. listen.:::['5-11-188']
i'm in elizabeth's bathroom.:::['5-11-189']
no, i got really hot in my leather pants so i took them off.:::['5-11-191']
but they must have shrunk from the sweat or something.:::['5-11-192']
or my legs expanded from the heat.:::['5-11-193']
i can't get them back on, joey. i can't.:::['5-11-194']
oh. that is quite a situation.:::['5-11-195']
uh, do you see any, like, powder?:::['5-11-196']
powder. yeah, yeah, i have powder.:::['5-11-197']
good, good. okay.:::['5-11-198']
sprinkle some on your legs. it'll absorb moisture.:::['5-11-199']
then you can get your pants back on.:::['5-11-200']
yeah, hold on.:::['5-11-201']
they're not coming on, man.:::['5-11-202']
um, you see any...? oh, vaseline?:::['5-11-203']
i see lotion. i have lotion. will that work?:::['5-11-204']
yeah, sure, throw some of that on there. hold on.:::['5-11-205']
ross, you okay?:::['5-11-206']
they're still not coming on, man.:::['5-11-207']
and the lotion and the powder have made a paste.:::['5-11-208']
uh, what color is it?:::['5-11-210']
what difference does that make?:::['5-11-211']
well, if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself paste pants......and she won't know the difference.:::['5-11-212']
joey, do you have a minute?:::['5-11-213']
dude, what am i...?:::['5-11-214']
rachel's here, so good luck, man. let me know how it works out.:::['5-11-215']
oh, joey, i have such a problem.:::['5-11-216']
oh, well, your timing couldn't be better.:::['5-11-217']
i'm putting out fires all over the place.:::['5-11-218']
okay, okay. joey, i have got to tell you something.:::['5-11-219']
what is it? what is it?:::['5-11-220']
oh, my god. it's so huge. but you have to promise me, you cannot tell anyone.:::['5-11-221']
no, no, no. i don't want to know. what?:::['5-11-222']
yes, yes, yes. you do want to know. this is unbelievable.:::['5-11-223']
i don't care, rach. look, i'm tired of being the guy who knows all the secrets......and can't tell anyone.:::['5-11-224']
you know secrets? what are they?:::['5-11-225']
and you're not supposed to be gossiping.:::['5-11-226']
no, i know, i can't keep this in. so i pick up the phone...:::['5-11-227']
joey: i'm not listening to you.:::['5-11-228']
ross? um...:::['5-11-229']
you've been in there for a long time.:::['5-11-230']
i'm starting to get kind of freaked out.:::['5-11-231']
ross: all right, i'm coming out.:::['5-11-232']
hey, can you turn the lights off?:::['5-11-233']
no. let's just leave the lights on.:::['5-11-234']
i had a problem.:::['5-11-236']
oh, i can't talk to you. i don't have a fancy ad in the yellow pages.:::['5-11-238']
look...:::['5-11-239']
pheebs, i just...:::['5-11-240']
i want to apologize for saying your method was stupid.:::['5-11-241']
and maybe, ask you to be my teacher again?:::['5-11-242']
and i promise, i won't touch a guitar until you say i'm ready.:::['5-11-243']
you really think i'm ready? uh-huh.:::['5-11-244']
wow, cool.:::['5-11-245']
was the chord at least right before...? no.:::['5-11-247']
we heard about your pants. i'm so sorry.:::['5-11-249']
this year was supposed to be great.:::['5-11-250']
well, it's only the second day, and i'm a loser......with stupid leather pants:::['5-11-251']
that don't even fit.:::['5-11-252']
group: you're not a loser.:::['5-11-253']
hey, look. look, ross.:::['5-11-255']
ben drew a picture of you.:::['5-11-256']
huh? you're a cowboy.:::['5-11-257']
because of the leather pants?:::['5-11-259']
ben doesn't think you're a loser. he thinks you're a cowboy.:::['5-11-260']
i mean, that's something.:::['5-11-261']
rachel: it really is something. joey: howdy, partner. hey.:::['5-11-262']
maybe i should get another pair.:::['5-11-263']
ooh, you know, they had some......with fringe all down the sides.:::['5-11-264']
i'm gonna go kiss ben good night.:::['5-11-265']
i can't believe he thinks i'm a cowboy.:::['5-11-266']
i would make a good cowboy.:::['5-11-267']
okay, now that everything's wrapped up here, i'm gonna go do my laundry.:::['5-11-268']
yeah, me too. you know, if this shirt is dirty. yep.:::['5-11-269']
okay, i'm gonna go to.:::['5-11-270']
i'm gonna go to the airport. if i hang around there long enough......someone's bound to leave:::['5-11-271']
one of those planes unattended.:::['5-11-272']
good luck, honey. phoebe: bye.:::['5-11-273']
hey, uh, joey, remember that big thing i was going to tell you about?:::['5-11-274']
i'm not gonna tell you. but if you found out on your own......that would be okay,and then we could talk about it, right?:::['5-11-275']
well, then it wouldn't be a secret. so, yeah, that would be okay. yeah, yeah.:::['5-11-276']
hey, joe, would you mind going over into chandler's bedroom......and getting that book back:::['5-11-278']
that he borrowed from me?:::['5-11-279']
now? you want me to go over there now?:::['5-11-280']
do you know something? do you know something?:::['5-11-282']
i might know something. i might too something too.:::['5-11-283']
what's the thing you know? you tell me what you know.:::['5-11-284']
i can't tell you. then i can't.:::['5-11-285']
how about i go there and walk into chandler's bedroom and see the thing......that i think i know is actually:::['5-11-288']
the thing i think i know.:::['5-11-289']
you know. and you know.:::['5-11-290']
chandler and monica? oh, this is unbelievable.:::['5-11-292']
how long have you known? too long. oh, my god.:::['5-11-293']
rach, i've been dying to talk to someone about this for so long.:::['5-11-294']
listen, listen. you can't say anything to anybody. they're so weird about that.:::['5-11-295']
listen. hey, phoebe. hey.:::['5-11-296']
it's raining. i don't like to fly in the rain so...:::['5-11-297']
oh, i am going to go for a walk in the rain. ha, ha.:::['5-11-298']
oh, yeah, me too.:::['5-11-299']
that's weird.:::['5-11-300', '3-6-154']

oh, good. okay, look. i can't take it anymore. i can't take it anymore.:::['5-11-302']
so you win. okay? here.:::['5-11-303']
pheebs? flying a jet? better make it a spaceship......so you can get back:::['5-11-304']
to your home planet.:::['5-11-305']
and ross. phone call for you today. tom jones. he wants his pants back.:::['5-11-306']
and hornswoggle? what, are you dating a character from fraggle rock?:::['5-11-307']
ah, i can't believe we've never done this. it's so good!:::['5-13-0']
it's so good for monica.:::['5-13-1']
time's up! my turn.:::['5-13-2']
that was half an hour? it's your timer.:::['5-13-3']
chandler: okay. monica: all right.:::['5-13-4']
i don't like to brag about it, but i give the best massages.:::['5-13-5']
all right, then massage me up right nice!:::['5-13-6']
aah! aah! aah.:::['5-13-7']
it's so good, isn't it?:::['5-13-8']
i don't know what i did to deserve it.:::['5-13-9']
say goodbye to sore muscles!:::['5-13-10']
goodbye, muscles!:::['5-13-11']
she gives the worst massages ever.:::['5-13-12']
it was like she was torturing me for information.:::['5-13-13']
i wanted to give it up. i just didn't know what it was!:::['5-13-14']
if it hurts that bad, you should tell her.:::['5-13-15']
for the first time, i'm in a real relationship.:::['5-13-16']
i won't screw that up by telling the truth.:::['5-13-17']
dude, look out!:::['5-13-18']
you almost crushed my hat.:::['5-13-19']
and the bunny got away.:::['5-13-21']
this would be the place where you explain the hat.:::['5-13-22']
there's this play, right?:::['5-13-24']
i'm up for the part of this cool, suave, international guy.:::['5-13-25']
a clothes horse, so i figure......everyone at the audition will:::['5-13-26']
wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.:::['5-13-27']
and you'll make them disappear?:::['5-13-28']
like you could find something this sophisticated.:::['5-13-29']
done!:::['5-13-30', '4-19-145']
if you want to look good, come to the store. i'll help you.:::['5-13-31']
thanks! rachel: sure.:::['5-13-32']
please, take those off!:::['5-13-33']
ross: hey, pheebs. how's it going?:::['5-13-34']
um, only okay. because i just got back from the hospital.:::['5-13-35']
all: are you all right?:::['5-13-36']
i'm fine. but, uh, my grandma sort of died.:::['5-13-37']
all: pheebs, sorry. phoebe: it's okay.:::['5-13-38']
she had a really incredible life.:::['5-13-39']
it's not like i won't see her again. she'll visit.:::['5-13-40']
maybe she's with us right now.:::['5-13-41']
right. she's on a new spiritual plane and she'll come to the coffeehouse.:::['5-13-42']
i just saw two people having sex in a car right outside!:::['5-13-43']
uh, pheebs' grandmother just died.:::['5-13-44']
oh, my god! i'm so sorry.:::['5-13-45']
actually, it's kind of cool. because it's like......you know, one life ends:::['5-13-46']
and another begins.:::['5-13-47']
not the way they're doing it.:::['5-13-48']
what happened? how did she die?:::['5-13-49']
we were in the market......and she bent down to get some yogurt:::['5-13-50']
and never came back up again.:::['5-13-51']
the last thing she said was::::['5-13-53']
"you get the eggs, i'll get the yogurt, and we'll meet at the checkout counter.":::['5-13-54']
we will meet at the checkout counter.:::['5-13-56']
since you're returning all this stuff......you'll have to wear underwear.:::['5-13-57']
all right. you'd better show me that too.:::['5-13-58']
it's missing something.:::['5-13-59']
oh, i know. um, okay.:::['5-13-60']
really? a purse?:::['5-13-61']
it's not a purse. it's a shoulder bag.:::['5-13-62']
it looks like a woman's purse. no.:::['5-13-63']
trust me, all the men are carrying them in the spring catalog.:::['5-13-64']
see, look. men carrying the bag.:::['5-13-65']
see, look. women carrying the bag.:::['5-13-66']
but it is odd how a woman's purse looks so good on me, a man.:::['5-13-67']
exactly. unisex!:::['5-13-68']

he said, um, "nice to meet you, glenda.":::['5-13-141']
i couldn't give him my real name.:::['5-13-142']
you saw the way he ran.:::['5-13-144']
you think he'd talk to the daughter he abandoned?:::['5-13-145']
what did you say to him?:::['5-13-146']
i said i was the executor of the will and i needed to talk to him.:::['5-13-147']
i'm going to meet him at the coffeehouse.:::['5-13-148']
reverend: could everyone take their seats?:::['5-13-149']
i just can't think about that now.:::['5-13-150']
i want to say goodbye to my grandma. all: okay.:::['5-13-151']

and a date with a man.:::['5-13-155']
you know what? make fun all you want. this is a great bag.:::['5-13-156']
and it's as handy as it is becoming.:::['5-13-157']
just because you don't understand something, doesn't make it wrong.:::['5-13-158']
you guys have to get used to the fact that joey......comes with a bag!:::['5-13-159']
i've got to meet my dad.:::['5-13-160']
will you tell him who you are?:::['5-13-161']
not at first. i don't want to freak him out.:::['5-13-162']
but aren't you pissed at him?:::['5-13-163']
this guy abandoned you.:::['5-13-164']
if it were me, this guy would be in some serious physical danger.:::['5-13-165']
i'd walk in there, i'd be like, "yo, dad!:::['5-13-166']
you and me, outside. right now!":::['5-13-167']
i kind of scared myself.:::['5-13-168']
well, at least you scared someone.:::['5-13-169']
you'd think i'd be angry.:::['5-13-170']
you'd think i'd want to rip his tiny little head off!:::['5-13-171']
fortunately, i'm past it.:::['5-13-172']
you do seem a little tense. here, let me help you.:::['5-13-173']
oh, get off! ow!:::['5-13-174']
stop it! why are you doing that to me?:::['5-13-175']
as a masseuse and a human......i'm begging you,never do that to anyone.:::['5-13-177']
i give good massages.:::['5-13-178']
i gave them to rachel before she got allergic.:::['5-13-179']
and chandler, he loves them! watch.:::['5-13-180']
he does not like it. he's in pain!:::['5-13-181']
no, he's not. yes, he is!:::['5-13-182']
what? i'm sorry but, ow!:::['5-13-183']
you've been lying to me?:::['5-13-184']
maybe he didn't want to hurt you.:::['5-13-186']
but the minute we start to lie to each other...:::['5-13-187']
and by "we"......i mean society.:::['5-13-188']
anytime you're ready.:::['5-13-189']
ahem, well, you must be new here.:::['5-13-190']
maybe we get a table, i buy you a drink.:::['5-13-191']
could you try it without the purse?:::['5-13-192']
ahem, well, you must be new here. maybe we sit...:::['5-13-194']
can i ask you something? sure. what?:::['5-13-195']
well, first, it's not a purse.:::['5-13-196']
anytime.:::['5-13-198']
if you think it's a woman's bag, it's not.:::['5-13-199']
it's a man's bag.:::['5-13-200']
okay. and go.:::['5-13-201']
let me show you the catalog.:::['5-13-202']
look. see?:::['5-13-203']
huh? it's the latest thing.:::['5-13-204']
everyone's got one. men, women, children.:::['5-13-205']
do you sell these?:::['5-13-206']
no, these babies sell themselves.:::['5-13-207']
thank you. that was great.:::['5-13-208']
but i didn't read anything.:::['5-13-209']
i think we've seen enough.:::['5-13-210']
all right, i'll see you.:::['5-13-211']
we got it. we got it.:::['5-13-212']
is rachel here? no.:::['5-13-213']
listen, i just wanted to apologize about the whole massage thing.:::['5-13-214']
i really like them.:::['5-13-215']
please stop.:::['5-13-216']
we're supposed to be honest.:::['5-13-217']
i wish you could tell me, "i don't like your massages.":::['5-13-218']
i don't like your massages.:::['5-13-219']
see? it's no big deal.:::['5-13-220']
but now you're crying.:::['5-13-221']
i'm not crying about that. i'm crying about something at work.:::['5-13-222']
my boyfriend said he didn't like my massages.:::['5-13-223']
you don't have to be best at everything.:::['5-13-224']
oh, my god! you don't know me at all!:::['5-13-225']
you give the worst massages in the world.:::['5-13-227']
i'm crying here!:::['5-13-228']
look, hear me out.:::['5-13-229']
you give the best bad massages.:::['5-13-230']
if anybody was looking for the best bad massage......and they thought, "who's the best?":::['5-13-231']
they'd have to go to you.:::['5-13-232']
so you're saying that if there was an award......for the best bad massage...:::['5-13-234']
who would get that?:::['5-13-235']
it would be you!:::['5-13-236']
you, monica! and you'd get all the votes.:::['5-13-237']
so they could call the award, "the monica"?:::['5-13-238']
i suck!:::['5-13-241']
thank you for meeting me.:::['5-13-242']
come sit.:::['5-13-244']
sit.:::['5-13-245', '4-16-273', '4-20-149']
sit!:::['5-13-246']
um, alrighty. um, before we get started, i need you......to state for the record:::['5-13-247']
that you are, in fact, frank buffay.:::['5-13-248']
yes, i am. mm-hm.:::['5-13-249']
okay. so, what did frances leave me?:::['5-13-250']
huh? that's why you wanted me to come.:::['5-13-251']
yes, she did. she left you, um......this lipstick.:::['5-13-253']
oh, it's, ew, used.:::['5-13-255']
uh, cool.:::['5-13-256']
i have just a few questions to ask, so i'll get out my official forms.:::['5-13-257']
so question one::::['5-13-258']
you were married to frances' daughter, lilly. correct?:::['5-13-259']
okay, um, question two: um, did that marriage end......a, happily......b, medium......or, c, in the total abandonment......of her and her two children?:::['5-13-261']
it really says that?:::['5-13-262']
yeah, see?:::['5-13-263']
i guess then i would have to say c.:::['5-13-264']
total abandonment.:::['5-13-265']
reasons for abandonment::::['5-13-266']
um, a, top secret government work......b, amnesia......or, c, you're just a selfish,irresponsible......bad, bad man.:::['5-13-267']
i don't want the lipstick that much.:::['5-13-268']
would you do me a favor?:::['5-13-269']
would you give lilly......that, please?:::['5-13-270']
when you see lilly, give her that note.:::['5-13-272']
i wanted to talk to her at the memorial......but i pictured her getting mad:::['5-13-273']
the way you did, and i chickened out.:::['5-13-274']
i wrote her a note. give it to her, please?:::['5-13-275']
but you came to see lilly?:::['5-13-276']
yeah. why?:::['5-13-277']
lilly's dead.:::['5-13-278']
she what?:::['5-13-279']
she's dead.:::['5-13-280']
if she isn't, cremating her was a big mistake.:::['5-13-282']
i can't believe this. i just can't believe...:::['5-13-283']
how? oh, my god.:::['5-13-284']
how long ago?:::['5-13-285']
seventeen years ago.:::['5-13-286']
what about the girls?:::['5-13-288']
well, ursula is a waitress and she lives in soho.:::['5-13-289']
and phoebe......is on this couch.:::['5-13-290']
yep, lipstick and a daughter. big day for you.:::['5-13-291']
phoebe, i, um...:::['5-13-292']
whoops.:::['5-13-293']
it's just, i don't know what to say.:::['5-13-294']
i just can't believe that you're my daughter. you're so pretty.:::['5-13-295']
yes, well, that's neither here nor there.:::['5-13-296']
would it make you feel better if i said......that i was very, very sorry i left?:::['5-13-297']
it doesn't matter what you say. it won't make a difference.:::['5-13-298']
so you can just go.:::['5-13-299']
well, you know, in my defense, i was a lousy father.:::['5-13-300']
that's your defense? yes, it is.:::['5-13-301']
i burned the formula, and i put your diapers on backwards.:::['5-13-302']
i made up a song to sing to you, but that made you cry even more.:::['5-13-303']
you make up songs?:::['5-13-304']
well, no, just that one. but it was stupid.:::['5-13-305']
let's see, how did it go? um...:::['5-13-306']
sleepy girl, sleepy girl:::['5-13-307', '5-13-309']
why won't you go to sleep?:::['5-13-308']
you're keeping me up:::['5-13-310']
i'm not very good at this.:::['5-13-311']
well, i am.:::['5-13-312']
not yet. no.:::['5-13-313']
all: hey! how'd the audition go?:::['5-13-315']
estelle said i didn't get it.:::['5-13-316']
what? why? joey, you were so ready for it.:::['5-13-317']
i thought so too......but the casting people:::['5-13-318']
had problems with me.:::['5-13-319']
what kind of problem?:::['5-13-320']
to tell you the truth......they had a problem with the bag!:::['5-13-321']
you know what? it was a stupid play anyway.:::['5-13-323']
it's time to give up the bag.:::['5-13-324']
i don't want to give up the bag.:::['5-13-325']
i don't have to give it up, do i, rach?:::['5-13-326']
you think i should give up the bag!:::['5-13-327']
joey, i'm sorry. as terrific as i think you are with it......i just don't know if the world:::['5-13-328']
is ready for you and your bag.:::['5-13-329']
wait, i'm not saying you shouldn't have a bag.:::['5-13-331']
there are other bags that are maybe a little less......controversial.:::['5-13-332']
yeah, um, they're called wallets.:::['5-13-333']
come on, joey!:::['5-12-0']
rach, i told you everything i knew last night.:::['5-12-1']
it's not that big a deal. so monica and chandler are doing it.:::['5-12-2']
i cannot believe you would say that!:::['5-12-3']
sorry. monica and chandler are "making love.":::['5-12-4']
no, i mean, come on. this is a huge deal!:::['5-12-5']
i need more details. who initiated the first kiss?:::['5-12-6']

you know what might help deal with it? think of it this way.:::['5-12-25']
you and emily are in the past. you can't be mad about the past.:::['5-12-26']
are you still mad about, you know, the louisiana purchase?:::['5-12-27']
i don't think anybody's mad about that. exactly! because it's in the past.:::['5-12-28']
anybody going to eat that?:::['5-12-29']
look at us all dressed up for the party. what are we celebrating?:::['5-12-30']
we had a lot of liquor left over from the christmas party.:::['5-12-31']
i think this is cool. none of our friends are here.:::['5-12-32']
we can be a real couple. we don't have to hide.:::['5-12-33']
i know. i can do this. ooh.:::['5-12-34']

strip church.:::['5-12-57']
i'm gonna go try to find a racket. i thought you had one.:::['5-12-58']
i used to, but then joey thought it'd be fun to go to central park and hit rocks......at bigger rocks.:::['5-12-59']
hey, rach, do you have a tennis racket? hey.:::['5-12-60']
oh, um, i lent it to joey and i've never gotten it back.:::['5-12-61']

ahem. hey. hey.:::['5-12-63']

oopsie! missed it! i got it!:::['5-12-128']
nice shot.:::['5-12-129']
i got it!:::['5-12-130']
long!:::['5-12-131']
i can't believe you let them win.:::['5-12-132']
yeah, well, at least you hid your feelings well about it.:::['5-12-133']
i was frustrated. it was my racket.:::['5-12-134']
i was frustrated with you!:::['5-12-135']
if we hadn't lost, they would never have invited us to dinner tomorrow.:::['5-12-136']
what bothers me......is how different:::['5-12-137']
you act around them.:::['5-12-138']
the throwing the tennis games, the fake laugh......the "see you later, bing!":::['5-12-139']
"not if i see you first, doug!":::['5-12-140']
i don't like "work chandler." the guy's a suck-up.:::['5-12-141']
you know what? because you said that......i'm not putting out tonight!:::['5-12-142']
something's wrong. my brother does not stay out all night.:::['5-12-143']
maybe we should check the trash chute.:::['5-12-144']
ross couldn't fit down the trash chute.:::['5-12-145']
that's right. he almost could.:::['5-12-146']
which is exactly how i got stuck there.:::['5-12-147']
rachel: hey! joey: hey.:::['5-12-148']
where the hell have you been?:::['5-12-150']
just, you know, out.:::['5-12-151']
oh, out! god, i don't know why we didn't think to check there.:::['5-12-152']
what were you doing?:::['5-12-153']
i, uh, went to a bar and then......i just, uh, walked around for a while.:::['5-12-154']
you walked around all night in the city by yourself?:::['5-12-155']
he hooked up!:::['5-12-156', '5-12-160']
he hooked up with someone.:::['5-12-157']
i don't have to answer your questions. okay? i'm a big boy.:::['5-12-158']
i can do whatever i want.:::['5-12-159']
tell us about her!:::['5-12-161']
ross, you left your scarf...:::['5-12-162']
i know what you all are thinking, but chandler is in yemen.:::['5-12-165']
i'm a young woman. i have needs. i can't wait forever.:::['5-12-166']
yeah, no, that's what i was thinking.:::['5-12-167']
so i'm asking you, please just take a moment before you judge me.:::['5-12-168']
oh, nobody's judging you.:::['5-12-169']
okay, you, mr. right-place-at-the-right-time......call me.:::['5-12-171']
okay, look, i know what you guys are going to say.:::['5-12-172']
you two would have very hairy children.:::['5-12-173']
i didn't know you'd say that.:::['5-12-174']
ross! janice?:::['5-12-175']
all right. hold on, hold on, hold on.:::['5-12-176']
this is ross. okay?:::['5-12-177']
he's our friend. he obviously went crazy.:::['5-12-178']
he obviously lost his mind.:::['5-12-179']
i didn't lose my mind, okay? janice and i have a lot in common.:::['5-12-180']
we've both been divorced. we both have kids.:::['5-12-181']
are you going to see her again?:::['5-12-182']
don't put ideas in his head! i am gonna see her again.:::['5-12-183']
damn it, phoebe!:::['5-12-184']
i have to tell you something that i've never admitted.:::['5-12-185']
in high school, i made out with james even though i knew that you liked him.:::['5-12-186']
wow! that feels so good to get off my chest. okay, you go.:::['5-12-187']
my turn? what are you talking about? ugh.:::['5-12-188']
monica...:::['5-12-189']
i know about you and chandler.:::['5-12-190']
i overheard you on the phone the other day.:::['5-12-192']
you said, "i'll tell rachel i'm doing laundry for a couple of hours.":::['5-12-193']
and he said, "laundry? is that my new nickname?":::['5-12-194']
and you said, "no.:::['5-12-195']
you know what your nickname is, mr. big.":::['5-12-196']
well, heh...:::['5-12-197']
sounds like you're writing yourself a little play there, rach.:::['5-12-198']
wow, i... let me know how that one turns out.:::['5-12-199']
i wouldn't know because i got so freaked out i hung up the phone.:::['5-12-200']
well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha......you would have heard me:::['5-12-201']
call him mister big......ot.:::['5-12-202']
mr. bigot.:::['5-12-204']
ha, ha. he tells the most racist jokes.:::['5-12-205']
all right. so that's it.:::['5-12-206']
you're telling me there's nothing going on between you and chandler?:::['5-12-207']
me and chandler?:::['5-12-208']
put your $20 down. okay.:::['5-12-209']
first one to find the tasty treat wins.:::['5-12-210']
okay? all right. mm-hm.:::['5-12-211']
and they're off!:::['5-12-213']
get your foot off my contestant! judge?:::['5-12-215']
judge rules no violation.:::['5-12-216']
hey, guys. yeah.:::['5-12-218']
it's so weird to say this, but i just had a great date with janice.:::['5-12-219']
yeah. i opened up to her about all the terrible stuff that's been happening to me.:::['5-12-221']
i mean, i talked for hours.:::['5-12-222']
it is amazing......to have someone give you:::['5-12-223']
such focused attention.:::['5-12-224']
you don't need janice for that. you've got us.:::['5-12-225']
and the duck gets the nutter butter! no! agh!:::['5-12-226']
that's not a nutter butter. that's an old won ton!:::['5-12-227']
judge rules......nutter butter.:::['5-12-228']
tough call. yeah.:::['5-12-230']
seriously, i strongly believe that we should all support president clinton......and her husband, bill.:::['5-12-231']
so how do you like your coffee?:::['5-12-232']
none for me. just a little bit of sugar.:::['5-12-233']
i'll have monica stick her finger in it.:::['5-12-234']
that ought to sweeten it up.:::['5-12-235']
how does that not give you a headache? you get used to it.:::['5-12-236']
i don't think that i can.:::['5-12-237']
maybe this will be it for me on the work things.:::['5-12-238']
so i laugh at my boss's jokes. what's the big deal?:::['5-12-239']
i'd rather not hang out with this work-weasel guy......when i could be with my boyfriend,who i actually respect.:::['5-12-240']
ah, heh.:::['5-12-242']
i gotta apologize for kara's coffee.:::['5-12-243']
i'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.:::['5-12-244']
it's not strong enough to defend itself. ha-ha-ha!:::['5-12-245']
hear what i said?:::['5-12-246']
it's a joke, bing. what's the matter with you?:::['5-12-248']
well, i just didn't think it was funny, sir.:::['5-12-249']
well, i just... honey?:::['5-12-251']
i just don't think you understood the joke.:::['5-12-252']
i mean, it was really funny. i just don't think that you got it.:::['5-12-254']
heh, you see, kara's coffee is weak-tasting.:::['5-12-255']
but what doug did was imply that it was weak physically.:::['5-12-256']
you get it now, honey? i think i do!:::['5-12-257']
thank you, monica. i thought you could use the help.:::['5-12-258']
coffee in a fight!:::['5-12-260']
you mind if i read my comic books in here?:::['5-12-262']
sure. why?:::['5-12-263']
chandler and monica are over there. it's kind of hard to concentrate.:::['5-12-264']
what? she just called and said she was going to be working late.:::['5-12-265']
she keeps lying to me.:::['5-12-266']
that's it! i'm gonna go over there and i'm confronting them right now.:::['5-12-267']
chandler: so you're telling me that i have to tell racist jokes now?:::['5-12-268']
monica: i'm just not very good at this.:::['5-12-269']
i'm a terrible liar. i hate having to lie to rachel.:::['5-12-270']
but we're not ready to tell yet. i know.:::['5-12-271']
ever since high school, rachel was the one person that i told everything to.:::['5-12-272']
i miss that so much now.:::['5-12-273']
she's my best friend.:::['5-12-274']
monica: joey?:::['5-12-275']
oh, my god, rachel! hey!:::['5-12-276']
well, i actually came over here to borrow this lamp......to, um, look at my books.:::['5-12-279']
you know, see them a little better. heh.:::['5-12-280']
okay, great. great. um... yeah.:::['5-12-281']
well, what i was doing in chandler's room is that, um......i was cleaning it.:::['5-12-282']
in fact, he pays me to clean it. oh!:::['5-12-283']
what a great way to make some extra pocket money.:::['5-12-284']
when i said to you earlier that i was at work, um......i'm at my new work.:::['5-12-285']
good enough. right?:::['5-12-286']
okay, well, um...:::['5-12-287']
i'm gonna go look at my books.:::['5-12-288']
okay. go get back to my new job. okay.:::['5-12-289']
congratulations on your new job!:::['5-12-291']
man, she is really gullible.:::['5-12-292']
actually, i should get going. you're sure?:::['5-12-294']
i can stay out as late as you want.:::['5-12-295']
i told you i'm on sabbatical from work...:::['5-12-296']
yes, yes. you did. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-12-297']
oh, man! what is wrong now?:::['5-12-298']
this isn't what i ordered.:::['5-12-299']
man! can't anything go right in my life?:::['5-12-300']
first, my marriage falls apart, and then...:::['5-12-301']
i know, i know!:::['5-12-302', '4-10-245']
you lose your apartment, then you lose your job......then your ex-wife gets married so fast!:::['5-12-303']
and now the coffee!:::['5-12-304']
ross......we need to talk.:::['5-12-306']
sometimes i feel... no, no, don't.:::['5-12-308']
i'm going to talk.:::['5-12-309']
i believe......that the sun has set......on our day in the sun.:::['5-12-310']
what? you're a very sweet person, ross.:::['5-12-311']
unfortunately......i just don't think i can take:::['5-12-313']
another second of you whining!:::['5-12-314']
let me make sure i'm hearing this right.:::['5-12-315']
you're ending this with me because......i'm too whiny?:::['5-12-316']
so you're saying......i've become so whiny......that i......annoy you......janice.:::['5-12-318']
well, yeah!:::['5-12-319']
are you gonna be okay? i am now.:::['5-12-321']
hi. oh, hi.:::['5-12-323']
i guess, that's two out of three......joey!:::['5-12-325']
dude, we gotta talk. okay.:::['5-12-326']
i want to tell you something before you heard it from someone else.:::['5-12-327']
i hope this isn't too weird but, uh......i had a thing with janice.:::['5-12-328']
you're not mad?:::['5-12-329']
why would i be mad?:::['5-12-330']
because there's certain rules about this kind of stuff.:::['5-12-331']
you don't, uh... you don't fool around with your friends' ex-girlfriends......or, uh......possible girlfriends:::['5-12-332']
or girls they're related to.:::['5-12-333']
i am mad.:::['5-12-334']
but you know what i'm gonna do? i'm gonna forgive you.:::['5-12-335']
because that's what friends do.:::['5-12-336']
they forgive their friends when they do everything you just said.:::['5-12-337']
all the things on the list there. thank you.:::['5-12-338']
but i want you to remember......that i forgave you.:::['5-12-339']
okay. i also want you to remember......that i let you live here rent-free.:::['5-12-340']
all right. and i want you to remember......that i gave you 27 dollars.:::['5-12-341']
no strings attached!:::['5-12-342']
if you can't remember that......i think we should write it down.:::['5-12-343']
let's write it down!:::['5-12-344']
what are you guys doing up? we wanted to finish the crossword before bed.:::['5-16-1']
do you know a six-letter word for "red"?:::['5-16-2']
dark-red.:::['5-16-3']
i think that's wrong, but there's a connect-the-dots in here for you later.:::['5-16-4']
hey, how, uh, about maroon?:::['5-16-5']
yes! you are so smart! ha-ha-ha.:::['5-16-6']
joey: aw.:::['5-16-7']
you guys are so cute.:::['5-16-8']
all right. i'll see you in the morning.:::['5-16-10']
you know, i love doing crossword puzzles with you, honey.:::['5-16-12']
now, let's finish this and go to bed. okay.:::['5-16-14']
there's only one left.:::['5-16-15']
three-letter word. not dog, but...:::['5-16-16']
cat.:::['5-16-17']
yes. ha.:::['5-16-18']
you are so smart!:::['5-16-19']
rachel: uh.:::['5-16-22']
we still need a tip.:::['5-16-23']
all right. hold on.:::['5-16-24']
nickel.:::['5-16-26']
how much more do we need? couple of bucks.:::['5-16-27']
okay, dime.:::['5-16-28']
you guys should probably keep talking. this could take a while.:::['5-16-29']
wait, lookit!:::['5-16-30']
oh, my god. this is a police badge!:::['5-16-32']
oh, cool. but why would a cop come in here? they don't serve doughnuts. ha.:::['5-16-33']
can you discover the badge again?:::['5-16-34']
i think i can come up with something better than that.:::['5-16-35']
i bet somebody's missing that badge.:::['5-16-36']
i should take it back. ooh, but while i'm at the police station......i could check their:::['5-16-37']
ten most wanted list.:::['5-16-38']
my friend fritzi's been number 11 forever. this could be her year!:::['5-16-39']
hey, you guys. monica: hey, joey.:::['5-16-40']
is that my sweatshirt?:::['5-16-42']
yes, it is. i'm sorry. i borrowed it. i was cold. i hope it's okay.:::['5-16-43']
it's just that, uh, if you wear someone's sweatshirt......shouldn't it be your boyfriend's?:::['5-16-44']
and i'm not him.:::['5-16-45']
i'm sorry. i'll give it back.:::['5-16-46']
it's going to be all smelling like monica.:::['5-16-48']
are you saying i smell bad?:::['5-16-49']
you smell like a meadow.:::['5-16-51']
what's with him?:::['5-16-53']
the last time joey went to a meadow, his mother was shot by a hunter.:::['5-16-54']
i still don't know.:::['5-16-55']
i'm sorry, i just want to make sure i bought the right couch, one that says::::['5-16-56']
"kids welcome here," but that also says:::['5-16-57']
"come here to me.":::['5-16-58']
what? you say that to kids?:::['5-16-59']
the "come here to me" is, you know, for the ladies.:::['5-16-61']
ross, honey, it's a nice couch, not a magic couch.:::['5-16-62']
well, you picked a great couch.:::['5-16-63']
sign here please. sure.:::['5-16-65']
oh, what's, heh...?:::['5-16-66']
the delivery charge is almost as much as the couch!:::['5-16-67']
that's ridiculous. he lives three blocks away.:::['5-16-68']
you know what? i'll take it myself. thank you.:::['5-16-69']
all right, rach, come on. let's go.:::['5-16-70']
come on. it's only three blocks. uh, it's not very heavy. try it.:::['5-16-73']
oh, i can do it. yeah.:::['5-16-74']
you two will really enjoy that couch.:::['5-16-75']
we're, uh, not together.:::['5-16-76']
oh, okay. yeah. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-16-77']
something didn't quite add up there.:::['5-16-78']
what's that supposed to mean? ross.:::['5-16-80']
well, you. her. heh.:::['5-16-81']
i mean, she's very......you know.:::['5-16-82']
and you're, like......you know?:::['5-16-83']
not that it's any of your business, but we did go out.:::['5-16-84']
really? you two?:::['5-16-85']
yeah. rach?:::['5-16-86']
i don't want to do this now. i'm carrying a heavy couch.:::['5-16-87']
then tell him quickly.:::['5-16-88']
fine. we went out.:::['5-16-89']
not only did we go out......we did it 298 times!:::['5-16-90']
ugh, you kept count? you are such a loser!:::['5-16-93']
a loser you did it with 298 times!:::['5-16-94']
oh. oh!:::['5-16-95', '4-21-86']
excuse me, ma'am. you can't put your cigarette out on a tree.:::['5-16-96']
yeah, i can. it worked well.:::['5-16-97']
but you shouldn't. so don't ever do that again.:::['5-16-98']
i won't till i have my next cigarette.:::['5-16-99']
hold it!:::['5-16-100']
nypd. freeze, punk!:::['5-16-101']
that's right. you are so busted.:::['5-16-103']
book them.:::['5-16-104']
who are you talking to? save it, red!:::['5-16-105']
unless you want to spend the night in the slammer, you apologize to the tree.:::['5-16-106']
i am not going to apologize to a tree.:::['5-16-107']
you apologize to the tree right now, or i am calling for backup.:::['5-16-108']
backup! backup!:::['5-16-109']
i'm sorry! sorry!:::['5-16-110']
okay, cancel backup! cancel backup!:::['5-16-111']
ross: okay.:::['5-16-112']
didn't you say there was, um, an elevator in here?:::['5-16-113']
uh, yes, i did, but there isn't. here we go!:::['5-16-114']
okay, go left.:::['5-16-115']
left. left.:::['5-16-116']
okay, you know what? there's no more left left.:::['5-16-117']
lift it straight up over your head.:::['5-16-118']
straight up over your head. you can do it!:::['5-16-119']
you can do it!:::['5-16-120']
okay. you got it? yeah.:::['5-16-121']
go, go. good, good.:::['5-16-122']
you got it, right? you got it, right? you got...:::['5-16-123']
any chance you think the couch looks good there?:::['5-16-124']
this guy was all...:::['5-16-125']
and i'm all, "buffay! homicide!":::['5-16-126']
it was just so cool! ha-ha-ha.:::['5-16-127']
phoebe, you were supposed to take that back.:::['5-16-128']
i know, but i'm having so much fun doing good deeds.:::['5-16-129']
okay, but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing. you can get arrested.:::['5-16-130']
you could get arrested right now!:::['5-16-131']
all right, yeah, i'd better take it back. i'm totally drunk with power.:::['5-16-132']
hi, joe.:::['5-16-135']
yeah. i didn't know you guys were gonna be here.:::['5-16-136']
do me a favor, sweetie. taste this. what? why?:::['5-16-137']
what is going on with you? nothing.:::['5-16-138']
you've been acting strange all day.:::['5-16-139']
all right. there is something. i, uh...:::['5-16-140']
i kind of had a dream.:::['5-16-141']
but i don't want to talk about it.:::['5-16-142']
oh, whoa. what if martin luther king had said that?:::['5-16-143']
i kind of have a dream.:::['5-16-144']
look, it involved monica.:::['5-16-146']
you had a dream about a girl i'm seeing? oh, that is so cool.:::['5-16-147']
i can't tell you how many times i dreamt about a girl he was seeing.:::['5-16-148']
anyway, we were talking about your dream. i love you. your dream?:::['5-16-149']
don't worry, there wasn't any sex in it. i haven't dreamt about her like that......since i found out:::['5-16-150']
about you two-ish.:::['5-16-151']
what was the dream about?:::['5-16-152']
you were my girlfriend. we were doing the crossword puzzle.:::['5-16-154']
like you guys were doing last night.:::['5-16-155']
so that's it. i'm in love with monica and i'll be moving out.:::['5-16-156']
joey, come on. that doesn't mean that you're in love with me.:::['5-16-157']
it doesn't?:::['5-16-158']
it could mean anything. like, uh......all of a sudden you're jealous:::['5-16-159']
that i've become the apartment stud.:::['5-16-160']
kind of sounds like your dream, dude.:::['5-16-161']
or it could mean you saw chandler and me together, being close and stuff......and you just wanna have that:::['5-16-162']
with someone too.:::['5-16-163']
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness.:::['5-16-164']
are you attracted to monica?:::['5-16-166']
right here, right now, are you attracted to her?:::['5-16-167']
not really. there you have it!:::['5-16-168']
heh. well, sure! i'm just wearing sweats!:::['5-16-169']
but that's good!:::['5-16-170']
you're not in love with me. you just want a girlfriend.:::['5-16-171']
no, i don't think it's just about getting a girlfriend.:::['5-16-172']
yeah, i could get a girlfriend.:::['5-16-173']
yeah, we could sit in the chair and do crossword puzzles.:::['5-16-174']
but are we ever gonna have the closeness like you guys have?:::['5-16-175']
monica and i were friends before we started dating. maybe that's it.:::['5-16-176']
friends first?:::['5-16-177']
you become friends after? no, never done that either.:::['5-16-179']
um, do you guys have a tape measure?:::['5-16-180']
oh, yeah. it's actually in my bedroom.:::['5-16-181']
what's up, joey?:::['5-16-183']
phoebe: excuse me. is this your car? yeah.:::['5-16-185']
well, i don't think it's nice of you to park here. you're blocking the entrance.:::['5-16-186']
don't worry about it. it's not a problem.:::['5-16-187']
it's a problem for me, which means it's a problem for you because i'm a cop.:::['5-16-188']
so am i.:::['5-16-189']
oh, okay. so you're a cop. you can park anywhere.:::['5-16-191']
i know that because i'm a cop too.:::['5-16-192']
all right. keep up the good work. ten-four.:::['5-16-193']
wait a second. so, what precinct are you with?:::['5-16-194']
i'm with the, um, the 57th.:::['5-16-195']
i know a guy in homicide up there. i'm in vice.:::['5-16-196']
in fact, i'm undercover right now. i'm a whore.:::['5-16-197']
who else is in vice up there?:::['5-16-198']
um, do you know, um......sipowitz?:::['5-16-199']
sipowitz? no, i don't think so.:::['5-16-200']
yeah. sipowitz. yeah. big guy, kind of bald.:::['5-16-201']
i don't know him.:::['5-16-202']
don't try to call him or anything. because he's not there. he's out.:::['5-16-203']
his, um, partner just died.:::['5-16-204']
tell sipowitz i'm real sorry for his loss.:::['5-16-205']
i sure will. take care.:::['5-16-206']
hey, by the way, i'm sure sipowitz is gonna be all right.:::['5-16-207']
i heard that kid from silver spoons is really good.:::['5-16-208']
where'd you find my badge?:::['5-16-209']
hey, joey, would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch?:::['5-16-211']
aw, i'd love to but i got acting class. but you know what?:::['5-16-212']
i guess i could blow that off for you.:::['5-16-213']
uh, let me ask you something. i was talking with monica and chandler.:::['5-16-215']
boy, they are really tight.:::['5-16-216']
that's not a bad situation they got over there.:::['5-16-218']
thinking of getting me one of those.:::['5-16-220']
the reason i think monica and chandler are so great......is because they were friends first,you know?:::['5-16-222']
so i asked myself, who are my friends? you and phoebe.:::['5-16-223']
i saw you first, so...:::['5-16-224']
rachel: heh. mm-hm.:::['5-16-225']
what are you saying? i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch.:::['5-16-226']
you know, honey, um......as, uh, flattered as i am......that you saw me first......uh, i just don't think we should be:::['5-16-227']
cranking anything up.:::['5-16-228']
i'll treat you real nice.:::['5-16-229']
yeah. well, you know, um...:::['5-16-231']
listen, i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date.:::['5-16-232']
but i think the way you do it is you meet someone, become their friend......build a foundation,then ask them out on a date.:::['5-16-233']
don't hit on your existing friends.:::['5-16-234']
won't that take longer?:::['5-16-235']
oh, but once you find it......it's so worth the wait.:::['5-16-237']
rachel: good.:::['5-16-240']
man, i wish i saw phoebe first.:::['5-16-241']
come here to me.:::['5-16-242']
no, no. you come here to me.:::['5-16-243']
ahem, i brought reinforcements. oh, great! you brought joey?:::['5-16-245']
i brought the next best thing. heh.:::['5-16-246']
you brought chandler? the next best thing would be monica!:::['5-16-248']
i would be offended, but monica is freakishly strong, so...:::['5-16-249']
look, i drew a sketch of how we'll do it.:::['5-16-250']
rach, that's you.:::['5-16-251']
that's the couch.:::['5-16-252']
oh, what's that?:::['5-16-253']
certainly think a lot of yourself.:::['5-16-256']
no. that's my arm.:::['5-16-257']
oh, i see. i thought you just really, really liked your new couch.:::['5-16-258']
just follow my lead.:::['5-16-259']
ross: come on, chandler.:::['5-16-261']
all right. chandler: okay.:::['5-16-263']
ross: here we go.:::['5-16-264']
all right. ready?:::['5-16-265']
chandler: yeah. rachel: yeah.:::['5-16-266']
ross: turn! chandler: okay.:::['5-16-267']
ross: turn!:::['5-16-268']
turn!:::['5-16-269']
i don't think we can turn anymore! rachel: i don't think it'll fit!:::['5-16-270']
ross: yeah, it will. come on! up, up, up!:::['5-16-271']
up! yes!:::['5-16-272']
here we go! pivot!:::['5-16-273']
pivot!:::['5-16-274']
shut up! shut up! shut up!:::['5-16-275']
i don't think it's gonna pivot anymore.:::['5-16-276']
both: you think?:::['5-16-277']
all right, let's, uh, bring it back down and try again.:::['5-16-278']
rachel: whoa.:::['5-16-280']
i think it's really stuck now.:::['5-16-281']
i can't believe that didn't work. i know. me neither.:::['5-16-282']
i mean, you had a sketch.:::['5-16-283']
what did you mean when you said "pivot"?:::['5-16-284']
how's it going? did you make any new friends?:::['5-16-286']
yeah. i met this woman.:::['5-16-287']
hey. whoa, whoa.:::['5-16-288']
what's she like?:::['5-16-289']
uh, well, she's......really good in bed.:::['5-16-290']
i thought you were going to try to be friends first.:::['5-16-291']
hey, it's all your fault. what? why?:::['5-16-292']
you didn't give me advice. you gave me a pickup line.:::['5-16-293']
i told her i wanted to "build a foundation and be friends.":::['5-16-294']
suddenly, through no fault of my own, i became irresistible to her!:::['5-16-295']
and her roommate!:::['5-16-296']
what about the "closeness"?:::['5-16-297']
closeness, schmosness! there was three of us, for crying out loud!:::['5-16-298']
who wants pizza?:::['5-16-299']
i do! i do! i do!:::['5-16-300', '4-24-13']
this is great! can you believe i found this on the second floor?:::['5-16-301']
who is it? officer: nypd.:::['5-16-302']
phoebe: oh, my god! joey: oh, my god.:::['5-16-303']
uh, just a minute, officer!:::['5-16-304']
officer: i'm looking for phoebe buffay. my god, it's him! it's that cop!:::['5-16-305']
i can't believe he found me! are you going to go to jail?:::['5-16-306']
if i'm going down, you guys are going down with me.:::['5-16-307']
harboring a fugitive? that's one-to-three years minimum.:::['5-16-308']
you can arrest me, but you'll never make it stick and you know it.:::['5-16-310']
i kind of don't have a choice, it's my job. you understand, right?:::['5-16-311']
yeah, as long as you understand that i'm gonna call my lawyer.:::['5-16-312']
and once he puts you on the stand, he's gonna make you look like a fool! like a fool!:::['5-16-313']
i don't like looking foolish.:::['5-16-314']
maybe, uh, i don't arrest you today. maybe i came by and you weren't here.:::['5-16-315']
i would love it if i weren't here!:::['5-16-316']
since, um, you're not going to jail tonight, i was wondering if you'd, um......like to go to dinner with me?:::['5-16-317']
me? officer: yeah.:::['5-16-318']
ever since you flashed my badge at me, i kind of can't stop thinking about you.:::['5-16-319']
you're the prettiest fake undercover whore i've ever seen.:::['5-16-320']
wow, i didn't see that coming. you're asking me out.:::['5-16-322']
yeah, i could've done it better, but these people keep staring at me.:::['5-16-323']
um, yeah, i'd like to go out with you, officer.:::['5-16-324']
gary. gary.:::['5-16-325']
okay, so it's a date. phoebe: yeah.:::['5-16-326']
i gotta ask you, though. how did you know where to find me?:::['5-16-327']
your fingerprints were all over my badge so i ran them through the computer.:::['5-16-328']
this was listed as your last known address so i checked it out.:::['5-16-329']
oh, impressive.:::['5-16-330']
not as impressive as you. i looked at your record and you've done some weird stuff.:::['5-16-331']
we'll talk at dinner.:::['5-16-332']
so i'll come by in a couple hours and pick you up?:::['5-16-334']
all right, i can't wait. okay.:::['5-16-335']
don't worry, i won't just take you out for doughnuts.:::['5-16-336']
he has a gun!:::['5-16-337']
i'd like to return this couch. i'm not satisfied with it.:::['5-16-338']
you want to return this couch?:::['5-16-339']
it's cut in half.:::['5-16-340']
that's what i'm telling you. did you cut this couch in half?:::['5-16-341']
this couch is cut in half!:::['5-16-342']
i would like to exchange it for one that is not cut in half.:::['5-16-343']
you're telling me this couch was delivered to you like this?:::['5-16-344']
look, i'm a reasonable man.:::['5-16-345']
i will accept store credit.:::['5-16-346']
i'll give you store credit in the amount of $4.:::['5-16-347']
i will take it.:::['5-16-348']
good! you guys are all here. hey, what's up?:::['5-17-0']
well, i have a job interview at ralph lauren tomorrow.:::['5-17-1']
chandler: oh! congratulations!:::['5-17-2']
oh, boy. that guy's underwear sucks!:::['5-17-3']
what? well, i got this pair marked "xs.":::['5-17-4']
let me tell you, there was no room for excess anything in there.:::['5-17-5']
anyway, i'm gonna be the coordinator of the women's collection.:::['5-17-6']
i'll work right under the director. it's the perfect job for me.:::['5-17-7']
wow. well, if you nail the interview, you'll get it.:::['5-17-8']
yeah. want to work on your interview skills?:::['5-17-9']
okay! okay! let's start with the handshake.:::['5-17-10']
very good handshake. good wrist action.:::['5-17-12']
thank you. let me try.:::['5-17-13']
phoebe: okay.:::['5-17-14']
oh, my god! what did i ever do to you?:::['5-17-15']
did i squeeze too hard?:::['5-17-16']
let's just say i'm glad i'm not chandler.:::['5-17-17']
that's right, ross. i can see you in your new apartment. you see me.:::['5-17-18']
same as yesterday, same as the day before.:::['5-17-19']
is he doing his "shark attack" bit yet?:::['5-17-20']
no. oh, wait! there he goes.:::['5-17-21']
very funny, ross.:::['5-17-22']
very lifelike and funny. okay.:::['5-17-23']
oh, no, no, no. i wasn't waving at you, lady.:::['5-17-24']
whoa, maybe i was. hey!:::['5-17-25']
monica, this hot girl in ross' building is flirting with me.:::['5-17-26']
get in there, man. flirt back. mix it up!:::['5-17-27']
yeah, i'm down with that.:::['5-17-28']
okay, here it goes.:::['5-17-29']
how......you......doing?:::['5-17-30']
it worked! she's waving me over. i'll be right over.:::['5-17-31']
let's see, she's on the third floor...:::['5-17-32']
she is pretty, huh? tell me about it, huh?:::['5-17-34']
no, no! i'm not with her.:::['5-17-36']
oh, that's just monica.:::['5-17-37']
blah!:::['5-17-38']
ross: hey, joey!:::['5-17-39']
great stuff, huh?:::['5-17-40']
this is your place? yeah, of course it is. oh, come on in.:::['5-17-41']
ooh, ohh. uh, go by the window. you can pretend to be surfing.:::['5-17-42']
but i counted. you're not supposed to live here.:::['5-17-43']
unh! what happened?:::['5-17-45']
i ended up at ross' place. i must have miscounted or something.:::['5-17-46']
damn! she's not there anymore.:::['5-17-47']
oh, look, ross is doing his "watching tv" bit.:::['5-17-48']
monica: no, joe, i think he's just watching tv.:::['5-17-49']
we've lost visual contact with the suspect.:::['5-17-50']
okay, now i really have to go.:::['5-17-51']
it's so unfair that our date has to get cut short......just because some guy:::['5-17-52']
shot at a store clerk.:::['5-17-53']
i know, but it's my job. then maybe i could come too?:::['5-17-54']
just emerged naked from the sewer.:::['5-17-55']
all right, you go.:::['5-17-56']
bye-bye. okay. bye.:::['5-17-57']
oh, i just miss him so much!:::['5-17-59']
for just a week, you guys are close, huh?:::['5-17-61']
yeah, it's weird. i can't help it, though. he's so sweet.:::['5-17-62']
he's like this little puppy dog, you know?:::['5-17-63']
but like a really tough one who shoots bad guys.:::['5-17-64']
ugh, i love the beginning parts of relationships, you know?:::['5-17-65']
you can't keep your hands off each other.:::['5-17-66']
i know. it is the best. ha, ha. ha, ha.:::['5-17-67']
god, how long did that last for you and chandler?:::['5-17-68']
what? it's still going on.:::['5-17-69']
come on, seriously. when did it end?:::['5-17-70']
i am serious. we're all over each other all the time.:::['5-17-71']
okay, you know where you are better than i do. i was just curious.:::['5-17-72']
why don't you just calm down, phoebe, all right?:::['5-17-73']
get all your facts before you tell everybody you're the only hot couple.:::['5-17-74']
god, i woke the beast. um...:::['5-17-75']
i was wrong obviously. i just misspoke. it's okay.:::['5-17-76']
well, it is okay. i mean...:::['5-17-77']
as long as you know chandler and i are also hot and fiery.:::['5-17-78']
i mean, just as hot as you.:::['5-17-79']
i mean, our flame...:::['5-17-80']
whoo! it is on fire!:::['5-17-81']
monica, here's your broom back.:::['5-17-82']
you are so cute.:::['5-17-83']
oh, hey! how'd the interview go? rachel: ugh!:::['5-17-84']
horrible! i did the stupidest, most embarrassing thing.:::['5-17-85']
did you tell the guy you wanted to have sex with his wife then fall off your chair?:::['5-17-86']
no. so, what happened?:::['5-17-87']
ugh, it was horrible! and the interview part went so well.:::['5-17-88']
you know, like, i even made him laugh. he said something about a boat......and i was like, "well, yeah,if you've got enough life jackets.":::['5-17-89']
trust me. it was actually very funny.:::['5-17-90']
anyway, so we were saying goodbye and, uh... ugh.:::['5-17-91']
what happened? all right, we were shaking hands......and he kind of leaned in toward me.:::['5-17-92']
maybe he was going to open the door.:::['5-17-93']
but i totally misread him and i, uh...:::['5-17-94']
you kissed him?:::['5-17-95']
i didn't know what else to do!:::['5-17-96']
well, you could have tried......not kissing him.:::['5-17-97']
thanks, chandler.:::['5-17-98']
hey, rach, a guy from ralph lauren called.:::['5-17-99']
you got a second interview.:::['5-17-100']
i can't believe it! i got a second interview. yes!:::['5-17-101']
that kiss isn't looking like such a mistake now, is it?:::['5-17-102']
wait a minute, wait. you don't think that's why he wants me back?:::['5-17-103']
kiss? what are you talking about?:::['5-17-106']
ugh, i accidentally kissed him in the interview......and now he wants me back of course......because, "let's bring back:::['5-17-107']
the girl who kisses everybody"!:::['5-17-108']
come on, rach.:::['5-17-109']
what if he thinks i'm the kind of girl that'll just sleep with him?:::['5-17-110']
he wants you back because you're right for the job.:::['5-17-111']
maybe. i don't know. oh, god! how could i be so stupid?:::['5-17-112']
oh, rachel, look, don't say that.:::['5-17-113']
i think you just need a hug from joey. heh.:::['5-17-114']
come on. come on, ha-ha-ha.:::['5-17-115']
she's back! hot girl's back!:::['5-17-116']
aw, well, i'm not totally back yet. but i appreciate it.:::['5-17-117']
no, in ross' building. she's back! she's back!:::['5-17-118']
okay, wait there. i'll be over in a second.:::['5-17-119']
one, two, three. got it!:::['5-17-120']
i gotta check out this hot girl.:::['5-17-121']
damn it! did you move?:::['5-17-123']
i lived with you for a while. then i found this place.:::['5-17-125']
do you happen to have a hot girl in there?:::['5-17-129']
no, i'm all alone.:::['5-17-130']
yeah. sorry about that.:::['5-17-131']
oh. hey, little girl.:::['5-17-132']
is your mommy or sister or babysitter by any chance, a hot girl?:::['5-17-133']
daddy! later, girl! aah.:::['5-17-134']
hot girl?:::['5-17-136']
hot girl!:::['5-17-137']
hi, rachel. come on in. hi. okay.:::['5-17-138']
ahem. it's nice to see you again.:::['5-17-139']
oh, rachel, uh...:::['5-17-141']
what? just, uh...:::['5-17-142']
excuse me? yeah, let me...:::['5-17-143']
whoa, eh, oh!:::['5-17-144']
all right. okay, i see what's going on here. now, listen, look......i am sorry if i gave you:::['5-17-145']
the wrong impression.:::['5-17-146']
but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead.:::['5-17-147']
now... eh, eh! well...:::['5-17-148']
even though i kissed you, that does not give you......the right to demand sex from me!:::['5-17-149']
i do not want this job that bad.:::['5-17-150']
good day, sir.:::['5-17-151']
ugh, you are not gonna believe......what that sleazeball:::['5-17-152']
from ralph lauren did to me.:::['5-17-153']
okay, that's amazing. how did you know that?:::['5-17-154']
you got ink on your lip.:::['5-17-155']
what do you say, maybe, sometime i hold your gun?:::['5-17-157']
i don't know. we're not supposed to do that.:::['5-17-158']
what could happen? i mean...:::['5-17-159']
yeah. i'm gonna say no.:::['5-17-160']
do you want to see a movie after dinner tonight?:::['5-17-161']
oh, we can't. we already have plans.:::['5-17-162']
um, well, same thing we did all day. just hang out at gary's apartment.:::['5-17-164']
he is so amazing. we never left the bedroom.:::['5-17-165']
but have fun at the movie.:::['5-17-166']
uh, ha, ha. well, we're not seeing a movie.:::['5-17-167']
you're not? why did you ask us if we wanted to go?:::['5-17-168']
oh, um, because i just wanted to know what you were doing......so you wouldn't walk in:::['5-17-169']
on me and chandler......while we were doing it all night.:::['5-17-170']
will you excuse me just a second? okay. yeah.:::['5-17-171']
chandler? can i see you for a second?:::['5-17-172']
uh, yeah. okay, heh.:::['5-17-173']
we have got to beat them! why?:::['5-17-174']
because gary and phoebe think they're a hotter couple than we are.:::['5-17-175']
oh! so? so?:::['5-17-176']
so we've gotta go have a lot of sex and prove them wrong!:::['5-17-177']
you have got to stop this competitive thing. it's crazy.:::['5-17-178']
just to impress gary and phoebe......you want me to go upstairs:::['5-17-179']
and have sex over and over......and i'm saying no to this why?:::['5-17-180']
get your coat!:::['5-17-181']
man: excuse me.:::['5-17-183']
you should check this out. tell the other tenants.:::['5-17-184']
apparently, he's running around looking for some kind of hot girl.:::['5-17-185']
who isn't?:::['5-17-186']
i don't think we've met. i'm ross.:::['5-17-187']
i know. you're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.:::['5-17-188']
no, i actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted.:::['5-17-190']
i mean, you had just moved in.:::['5-17-191']
i had just moved in!:::['5-17-192']
jen. jen.:::['5-17-195']
i know this may sound a little::::['5-17-196']
but, uh, would you want to grab a cup of coffee sometime?:::['5-17-197']
sure, that would be nice.:::['5-17-198']
um... oh.:::['5-17-199']
my number's on there. give me a call.:::['5-17-200']
i will give you a call. heh.:::['5-17-201']
i'll see you later. okay.:::['5-17-202']
i forgot my paper.:::['5-17-203']
that was amazing. ugh.:::['5-17-204']
phoebe and gary are so gonna hear about this at dinner.:::['5-17-205']
we are the hottest, huh?:::['5-17-207']
no one is hotter than we are.:::['5-17-208']
we're the best. no, you're the best.:::['5-17-209']
no, you're the best. no, you're the best.:::['5-17-211']
i am the best.:::['5-17-212']
what you been doing?:::['5-17-214']
hey, joey, isn't that the girl who waved at you the other day?:::['5-17-215']
i don't know, but i can see through your sheet.:::['5-17-216']
yeah. yeah, that's her. but you know what? it doesn't matter.:::['5-17-217']
i'm never gonna meet her anyways. why?:::['5-17-218']
because it's impossible to find her apartment!:::['5-17-219']
she lives in some hot-girl parallel universe or something.:::['5-17-220']
she lives on the 2nd floor, 7th apartment from the left.:::['5-17-222']
no, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor, 8th apartment from the left.:::['5-17-223']
no. those first two windows, that's the lobby.:::['5-17-224']
that other window is the stairway. you've been counting wrong.:::['5-17-225']
i did not know that! thank you, monica.:::['5-17-226']
i almost lost another girl because of counting!:::['5-17-227']
so, uh, you ready?:::['5-17-228']
yeah, i'll just get my coat. okay.:::['5-17-229']
could you get that? sure.:::['5-17-230']
joey...? aah! no! no!:::['5-17-231']
uh, first, i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again.:::['5-17-232']
that's, uh, quite all right.:::['5-17-233']
but i feel obligated to tell you that this meeting is being videotaped.:::['5-17-234']
well, first, i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you......and, uh, for yelling at you.:::['5-17-236']
now, you're probably going to hire one of the people who, uh...:::['5-17-238']
who did... who did not, um, ahem......yell at you and storm out.:::['5-17-239']
and i think that's a big mistake. and here's why.:::['5-17-240']
i made a huge fool of myself, and i came back. that shows courage.:::['5-17-241']
when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job, i said no.:::['5-17-242']
that shows integrity.:::['5-17-243']
and i was not afraid to stand up for myself......and that shows courage.:::['5-17-244']
okay, ahem.:::['5-17-245']
now, i know that i've already said courage......but you've got to have courage.:::['5-17-246']
and, um, finally......when i thought you were making:::['5-17-247']
sexual advances in the workplace......i said no, and i was not litigious.:::['5-17-248']
so there you go. you got courage......you got integrity,you got courage again......and not litigious.:::['5-17-249']
look, mr...:::['5-17-250']
zelner. zelner!:::['5-17-251']
i knew that!:::['5-17-252']
oh, i knew that.:::['5-17-253']
i really, really want this job.:::['5-17-254']
and i think i would be really good at it.:::['5-17-255']
i may regret this, but, uh......i'm gonna give you a shot.:::['5-17-257']
oh, you are?:::['5-17-258']
mm-hm. really?:::['5-17-259']
oh, thank you. oh, god!:::['5-17-260']
would it be inappropriate if i gave you a hug?:::['5-17-261']
well, how about a handshake? ha-ha-ha.:::['5-17-263']
aah! oh, god! i'm sorry!:::['5-17-264']
oh, god, i did not mean to touch that! i mean, you!:::['5-17-265']
there! uh, there. um...:::['5-17-266']
okay, so, thank you.:::['5-17-267']
i'm gonna leave. thank you very much. thank you so much.:::['5-17-268']
hey, i'll see you monday.:::['5-17-269']
phoebe: are you tired? you better believe he's tired......after the day we had!:::['5-17-270']
if you know what i mean. do you know what i mean?:::['5-17-271']
honey? the tortilla chips know what you mean.:::['5-17-272']
so, uh, chandler, do you like that badge i got you?:::['5-17-273']
oh, yeah, it's so cool.:::['5-17-274']
now, i gotta go. officer bing's got a 10-100.:::['5-17-275']
that's pee-pee.:::['5-17-276']
phoebe, you have a twig in your hair.:::['5-17-277']
oh, ha, ha. um...:::['5-17-278']
we kind of took a detour on our way over here.:::['5-17-279']
we were strolling through the park and no one was around, so...:::['5-17-280']
you didn't. phoebe: we did!:::['5-17-281']
ha, ha. we violated section 12, paragraph 7 of the criminal code.:::['5-17-282']
the park, huh? ha, ha.:::['5-17-283']
public place. gary: uh-huh.:::['5-17-284']
i hear you. can you excuse me for a second?:::['5-17-285']
monica, this is the men's room.:::['5-17-287']
but see, i've always found the men's bathroom very sexual.:::['5-17-290']
haven't you? no.:::['5-17-291']
and if i did, i don't think we'd be going out.:::['5-17-292']
come on, we can't let them win! uh...:::['5-17-294']
we've proved that we are hot, okay? so why are you obsessed about this?:::['5-17-295']
phoebe and gary are in that "can't keep their hands off each other" phase!:::['5-17-296']
so? so.:::['5-17-297']
it makes me really sad that we're not really there anymore.:::['5-17-298']
oh, is that what this has all been about?:::['5-17-299']
wasn't it a lot more exciting when we were, you know......all over each other all the time?:::['5-17-300']
yeah, that was great. that was really great.:::['5-17-301']
but to tell you the truth, i'm more excited about where we are now.:::['5-17-302']
i've never been in a relationship that's lasted this long before.:::['5-17-304']
to get past the beginning and still want to be around each other?:::['5-17-305']
i think that's pretty incredible.:::['5-17-306']
and the fact that this is happening with you......i think that's pretty exciting.:::['5-17-307']
i know that i was acting a little crazy......but i feel the same way.:::['5-17-309']
mm?:::['5-17-310']
you know what i just realized?:::['5-17-311']
you just freaked out about our relationship.:::['5-17-312']
pfft, i did not. yes, you did!:::['5-17-313']
admit it. you freaked out!:::['5-17-314']
i freaked out a little.:::['5-17-315']
a little? you freaked out bigtime, okay?:::['5-17-316']
and i fixed it! we have switched places.:::['5-17-317']
i am the relationship king, and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!:::['5-17-318']
and now we're back.:::['5-17-319']
i cannot believe ross is buying this.:::['5-17-320']
thank god. i can't watch him anymore. ha-ha-ha.:::['5-17-321']
you guys ready for the movies? yeah.:::['5-17-322']
oh, by the way, thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine.:::['5-17-323']
man, they cannot get enough!:::['5-17-324']
chandler! chandler!:::['5-15-0']
i saw what you were doing through the window.:::['5-15-1']
i saw what you were doing to my sister, now, get out here!:::['5-15-2']
i mean, that's more than most people have in a lifetime. so goodbye, take care, bye-bye then.:::['5-15-5']
what are you doing? oh, i'm going on the lam.:::['5-15-6']
come on, chandler. come on. i can handle ross.:::['5-15-7']
what the hell are you doing? hey, what's going on?:::['5-15-10']
we're not just messing around. i love her. okay? i'm in love with her.:::['5-15-15']
you guys want to probably get some hugs in too, huh? big news.:::['5-15-20']
oh, no, that's okay. we've actually known for a while.:::['5-15-21']
what? what? you guys knew?:::['5-15-22']
you all knew and you didn't tell me?:::['5-15-23']
well, ross, we were worried about you, okay? we didn't know how you were going to react.:::['5-15-24']
joey: mm-mm.:::['5-15-25']
you were worried about me? you didn't know how i was gonna react?:::['5-15-26']
okay. all right. whew. what do you say we all, uh, clear out of here... ...and let these two love birds get back down to business.:::['5-15-27']
hey, hey, hey. i'm just talking here. he's the one doing your sister.:::['5-15-28']
hey, you know what i just realized?:::['5-15-29']
if you guys ever have kids... whoa, whoa, whoa. we're having kids?:::['5-15-30']
i call godfather.:::['5-15-31']
you can't just call godfather.:::['5-15-32']
don't you think her brother should be godfather?:::['5-15-33']
sure. if you cared enough to call it first.:::['5-15-34']
guys, you're a few steps ahead of us. yeah, big zero-gravity moon steps.:::['5-15-35']
oh, oh, i just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you.:::['5-15-36']
oh, i'll go in on that with you. i couldn't think of anything.:::['5-15-37']
hey, katie.:::['5-15-38']

hey, where are we going to lunch? i was thinking maybe chinese food.:::['5-15-42']
i love chinese.:::['5-15-43']
how did you know i love chinese?:::['5-15-44']
she is so cute. you could fit her right in your little pocket.:::['5-15-45']
i don't know. i mean, i like her a lot, and she's really nice, but...:::['5-15-46']
but what?:::['5-15-47']
she keeps punching me.:::['5-15-48']
in the cute little, sweet way she just did?:::['5-15-49']
hey, it's a lot harder than it looks, okay? she's hurting me.:::['5-15-50']
i know what you need. you need a bodyguard.:::['5-15-51']
hey, ross, what is ben doing after preschool?:::['5-15-52']
okay, come on, joey is having a problem. there's a little girl who's beating him up.:::['5-15-53']
aw, joey, come here. look. honey, i know. this must be really, really difficult for you, and...:::['5-15-54']
oh, i'm sorry, am i hurting you?:::['5-15-55']
i brought you some housewarming gifts. oh.:::['5-15-57']
salt, so your life always has flavor. ah.:::['5-15-58']
bread, so you never go hungry. oh.:::['5-15-59']
and a scented candle for the bathroom. because, well, you know.:::['5-15-60']
well, thanks. thanks. and thanks, i guess.:::['5-15-61']
hi. welcome to the building. i'm steve cera, president of the tenants' committee.:::['5-15-62']
oh, hi. ross geller. and, uh, this is my friend phoebe.:::['5-15-63']
hi, phoebe. mr. president.:::['5-15-64']
i, uh, came to talk to you about howard.:::['5-15-65']
howard? yeah, he's the handyman. he's gonna be retiring next week......and everyone who lives here is kicking in:::['5-15-66']
a hundred bucks... ...as a "thank you for all the hard work" type of thing.:::['5-15-67']
oh, that's nice. yeah. so you want to give me a check, or?:::['5-15-68']
you don't have to give it to me now. you can slip it under my door.:::['5-15-70']
no, no, it's not that. it's just... i just moved in.:::['5-15-71']
well, the guy's worked here for 25 years.:::['5-15-72']
yes, but i've lived here for 25 minutes.:::['5-15-73']
oh. okay, i get it.:::['5-15-74']
wait. look, i'm sorry, it's just i've never even met howard.:::['5-15-75']
i mean, i don't know howard. howard's the handyman.:::['5-15-76']
yes, but to me he's just "man.":::['5-15-77']
okay. fine. whatever. welcome to the building.:::['5-15-78']
can you believe that guy?:::['5-15-79']
yeah. i really like his glasses.:::['5-15-80']
so then president steve told everyone i was a cheapskate... ...and now the whole building hates me.:::['5-15-81']
a little kid spit on my knee.:::['5-15-82']
you know what? i'm gonna throw a party. that's right, for everyone in the building. and i'm gonna sit them all down and explain to them that i am not a bad guy.:::['5-15-83']
i am not a cheap guy. i'm just a guy......who stands up for what he believes in.:::['5-15-84']
a man with principles.:::['5-15-85']
sounds like a fun party. rachel: mm.:::['5-15-86']
look, ross, if you want your neighbors to like you... ...why don't you just pay the hundred bucks?:::['5-15-87']
a party's gonna cost you way more. that doesn't matter.:::['5-15-88']
it's my principles. we're talking about my principles.:::['5-15-89']
okay, i thought it was about your neighbors liking you.:::['5-15-90']
oh, they'll like me once they come to my awesome par-tay.:::['5-15-91']
okay, i gotta run. i gotta go get some nametags.:::['5-15-92']
and that crazy party animal will be your brother-in-law.:::['5-15-93']
very, very funny. but don't say things like that in from of monica. i don't want you putting any ideas in her head.:::['5-15-94']
um, chandler, you do realize that those ideas... ...are probably already in monica's head?:::['5-15-95']
well, because she loves you and because you love her.:::['5-15-97']
yeah, so? what's that supposed to mean?:::['5-15-98']
hey, chandler, don't freak out. i'm telling you something you already know.:::['5-15-99']
come on. she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies.:::['5-15-100']
and she's a woman, and she's almost 30, and, you know, it's monica.:::['5-15-101']
i don't see it that way. okay? i see two monicas::::['5-15-102']
the one that was my friend who lives across the hall and wanted a lot of babies.:::['5-15-103']
and the new monica who i started to date. now, who is to say what she wants?:::['5-15-104']
i'm right. i'm right. am i right?:::['5-15-105']
yeah, you're right. you are absolutely right. i mean, that makes everything different.:::['5-15-106']
it's not different, is it? not unless "different" means the same.:::['5-15-108']
you were so funny with that waiter. you're such a nut.:::['5-15-109']
you know, breadstick fangs are always funny.:::['5-15-110']
no, you make them funny. you're the funny one.:::['5-15-111']
uh, look, katie, uh, listen, we need to talk, okay?:::['5-15-112']
um, look, i like you. i really do. i like you a lot, okay?:::['5-15-113']
but sometimes when you playfully punch me like that......it feels like someone's hitting me:::['5-15-114']
with a very tiny, but a very real bat.:::['5-15-115']
oh. like i could hurt you. are you making fun of my size? no.:::['5-15-116']
don't make fun of me because of my size.:::['5-15-117']
isn't this great? mm.:::['5-15-118']
couldn't you just stay like this forever?:::['5-15-119']
chandler? couldn't you just stay here forever?:::['5-15-120']
yeah, here, somewhere else. you know, wherever. ha, ha.:::['5-15-121']
are you okay? yeah. i'm cool. casual.:::['5-15-122']
just hanging out. having fun, you know, uh, with the girl that i'm seeing casually.:::['5-15-124']
man, i knew it. i knew you were going to do this.:::['5-15-125']
what? get all freaked out because everybody was joking around about marriage.:::['5-15-126']
well, you do want all that stuff, right? and you know what i want?:::['5-15-127']
yes. you want babies. you have baby fever.:::['5-15-128']
i do not have baby fever.:::['5-15-129']
oh, please. you are obsessed with babies and marriage......and everything that's:::['5-15-130']
related to babies and marriage.:::['5-15-131']
you know what? why don't we turn the heat down on this pressure cooker?:::['5-15-132']
have you lost your mind? chandler, this isn't about me. this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap.:::['5-15-133']
uh-uh. i know you, okay? i know the thoughts that you have in your head.:::['5-15-134']
well, you don't know everything.:::['5-15-135']
did you know i'm going out with rachel tonight instead of you? hmm?:::['5-15-136']
and that the only baby around here is you?:::['5-15-137']
and did you know i can't even look at you right now?:::['5-15-138']
yeah, well, i did not know that.:::['5-15-139']
it's gonna be okay, right? i mean, she's not gonna leave me. this is fixable.:::['5-15-140']
yeah, sure. absolutely.:::['5-15-141']
by me? oh, no, no, no.:::['5-15-142']
well, unless you make some kind of big gesture. joey: yeah, big, though.:::['5-15-143']
shh. the missus.:::['5-15-144']
monica: gunther, can i get a coffee?:::['5-15-145']
to go.:::['5-15-146']
chandler: monica... i'm still not done not wanting to talk to you.:::['5-15-147']
just tell me what i need to do to make things right.:::['5-15-148']
what? that's what we do.:::['5-15-149']
i mess up, you tell me how to fix it and i do. and then, you know, you think i'm all cute again.:::['5-15-150']
i'm really tired of being your relationship tutor. you're gonna have to figure this out for yourself.:::['5-15-151']
you know what? if you're too afraid to be in a real relationship... ...then don't be in one.:::['5-15-152']
right about now funk soul brother:::['5-15-154', '5-15-156']

you chipped in? yeah, uh-huh, hundred dollars.:::['5-15-165']
phoebe, i can't believe you gave him money.:::['5-15-166']
i thought you agreed it was unreasonable that they asked me for that money.:::['5-15-167']
yeah, but they didn't ask me, you know?:::['5-15-168']
this way i'm just, you know, the exotic, generous stranger. that's always fun to be.:::['5-15-169']
yeah, but you're making me look bad.:::['5-15-170']
no, i'm not. no, if anything, i'm making you look better.:::['5-15-171']
they'll see you talking to me, and i'm a hit.:::['5-15-172']
oh, hey, ross. um, say, i was thinking maybe you two could switch apartments. because phoebe is more our kind of people.:::['5-15-174']
something to think about it.:::['5-15-175']
yeah, okay, my bad.:::['5-15-176']

uh, yeah. but it's not obvious why.:::['5-15-181']
well, look, i'm breaking up with katie, so i had to put on some extra padding.:::['5-15-182']
you know, i mean, if she hits me when she's happy......can you imagine how hard:::['5-15-183']
she's gonna hit me... ...when i tell her i'm taking away the joey love?:::['5-15-184']
hey. hey, cute jacket.:::['5-15-186']

so, uh, what did you tell them about me?:::['5-15-206']
um, i told them about you and emily. you know, trying to get some sympathy.:::['5-15-207']
but somehow you came off as the bad guy.:::['5-15-208']
what? yeah, i think i told it wrong.:::['5-15-209']
we should talk about that... ...because i don't totally understand what happened there.:::['5-15-210']
oh. this cake is really good.:::['5-15-211']
okay, see? things are looking up already.:::['5-15-212']
oh, my god. someone cut howard's cake.:::['5-15-213']

who here likes ross?:::['5-15-219']
of course you don't like him.:::['5-15-220']
he didn't give you any money. he raised his own hand when i asked, "who here likes ross?":::['5-15-221']
and he's wearing two nametags.:::['5-15-222']
i'll be honest with you guys. when i first met ross, i didn't like him at all.:::['5-15-223']
but then once i got to know him, i saw that he's really sweet......and caring and very generous.:::['5-15-224']
i mean, all i'm saying is don't judge ross before you get to know him, all right?:::['5-15-225']
you know, i like all of you guys now. but when i first met you, you know...:::['5-15-226']
kurt? i thought, you know, abrasive drunk.:::['5-15-227']
um, lola, mind-numbingly stupid.:::['5-15-228']
and, okay, you guys: gold digger, cradle-robbing perv.:::['5-15-229']
so i think you all know what i mean.:::['5-15-230']
obviously, i didn't think they were gonna start throwing things.:::['5-15-231']
i just thought if i kept insulting them you would jump in and defend everyone.:::['5-15-232']
then you could look like the hero. oh, wow, yeah.:::['5-15-233']
see, i did not get that.:::['5-15-234']
where's monica? where is she? i need to talk to her, it's urgent. is she here?:::['5-15-235']
i'm monica. i need to talk to you. it's urgent.:::['5-15-236']
okay. okay, i've been doing a lot of thinking......about us. you know,a lot of, uh, "us" thinking.:::['5-15-237']
and, uh, well, i guess there's only one way to do this.:::['5-15-238']
wait, wait. what are you doing? monica...:::['5-15-239']
no, no, no. don't do it.:::['5-15-240']
ross: oh, no, no, no. joey: what a bad idea.:::['5-15-242']
oh, i can't not look at it.:::['5-15-243']
chandler, why are you doing this? i don't know.:::['5-15-244']
but i know i'm not afraid to do this.:::['5-15-245']
chandler. i'm doing this because i'm sorry?:::['5-15-246']
do you, um, really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?:::['5-15-247']
oh, no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy.:::['5-15-248']
sorry is pretty much fourth, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.:::['5-15-249']
will you be my wife?:::['5-15-250']
chandler, um, i want you to take just a minute... ...and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.:::['5-15-251']
yeah, i'm kind of wishing everyone wasn't here right now.:::['5-15-252']
you know that none of that stuff came from me. i mean, i never said that i wanted to have babies and get married right now.:::['5-15-253']
yeah, i know, i was really confused, and then i talked to these guys.:::['5-15-254']
who? two divorces and joey?:::['5-15-255']
hey. she's right, you know.:::['5-15-256']
yeah, but still, cheap shot.:::['5-15-257']
you know when i said that i want you... ...to deal with relationship stuff all on your own?:::['5-15-258']
well, you're not ready for that. i didn't think i was.:::['5-15-259']
oh, my god. what would you have done if i had said yes?:::['5-15-260']
well, i would've been happy because... ...i would have been able spend the rest of my life with the woman i love.:::['5-15-261']
or you would have seen a chandler-shaped hole in that door.:::['5-15-262']
hey, ross, will you pass me that knife? no, i will not.:::['5-15-263']
it's okay. you don't have to be so mean about it.:::['5-15-264']
you're right. i'm sorry. will you marry me?:::['5-15-265']
oh, and i was going to ask you to marry me... ...because i forgot to say hello to you last week.:::['5-15-266']
oh, no, wait, pheebs. i think with something like that... ...you just ask them to move in with you. but i'm not sure. chandler?:::['5-15-267']
ha, ha, okay, how long is this gonna go on?:::['5-15-268']
well, i think the length of teasing... ...is directly related to how insane you were. so a long time.:::['5-15-269']
this is fun. oh, hey, rach, remember that whole "we were on a break" thing?:::['5-15-270']
well, i'm sorry, will you marry me?:::['5-15-271']
all: that's not funny.:::['5-15-272']
phoebe: oh, hey, you guys, look. ugly naked guy's putting stuff in boxes.:::['5-14-0']
huh. i'd say from the looks of it, our naked buddy is moving.:::['5-14-2']
ironically, most of the boxes seem to be labeled "clothes.":::['5-14-3']
aw, i'm going to miss that big old squishy butt.:::['5-14-4']
and we're done with the chicken fried rice.:::['5-14-5']
hey. hey, if he's moving, maybe i should try to get his place.:::['5-14-6']
phoebe: oh, yeah. joey: good idea.:::['5-14-7']
it would be so cool to live across from you guys.:::['5-14-8']
yeah, hey, then we could do that telephone thing......you know, where you have a can,we have a can......and it's connected by a string.:::['5-14-9']
or we could do the actual telephone thing.:::['5-14-10']
oh, my god. i love this apartment.:::['5-14-11']
isn't it perfect?:::['5-14-12']
i can't believe i never realized how great it is.:::['5-14-13']
that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man.:::['5-14-14']
phoebe: it's amazing.:::['5-14-15']
you better hurry up and fill out an application, or i'll beat you to it.:::['5-14-16']
well, i never thought i'd say this, but i'm gonna go use ugly naked guy's bathroom.:::['5-14-18']
oh, look. there's monica and chandler. hey!:::['5-14-19']
hey, you guys! hey!:::['5-14-20']
aah! chandler and monica. chandler and monica.:::['5-14-23']
chandler and monica! oh, my god!:::['5-14-25']
oh, my eyes! my eyes!:::['5-14-26']
phoebe. phoebe. ow!:::['5-14-27']
no, they're doing it! i know.:::['5-14-29']
i know. i know. you know?:::['5-14-30']
yes, i know, and joey knows, but ross doesn't......so you have to stop screaming!:::['5-14-31']
what? rachel: nothing.:::['5-14-33']
oh, god, we're just so excited that you might get this apartment.:::['5-14-34']
actually, it looks really good. aah! it looks pretty good!:::['5-14-35']
get in here! come on!:::['5-14-36']
you mean whenever monica and chandler were, like......doing laundry:::['5-14-37']
or going grocery shopping?:::['5-14-38']
all that time monica spent on the phone with sad linda from camp?:::['5-14-39']
uh-huh. doing it, doing it, phone doing it.:::['5-14-40']
i mean, i think it's great. for him.:::['5-14-42']
she might be able to do better.:::['5-14-43']
hey, you guys. joey, come here. come here.:::['5-14-44']
phoebe just found out about monica and chandler.:::['5-14-45']
you mean how they're friends and nothing more?:::['5-14-46']
no. no, joey, she knows.:::['5-14-47']
we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and saw them doing it through the window.:::['5-14-48']
actually, we saw them doing it up against the window.:::['5-14-49']
okay, so now they know you know, and they don't know rachel knows?:::['5-14-50']
yes, but you know what? it doesn't matter who knows what.:::['5-14-51']
now enough of us know that we could just tell them we know.:::['5-14-52']
now all the lying and the secrets will finally be over.:::['5-14-53']
or we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own.:::['5-14-54']
well, what do you mean?:::['5-14-55']
you know, every time they say they're doing laundry......we'll give them laundry to do.:::['5-14-56']
oh, i would enjoy that. no, no, no.:::['5-14-57']
wait, rach, you know what would be even more fun? telling them.:::['5-14-58']
yeah, no, i want to do phoebe's thing. i can't take any...:::['5-14-59']
you don't have to do anything. just don't tell them that we know.:::['5-14-60']
no. i can't take any more secrets.:::['5-14-61']
i got your secrets, i got their secrets. i got secrets of my own, you know.:::['5-14-62']
you don't have any secrets. oh, yeah?:::['5-14-63']
well, you don't know about hugsy, my bedtime penguin pal.:::['5-14-64']
so, ahem, um...:::['5-14-65']
how are we going to mess with them?:::['5-14-66']
well, you could use your position as the roommate.:::['5-14-67']
and then i would use, you know, the strongest tool at my disposal.:::['5-14-68']
my sexuality.:::['5-14-69']
hello, children. all: hey.:::['5-14-70', '4-10-107']
okay. watch, learn, and don't eat my cookie.:::['5-14-71']
ooh. wow, that jacket looks great on you.:::['5-14-73']
really? yeah. the material looks so soft.:::['5-14-74']
oh, hello, mr. bicep.:::['5-14-75']
you've been working out?:::['5-14-76']
well, i try to, you know, squeeze things.:::['5-14-77']
well, if you really wanna know...:::['5-14-79']
oh, i can't tell you this.:::['5-14-80']
phoebe, it's me, you can tell me anything.:::['5-14-81']
well, actually, you're the one person i can't tell this to.:::['5-14-82']
and the one person i want to the most.:::['5-14-83']
i think it's just, you know, that i haven't been with a guy in so long......and you know how sometimes:::['5-14-85']
you're looking for something......and you don't see that it's right there:::['5-14-86']
in front of you, sipping coffee...:::['5-14-87']
oh, no. have i said too much?:::['5-14-88']
well, just something to think about. i know i will.:::['5-14-89']
ooh. ha, ha.:::['5-14-90']
you are so cute. heh.:::['5-14-91']
how did you get to be so cute?:::['5-14-92']
well, my grandfather was swedish.:::['5-14-93']
and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny.:::['5-14-94']
okay, now you're even cuter.:::['5-14-95']
you know, that is a popular opinion today, i must say.:::['5-14-96']
the weirdest thing happened at the coffeehouse.:::['5-14-98']
i think phoebe was hitting on me.:::['5-14-99']
i'm telling you, i think phoebe thinks i'm foxy.:::['5-14-101']
it's not possible. ow.:::['5-14-102']
i'm sorry, it's just phoebe's just always thought you were charming......in a sexless kind of way.:::['5-14-103']
oh, well, you know, i can't hear that enough.:::['5-14-104']
i'm sorry, i just think you misunderstood her.:::['5-14-105']
no, i didn't misunderstand, okay? she was all over me.:::['5-14-106']
she touched my bicep, for crying out loud.:::['5-14-107']
this bicep?:::['5-14-108']
well, it's not flexed right now.:::['5-14-109']
hey, mon, what are you doing? want to come see a movie with us?:::['5-14-110']
uh, actually, i was going to do some laundry.:::['5-14-111']
chandler, you want to do it with me? sure, i'll do it with you.:::['5-14-112']
okay, great. hold on a second.:::['5-14-113']
unh. here you go.:::['5-14-114']
you don't mind, do you? that would really help me out a lot. thanks.:::['5-14-115']
ha, ha. you know what? i don't think i have enough quarters.:::['5-14-116']
phoebe: oh, i have quarters.:::['5-14-117']
hey. hey, ross, any word on the apartment yet?:::['5-14-118']
well, i called over there, and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself.:::['5-14-119']
and he's already had like 100 applicants.:::['5-14-120']
all: oh. no, no, i've got the edge.:::['5-14-121']
i know it's not exactly ethical, but i sent him a bribe......to tip the scales in my direction.:::['5-14-122']
yeah. check it out, you can see it from the window.:::['5-14-123']
oh, is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it?:::['5-14-124']
that new mountain bike?:::['5-14-126']
well, what did you send?:::['5-14-128']
a basket of mini muffins.:::['5-14-129']
there's a whole table of mini muffin baskets.:::['5-14-130']
which one did you send?:::['5-14-131']
the small one.:::['5-14-132']
what? you actually thought that basket was gonna get you the apartment?:::['5-14-133']
someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those muffins.:::['5-14-135']
it was the best day.:::['5-14-136']
your work makes me sad.:::['5-14-137']
oh, man, i want that place so much.:::['5-14-138']
and i was so sure that was going to work.:::['5-14-139']
there's 12 bucks i'll never see again.:::['5-14-140']
all right, we'd better go if we're gonna catch that movie.:::['5-14-141']
okay, did you see that? with the inappropriate, and the pinching?:::['5-14-144']
oh, my god. oh, my god. she knows about us.:::['5-14-147']
phoebe knows, and she's just trying to freak us out.:::['5-14-149']
that's the only explanation for it.:::['5-14-150']
okay, but what about my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps?:::['5-14-151']
she knows.:::['5-14-152']
phoebe knows about us.:::['5-14-155']
well, i didn't tell them.:::['5-14-156']
them? who's "them"?:::['5-14-157']
look, i would have told you, but they made me promise not to tell.:::['5-14-161']
oh, man. i'm sorry.:::['5-14-162']
but, hey, it's over now, right?:::['5-14-163']
because you can tell them you know they know......and i can go back to knowing:::['5-14-164']
absolutely nothing.:::['5-14-165']
unless... no, not "unless." this must end now.:::['5-14-166']
oh, man, they think they are so slick messing with us.:::['5-14-167']
but they don't know that we know that they know.:::['5-14-168']
so... ah, yes.:::['5-14-169']
the messers become the messees.:::['5-14-170']
oh, ross, honey, you gotta stop torturing yourself.:::['5-14-171']
why don't you just find another apartment?:::['5-14-172']
i've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month.:::['5-14-173']
none of them even compares to that one.:::['5-14-174']
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him.:::['5-14-176']
yeah. like if i wanted something from joey......i would strike up a conversation:::['5-14-177']
about, say, um, sandwiches......or, uh, my underwear.:::['5-14-178']
i'm listening.:::['5-14-179']
that is a great idea.:::['5-14-181']
and i know ugly naked guy because we've been watching him for five years.:::['5-14-182']
so that gives me back my edge. ha, ha.:::['5-14-183']
let's see now. he had the trampoline.:::['5-14-184']
but he broke that. well, he had gravity boots.:::['5-14-185']
yeah, he broke those too.:::['5-14-186']
so he likes to break stuff.:::['5-14-187']
okay, i've got to go pick up ben, but i will figure something out.:::['5-14-188']
hey, didn't he used to have a cat?:::['5-14-189']
i wouldn't bring that up. it would probably just bum him out.:::['5-14-190']
poor cat never saw that big butt coming.:::['5-14-191']
oh, yeah, hey. hold on a second, she's right here.:::['5-14-193']
it's chandler.:::['5-14-194']
hello, you.:::['5-14-196']
hello, phoebe, i've been thinking about you all day.:::['5-14-197']
well, you know that thing you said before? i'd be lying if i said i wasn't intrigued.:::['5-14-199']
yeah. listen, joey won't be here tonight.:::['5-14-201']
why don't you come over and i'll let you, uh, feel my bicep.:::['5-14-202']
or maybe more.:::['5-14-203']
i'll have to get back to you on that. okay, bye.:::['5-14-204']
oh, my god. he wants me to come over and feel his bicep and more.:::['5-14-205']
i cannot believe he would do that to mon...:::['5-14-207']
no. joey?:::['5-14-209']
they know you know. ooh, i knew it.:::['5-14-210']
oh, i cannot believe those two.:::['5-14-211']
they thought they could mess with us? they're trying to mess with us?:::['5-14-212']
and, joey, you can't say anything.:::['5-14-214']
good evening, sir. my name is ross geller.:::['5-14-216']
i'm one of the people who applied for the apartment......and i realize that the competition:::['5-14-217']
is fierce, but...:::['5-14-218']
i'm sorry, i can't help but notice that you're naked and...:::['5-14-219']
i applaud you.:::['5-14-220']
man, i wish i was naked.:::['5-14-221']
i mean, this looks so great.:::['5-14-222']
that is how god intended it.:::['5-14-223']
look at them. they're panicked. oh, yeah, they're totally gonna back down.:::['5-14-224']
all right, if he wants a date, he's going to get a date.:::['5-14-226']
i'm going to go in. okay, okay.:::['5-14-227']
be sexy.:::['5-14-228']
so, chandler, i'd love to come by tonight.:::['5-14-230']
oh, absolutely. should we say around 7?:::['5-14-232']

hey, hey, check it out, check it out. ugly naked guy's got a naked friend.:::['5-14-235']

okay, rachel, get me perfume.:::['5-14-240']
and, joey, can you get me a bottle of wine and glasses?:::['5-14-241']
all right, it'll be great.:::['5-14-242']
you just make her think you want to have sex with her and it'll freak her out.:::['5-14-243']
okay, listen, how far am i gonna have to go with her?:::['5-14-244']
relax, she's gonna give in way before you do.:::['5-14-245']
how do you know? because you're on my team.:::['5-14-246']
and my team always wins.:::['5-14-247']
at this?:::['5-14-248']

oh, man, aren't you guys done yet?:::['5-14-279']

oh, okay. show him your bra. he's afraid of bras. can't work them.:::['5-14-284']

i'm gonna kiss you now. not if i kiss you first.:::['5-14-298']
well, i guess there's nothing left for us to do but kiss.:::['5-14-299']
okay, okay, okay. you win.:::['5-14-302']
ha! i can't have sex with you.:::['5-14-303']

you're... you're what?:::['5-14-305']
love her. that's right. i love her.:::['5-14-306']
i just thought you guys were doing it. i didn't know you were in love.:::['5-14-310']
hats off to phoebe. quite a competitor.:::['5-14-312']
and may i say your breasts are still showing?:::['5-14-313']
phoebe: god.:::['5-14-314']
all right. so that's it?:::['5-14-315']
it's over. everybody knows.:::['5-14-316']
well, actually, ross doesn't.:::['5-14-317']
yes, and we'd appreciate it if no one told him yet.:::['5-14-318']
a new place for a new ross.:::['5-14-319']
i'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over......once it's, you know, furnished.:::['5-14-320']
i must say, it's nice to see you back on your feet.:::['5-14-321']
well, i am that, uh, and the whole rage thing is definitely behind me.:::['5-14-322']
i wonder if it's time for you to rejoin our team at the museum.:::['5-14-323']
oh, donald, that would be great.:::['5-14-324']
i am totally ready to come back to work. i...:::['5-14-325']
you can't stand to be in the same room.:::['4-8-1']
i just thought i'd try and apologize over the phone...:::['4-8-2']
should've kissed your girlfriend, and i'm...:::['4-8-4']
stop calling!:::['4-8-5']
hey, hey, hey. this is 92.3 wxrk k-rock......calling with our $1000 daily challenge.:::['4-8-6']
what is the name of... ...your roommate who is very, very sorry and would do anything...?:::['4-8-8']
ugh, turkey. ugh, giving thanks. ugh.:::['4-8-9']
look, everyone, it's the spirit of thanksgiving.:::['4-8-10']
are things with joey any better?:::['4-8-11']
they couldn't be worse. i spent eight hours calling him... ...trying to get him to talk to me.:::['4-8-12']
oh, wow. eight hours.:::['4-8-13']
so you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets, huh?:::['4-8-14']
should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?:::['4-8-15']
you shouldn't.:::['4-8-16']
speaking of christmas......since monica and i are starting:::['4-8-17']
a new business and have like no money......this year maybe we could do secret santa:::['4-8-18']
and then we each only buy one gift.:::['4-8-19']
and there's the added mystery of, you know, who gets who.:::['4-8-20']
who gets "whom.":::['4-8-21']
i don't know why i do that.:::['4-8-22']
oh, i'm gonna take a nap. turkey makes me sleepy.:::['4-8-23']
we haven't eaten yet.:::['4-8-24']
i know, but all that work you're doing to get it ready, and i just...:::['4-8-25']
hey, did either of you pick rachel for your secret santa?:::['4-8-26']
because i wanna trade for her. i picked her. oh, thank god, you want her.:::['4-8-27']
wow, why do you wanna get rid of her so badly?:::['4-8-29']
because she exchanges every gift she gets. it's, like, impossible to get her something she likes.:::['4-8-30']
come on, let's trade.:::['4-8-31']
that's not true. i got her that backpack and she loved it.:::['4-8-32']
i remember how much she was crying the day that big dog ran off with...:::['4-8-33']
there was no big dog.:::['4-8-34']
this sucks, because i already got her this briefcase and i had "r.g." put on it.:::['4-8-35']
her initials. oh.:::['4-8-36']
maybe you can give it to somebody else. oh. like ross geller.:::['4-8-37']
oh, you know what, though? it's a girlie briefcase.:::['4-8-38']
who cares? he works in a museum.:::['4-8-39']
hey, what time is it? the big game's about to start.:::['4-8-40']
ross and joey aren't here. you can watch the parade if you want.:::['4-8-41']
monica: what is wrong with this freezer? ow! ow!:::['4-8-43']
god, what happened? oh, my god, ice just got in my eye.:::['4-8-44']
people are trying to sleep in here.:::['4-8-45']
monica got ice in her eye and it hurts.:::['4-8-46']
open it up. let me see. oh, i can't. it really kills.:::['4-8-47']
well, maybe you should put some ice on it.:::['4-8-48']
ooh, it looks bad. maybe we should take you to a doctor.:::['4-8-49']
no, my eye doctor is richard.:::['4-8-50']
i can't go to him when i don't have a boyfriend.:::['4-8-51']
he's really picky about his patients.:::['4-8-52']
okay, you've gotta go. what's his office number?:::['4-8-53']
oh, like i remember his office number.:::['4-8-54']
speed dial 7.:::['4-8-55']
hi, yeah, i'm calling on behalf of monica geller's eye, and...:::['4-8-56']
is richard burke in today?:::['4-8-57']
he's out of town. does she wanna see the on-call doctor?:::['4-8-58']
yes. yes. she's very excited about that.:::['4-8-59']
it's so cool. till monica gets back, it's like i'm head chef and i get to make all the decisions.:::['4-8-60']
hey, hey, i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly.:::['4-8-61']
okay, get out of my kitchen.:::['4-8-62']
all right, okay. i think i'm making some progress with joey.:::['4-8-63']
when i went into the apartment, he went to his bedroom... ...but he only slammed the door once.:::['4-8-64']
i mean, yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.:::['4-8-65']
all right, i gotta call my mom and ask her a left-handed cooking question.:::['4-8-66']
so listen, i picked monica for secret santa......but i'm getting her something:::['4-8-67']
for hanukkah. you wanna switch?:::['4-8-68']
oh, you know what? i was trying to trade for, uh, ahem, well, you.:::['4-8-69']
really? wow, that's so nice. what are you gonna get me?:::['4-8-70']
i don't know, r.g. i was thinking something girlie for your office.:::['4-8-71']
yeah. well, maybe phoebe will switch with me.:::['4-8-72']
then you're gonna get stuck with rachel, and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.:::['4-8-73']
oh, that's not true. i got her lots of stuff she never took back.:::['4-8-74']
like that gold necklace i got her last year.:::['4-8-76']
when was the last time you saw her wear it?:::['4-8-77']
well, she wore it all christmas day and then, uh...:::['4-8-78']
big dog?:::['4-8-79']
sending back this stuff chandler bought out of guilt.:::['4-8-82']
everything? even the tv? no, i'm gonna put that in my room.:::['4-8-83']
listen, joey. i know what he did was wrong.:::['4-8-84']
but don't you think you could hear the guy out?:::['4-8-85']
when you and rachel were together......if chandler had kissed her,would you hear him out?:::['4-8-86']
that's a good point.:::['4-8-87']
so how long you gonna punish him? five years.:::['4-8-88']
you've sentenced him? hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.:::['4-8-89']
but, joey, the guy's your best friend. no, was my best friend.:::['4-8-90']
i don't know why you're pushing for him so hard.:::['4-8-91']
with him out of the way as my best friend, there's a spot open.:::['4-8-92']
who, me? yeah.:::['4-8-93']
wow. i'm honored. you know what i'm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?:::['4-8-94']
i'm gonna get you to talk to chandler.:::['4-8-95']
oh, but if you weren't my best friend...:::['4-8-97']
oh, my god. is it really that bad?:::['4-8-99']
i walk in the room, and he won't even talk to me.:::['4-8-100']
he just mumbles something in italian.:::['4-8-101']
and i know he only knows the bad words.:::['4-8-102']
hey, gunther, have you seen chandler?:::['4-8-103']
i thought you were chandler.:::['4-8-104']
but, um, one of you is over there.:::['4-8-105']
i'll be right with you, okay? thanks for coming in.:::['4-8-108']
oh, my god. how cute is the on-call doctor?:::['4-8-109']
oh. so cute that i'm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.:::['4-8-110']
dr. burke will see you now.:::['4-8-111']
oh, no, no, no, not dr. burke. dr. burke's out of town. the on-call doctor will see me now.:::['4-8-112']
dr. richard burke is out. dr. timothy burke, his son, will see you now.:::['4-8-113']
hey, i'm sorry. that...:::['4-8-115']
where you going? my folks'.:::['4-8-116']
oh. uh...:::['4-8-117']
when you coming back?:::['4-8-118']
i don't know. i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment.:::['4-8-119']
yeah, you know, at first i thought we could talk about this, work it out.:::['4-8-121']
but seeing you two together, i don't...:::['4-8-122']
hey, look, what do you want me to say? do you want me to say i'll stop seeing her?:::['4-8-123']
it's not about her. okay?:::['4-8-124']
but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did.:::['4-8-125']
and i don't wanna live with someone who doesn't know what it is to be a friend.:::['4-8-126']
so i'll see you. hey, look, i know what it is to be a friend.:::['4-8-127']
i just... i screwed up. yeah, you did.:::['4-8-128']
and that's why i'm leaving.:::['4-8-129']
look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them.:::['4-8-130']
okay? they have had a very difficult year, what with the robbery and all.:::['4-8-131']
when that guy was robbing us... ...and i was locked in the entertainment unit for six hours......do you know what i was doing?:::['4-8-132']
i was thinking about how i let you down.:::['4-8-133']
if i'd have known what kind of friend you were gonna be, i wouldn't have worried.:::['4-8-135']
see you around. all right, wait, come on.:::['4-8-136']
just wait one second. there has to be something that i can do.:::['4-8-137']
if we still had that unit... ...i would get in there for six hours and think about how i let you down.:::['4-8-138']
we got a box.:::['4-8-140']
i remember the last time i saw you. it was the morning i left for college.:::['4-8-141']
you were just standing outside the dairy queen.:::['4-8-142']
heh. just probably waiting for it to open.:::['4-8-143']
gotta tell you, you look great now.:::['4-8-144']
you look great too. you're an excellent patient.:::['4-8-145']
so how does it look?:::['4-8-146']
you've got a little scratch on your cornea. you're gonna have to wear a patch.:::['4-8-147']
like a pirate?:::['4-8-148']
if that helps you.:::['4-8-149']
ahem. so how long have you been working with your dad?:::['4-8-150']
come on, one of us had to mention him.:::['4-8-151']
i moved back here a couple months ago.:::['4-8-152']
big family dinner tonight? uh...:::['4-8-154']
monica: no way.:::['4-8-155']
i was gonna have thanksgiving at my girlfriend's.:::['4-8-156']
oh. but we broke up.:::['4-8-157']
oh?:::['4-8-158', '3-21-99', '3-1-316']
she wasn't ready for a serious commitment.:::['4-8-159']
walk the plank, aye, matey?:::['4-8-161']
you're not wearing the patch yet.:::['4-8-162']
he's coming here for thanksgiving? i know. it's sick.:::['4-8-164']
why is it sick? because it's richard's son.:::['4-8-165']
it's like inviting a greek tragedy over for dinner.:::['4-8-166']
i mean, come on, phoebe, you understand, don't you?:::['4-8-167']
yeah, i could see where i'd be your best shot, but no.:::['4-8-168']
sorry, honey. i think it's twisted. yeah.:::['4-8-169']
what's twisted? oh. me going out with richard's son.:::['4-8-170']
chandler: it sounds like a really bad idea to me.:::['4-8-173']
is he okay in there? he's fine.:::['4-8-174']
you know, if things work out between you and richard's son......you'll be able to tell your kids:::['4-8-175']
that you slept with their grandfather.:::['4-8-176']
fine, judge all you want to.:::['4-8-177']
but married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer......threw a girl's wooden leg in the fire,live in a box.:::['4-8-178']
so, now, ahem, what exactly is the point of the box?:::['4-8-179']
chandler: the meaning of the box is threefold.:::['4-8-181']
one, it gives me the time to think about what i did.:::['4-8-182']
two, it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey.:::['4-8-183']
and three... ...it hurts.:::['4-8-184']
oh, hey, hey, uh... hmm?:::['4-8-185']
remember that necklace i gave you last year? can i see it?:::['4-8-186']
why? i just wanna check something.:::['4-8-187']
now we'll see.:::['4-8-189']
chandler: air hole! air hole!:::['4-8-190']
here it is. i love it. i wear it all the time.:::['4-8-191']
the necklace i got you was gold. this is silver.:::['4-8-192']
well, maybe, it, uh... ...it changed.:::['4-8-194']
oh, my god. you actually exchanged it.:::['4-8-195']
isn't it better that i exchange it for something that i enjoy... ...and i can get a lot of use out of?:::['4-8-196']
what did you get? credit.:::['4-8-197']
i'll get it, i'll get it, i'll get it.:::['4-8-198']
hi, tim. hi.:::['4-8-199']
hi. thank you. come meet my friends.:::['4-8-200']
this is phoebe. hi, nice to meet you.:::['4-8-201']
and joey. hey.:::['4-8-202']
tim: joey. monica: my brother, ross.:::['4-8-203']
hey. monica: and rachel.:::['4-8-204']
hi. chandler: ahem.:::['4-8-205']
that's chandler. chandler: how do you do?:::['4-8-206']
what's...? um, well, he's, um...:::['4-8-207']
he's doing some thinking.:::['4-8-208']
he's got it.:::['4-8-209']
yes! yeah!:::['4-8-210']
chandler: what happened? you kissed my girlfriend.:::['4-8-211']
ooh, i like those sunglasses.:::['4-8-212']
"like them" like them... ...or "i'd like to get store credit for that amount" like them?:::['4-8-213']
all right, everybody. this turkey is ready.:::['4-8-214']
where can i wash up? monica: here.:::['4-8-215']
let me show you.:::['4-8-216']
the towels are hanging next to the sink. and you can use the fancy soap. ha, ha.:::['4-8-217']
fancy soap? i thought we were saving that for the pope.:::['4-8-219']
see? he's nice, right?:::['4-8-220']
do you really wanna be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase......"that's not how your dad:::['4-8-221']
used to do it"?:::['4-8-222']
wow, everything looks great. where should i sit? saved you a seat.:::['4-8-223']
sick, sick, sick.:::['4-8-224']
chandler: gotcha.:::['4-8-226']
that doesn't sound like thinking to me.:::['4-8-227']
chandler: sorry. i don't think you should be talking at all.:::['4-8-228']
i think you got too much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes.:::['4-8-229']
chandler: okay, okay, you got it.:::['4-8-230']
ross, could you pass me the yams? sure.:::['4-8-231']
oh, and joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.:::['4-8-232']
will you stop? what is the matter with you?:::['4-8-233']
heh, heh. we've got company.:::['4-8-234']
there's nothing the matter with me.:::['4-8-235']
see, i'm not completely devoid of sentiment. see, i have feelings.:::['4-8-236']
chandler: you can't tell, but i'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys.:::['4-8-238']
if this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?:::['4-8-240']
this means something to me.:::['4-8-241']
if it doesn't mean anything to you, then get out of there. otherwise, you're just an idiot in a box.:::['4-8-242']
chandler: you're right. i'm sorry. this means a lot to me.:::['4-8-243']
i want you to be my friend again. i swear i won't say another word tonight.:::['4-8-244']
so you're gonna take this thing seriously? chandler: absolutely.:::['4-8-245']
that sounds like another word to me.:::['4-8-246']
are you gonna take this seriously?:::['4-8-247']
don't say that i have no sentiment.:::['4-8-249']
this is a movie stub from our first date.:::['4-8-250']
this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed.:::['4-8-251']
this is from the museum, the first time we......were together.:::['4-8-252']
okay, maybe i exchange gifts sometimes, but i keep the things that matter.:::['4-8-253']
i don't know what to say. i'm sorry.:::['4-8-254']
though... ...you're not supposed to take these.:::['4-8-255']
it's like a million years old.:::['4-8-256']
we actually... we have people looking for that.:::['4-8-257']
oh, this always happens. here, let me, um...:::['4-8-258']
you have very beautiful... ...eye.:::['4-8-260']
my friends all think this is weird.:::['4-8-261']
i thought it was gonna be weird. i almost called to cancel, but it really isn't.:::['4-8-262']
i know. i mean, it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.:::['4-8-263']
oh, i totally agree.:::['4-8-264']
i mean, we're just two people who find each other... ...very attractive. right?:::['4-8-265']
what? nothing, nothing.:::['4-8-266']
no, no, really. oh, was that not okay? no, no, no, that was good.:::['4-8-267']
that was, uh... that was a good kiss.:::['4-8-268']
oh, my god. it didn't remind you of my...? oh, don't say it.:::['4-8-269']
but it did, didn't it? yes!:::['4-8-270']
i want you to know how sorry i am... it's okay.:::['4-8-276']
chandler's the one i'm mad at, so...:::['4-8-277']
well, i'm still sorry.:::['4-8-278']
is he here? in the box.:::['4-8-279']
oh, he can't talk right now.:::['4-8-281']
why not? what's going on?:::['4-8-282']
he's trying to show joey how much he means to him.:::['4-8-283']
by being in a box? joey had reasons.:::['4-8-284']
they were threefold.:::['4-8-285']
oh. well, uh......you not being able to talk:::['4-8-286']
might actually make this easier.:::['4-8-287']
i don't wanna be someone who comes between two best friends.:::['4-8-290']
i just... i can't stand seeing what this is doing to you guys.:::['4-8-291']
and i don't wanna be the cause of that. so i don't think we can see each other anymore.:::['4-8-292']
i'm gonna go to my mom's in chicago. i'm gonna stay there for a while.:::['4-8-293']
i think this could have been something really amazing.:::['4-8-294']
but, you know, this is probably for the best.:::['4-8-295']
goodbye, chandler.:::['4-8-298']
open the box.:::['4-8-299']
rachel: what? he can still catch her.:::['4-8-300']
hey, come on. get out of there. get out of there.:::['4-8-301']
so...? yeah, we're gonna be fine. get out.:::['4-8-302']
you did some real good thinking in there.:::['4-8-304']
now go. you could still catch her.:::['4-8-306']
and merry christmas from your secret santa.:::['4-8-307']
all right, who got chandler? because i need to trade.:::['4-8-308']
oh, he sees her.:::['4-8-309']
aw, and he's catching up to her.:::['4-8-310']
oh, she sees him.:::['4-8-311']
oh, they're hugging. rachel: aw.:::['4-8-312']
he's taking her purse.:::['4-8-313']
uh, that's not them. i'm gonna go call the police.:::['4-8-314']
oh, there they are. where?:::['4-8-315']
ah! oh.:::['4-8-316']
all right, get a room.:::['4-8-318']
okay. come on, no peeking.:::['4-9-0']
our eyes are closed, and we're about to cross the street. very good.:::['4-9-1']
okay. open up.:::['4-9-2']
what do you want to show us? because all i can see is this bitchen van.:::['4-9-3']
yeah, it's for our catering business.:::['4-9-4']
chandler: oh. i think i know that girl.:::['4-9-5']
we're not gonna keep it this way, though. no?:::['4-9-6']
we're gonna paint over the sword and replace it with a baguette.:::['4-9-7']
um, also, we don't know what to do with this.:::['4-9-9']
oh, yeah, i definitely know her.:::['4-9-10']
remember that guy from cooking school that put cilantro in everything?:::['4-9-11']
oh, sure, cilantro larry. monica: yeah.:::['4-9-12']
well, i'm gonna fill in for him as food critic for the chelsea reporter.:::['4-9-13']
wow. monica, what an amazing opportunity to influence......dozens of people.:::['4-9-14']
what about our catering business?:::['4-9-15']
oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.:::['4-9-16']
plus, i get to take all of you out for free dinners.:::['4-9-17']
both: hey. phoebe: oh.:::['4-9-18']
well, in that case::::['4-9-19']
that was me hopping onboard. monica: oh.:::['4-9-20']
hey, guys. hey, ross. quick question for you.:::['4-9-21']
are you ready to party?:::['4-9-22']
i don't know, i could maybe go out for a couple of beers.:::['4-9-23']
but there's this thing about bumblebees on the discovery channel.:::['4-9-24']
no, no, no, i don't think you heard me. are you ready to party?:::['4-9-25']
no. gandalf? gandalf is coming to town?:::['4-9-26']
kathy's with her parents, i have nothing to do. tomorrow we are partying with gandalf, dude.:::['4-9-27']

i'm gonna call and get off work tomorrow.:::['4-9-32']
oh. i'm gonna call after you.:::['4-9-33']
this is gonna be so cool. dude, we never party anymore.:::['4-9-34']
both: whoo!:::['4-9-35']
all right, were you guys smoking something in the back of our van?:::['4-9-36']
what do you mean, we never have fun? you have fun with me.:::['4-9-37']
remember the time we saw those strippers and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?:::['4-9-38']
joey, you are gonna love this guy. gandalf is like the party wizard.:::['4-9-39']
well, why do you call him gandalf? gandalf the wizard.:::['4-9-40']
hello? didn't you read lord of the rings in high school?:::['4-9-41']
no, i had sex in high school.:::['4-9-42']
oh. uh, joanna? i was wondering if i could ask you something.:::['4-9-43']
there's an opening for an assistant buyer in junior miss...:::['4-9-44']
okay, but that would be a step down for me.:::['4-9-45']
no, actually, i meant for me.:::['4-9-46']
the hiring committee is meeting people all day and...:::['4-9-47']
oh. well, i wish i could say no, but i guess you can't stay my assistant forever.:::['4-9-48']
neither can you, sophie, but for different reasons.:::['4-9-49']
i'm so glad you don't have a problem with this. if you did, i wouldn't have considered applying.:::['4-9-50']
really? in that case...:::['4-9-51']
and that's why i'm so glad there's no problem.:::['4-9-52']
yeah, it's fine. i'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be one friendly face.:::['4-9-53']
you know, junior miss is where i started. really?:::['4-9-55']
i had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.:::['4-9-56']
really? no. ha, ha.:::['4-9-57']
i mean, no. no, no, no. ha, ha. no. ha, ha.:::['4-9-59']
i'm sure with your qualifications, you won't need to sleep with some guy.:::['4-9-60']
although, uh, i might need some convincing.:::['4-9-62']
um... oh. kidding. ha, ha.:::['4-9-63']
god, i feel wild today. aah!:::['4-9-64']
oh, man, i am so excited, i may vomit.:::['4-9-65']
will you calm down? he's just a human guy.:::['4-9-66']
look, you don't understand. gandalf is amazing.:::['4-9-67']
you never know what's gonna happen.:::['4-9-68']
you go out for a couple of beers and end up on a fishing boat to nova scotia.:::['4-9-69']
really? oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.:::['4-9-70']
hey. okay. i got my passport, fresh socks, and a snakebite kit.:::['4-9-71']
it's not gonna be exactly like last time.:::['4-9-72']
all right, i'll see you guys.:::['4-9-73']
ross & chandler: whoa, whoa, whoa.:::['4-9-74']
i have an audition, but i'll hook up with you later.:::['4-9-75']
where you gonna be around noon? chandler: heh.:::['4-9-76']
somewhere maybe along the equator?:::['4-9-77']
chandler: hello?:::['4-9-79']
it's gandalf.:::['4-9-80']
so are you in town?:::['4-9-81']
oh, well...:::['4-9-82']
well, maybe next time, then.:::['4-9-83']
he's not gonna make it. he's stuck in chicago.:::['4-9-85']
chicago's so lucky.:::['4-9-87']
stupid, useless canadian money.:::['4-9-88']
you have a very impressive résumé, ms. green.:::['4-9-89']
i especially like what i see here about implementing a new filing system.:::['4-9-90']
filing system? oh, you mean those little colored labels you put on all the folders?:::['4-9-92']
it certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.:::['4-9-93']
well, they, uh... they did more than that.:::['4-9-94']
i notice that you've been entrusted with a lot of important responsibilities.:::['4-9-95']
yes. joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.:::['4-9-96']
oh. and rachel has been really incredible at getting my morning bagel.:::['4-9-97']
it's amazing how she gets it right almost every time.:::['4-9-98']
of course, i have more responsibilities than that.:::['4-9-99']
oh, yes, of course. there's the coffee too. rachel can carry two things at once.:::['4-9-100']
that's, uh, very good.:::['4-9-101']
now, a big part of this job......is cultivating personal relationships,especially with designers.:::['4-9-102']
yes, i realize... joanna: rachel shouldn't have any problem.:::['4-9-103']
her only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what i mean.:::['4-9-104']
i love working with designers.:::['4-9-105']
with them, under them, what's the difference, eh, rach?:::['4-9-106']
hey. my first review is out.:::['4-9-107']
oh! oh, the chelsea reporter.:::['4-9-108']
ah. these used to keep me so warm.:::['4-9-109']
all right, look, i'm on the back page. ooh. oh!:::['4-9-110']
okay. "would i go back to allesandro's? sure, but i would have to order two meals.:::['4-9-111']
one for me, and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head.":::['4-9-112']
wow, you really laid into this place.:::['4-9-113']
hey, they don't pay me a penny a word to make friends.:::['4-9-114']
ooh, i gotta go. i found a guy who could fix up the van for catering.:::['4-9-115']
oh. you want me to go with you? no, no, it's okay.:::['4-9-116']
but are we sure we don't want the waterbed?:::['4-9-117']
haven't we made this decision? yeah, all right.:::['4-9-118']
who is it? it's allesandro, from allesandro's.:::['4-9-120']
oh, my god. man: i wanna talk to you about your review. oh, my god. oh, my god.:::['4-9-121']
call me on the phone.:::['4-9-122']
man: what, so you can hang up on me?:::['4-9-123']
i'm never gonna let you up, so you may as well just go away.:::['4-9-124']
man: just give me a chance to... do you need to get in? here you go.:::['4-9-125']
no, phoebe! phoebe: oh, hey, monica.:::['4-9-126']
i want a retraction. our food is not "inedible swill.":::['4-9-127']
i couldn't eat it.:::['4-9-128']
i have five friends who couldn't eat it, and one of them eats books.:::['4-9-129']
well, our service is not "grossly incompetent.":::['4-9-130']
the waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants.:::['4-9-131']
well, you said that we accept the discover card......which we do not.:::['4-9-132']
all right, that i'll retract.:::['4-9-133']
but i stand by my review. i know food, and that wasn't it.:::['4-9-134']
your marinara sauce tastes like tomato juice.:::['4-9-135']
you should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.:::['4-9-136']
hey, i'm proud of that sauce. it's delicious.:::['4-9-137']
oh, my god. you own an italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?:::['4-9-138']
where are you even from?:::['4-9-139']
lebanon.:::['4-9-140']
hand me those tomatoes.:::['4-9-141']
i'm gonna show you what it should taste like. come on, hand them to me.:::['4-9-142']
how long is this gonna take? i got another critic i gotta go yell at.:::['4-9-143']
ahem. uh, joanna, i wanna talk about that interview.:::['4-9-144']
i thought it went very well.:::['4-9-145']
no, it didn't. that's what i wanna talk to you about.:::['4-9-146']
now, just to brief you......i may cry.:::['4-9-147']
but they are not tears of sadness or of anger......but just of me having this discussion:::['4-9-148']
rachel, please, don't make a scene.:::['4-9-150']
there's nobody here.:::['4-9-151']
sophie, get in here.:::['4-9-152']
you see? now you're making sophie uncomfortable.:::['4-9-153']
she's not making me uncomfortable.:::['4-9-154']
congratulations, you've just crossed the line into completely useless. get out.:::['4-9-155']
do you want me to quit?:::['4-9-156']
what? what would make you think that?:::['4-9-157']
well, all of those things you said in the interview.:::['4-9-158']
if you believe any of them, i must not be a very good assistant.:::['4-9-159']
i am just going to pack up my desk......and i will be gone:::['4-9-161']
by the end of the day.:::['4-9-162']
well, i guess there's no use me sticking around till the end of the day.:::['4-9-163']
you can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer.:::['4-9-165']
if you must know the truth, i didn't wanna lose a good assistant.:::['4-9-166']
that's why i said all those things about your flirting and your drinking.:::['4-9-168']
my drinking?:::['4-9-169']
oh. i must have said that after you left.:::['4-9-170']
said what, exactly?:::['4-9-171']
that you enjoy the occasional drink......- ing binge.:::['4-9-172']
oh, my god. oh. that is it. i'm leaving.:::['4-9-173']
you are just a horrible person. no, wait, wait, wait.:::['4-9-174']
now, if you're gonna get all sensitive about it.:::['4-9-175']
i don't want to lose you.:::['4-9-176']
what if i create a position for you?:::['4-9-177']
i'll make you assistant buyer in this department.:::['4-9-178']
say more things like that. um...:::['4-9-179']
you can have your own office and a raise, effective tomorrow.:::['4-9-180']
i'd need an expense account. done.:::['4-9-181']
and an assistant. sophie, get in here.:::['4-9-182']
now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it? starting from...:::['4-9-183']
hey, what are you guys doing here?:::['4-9-184']
i thought you'd be partying with gandoldorf.:::['4-9-185']
it's gandalf, and he's not coming.:::['4-9-186']
so you've been sitting here all morning? no.:::['4-9-187']
i balanced my checkbook.:::['4-9-188']
yeah, and i gave first names to all the foosball players.:::['4-9-189']
i can't believe he didn't come.:::['4-9-190']
so what if he didn't come? we can still go out and party ourselves.:::['4-9-191']
oh, no, you know, with gandalf, we'd be out all night.:::['4-9-192']
yeah, we'd meet total strangers and hang out with them.:::['4-9-193']
well, we could do that.:::['4-9-194']
there was other stuff too.:::['4-9-195']
we'll do it all, and better.:::['4-9-196']
look, after tonight, gandalf will wanna party with us, dude. come on.:::['4-9-197']
yeah. joey: yeah.:::['4-9-198']
it's not like we don't know how to party. yeah. all right. let's go.:::['4-9-199']
and maybe we could end up on a boat again?:::['4-9-200']
both: yeah! all right!:::['4-9-201']
hey, hey, hey. when were we on a boat?:::['4-9-203']
remember that really cold morning... ...when you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?:::['4-9-204']
ross: yeah. those were seals, man.:::['4-9-205']
hey, how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer...?:::['4-9-206']
the owner of allesandro's came to yell at me......but i made him some sauce,and he offered me the job as head chef.:::['4-9-207']
oh, my god. you just ruined the thing i was practicing the whole way home, but i'm so happy.:::['4-9-208']
can you believe it? i finally get to run my own kitchen.:::['4-9-209']
oh, you've waited so long.:::['4-9-210']
monica: ha, ha, oh. rachel: oh.:::['4-9-211']
hey. hey, pheebs. quick question for you.:::['4-9-212']
how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at bloomingdale's?:::['4-9-213']
i don't know. it would totally depend on her coloring and...:::['4-9-214']
you got the job! rachel: yes!:::['4-9-215']
oh! you got the job? why didn't you tell me?:::['4-9-216']
oh. it's gonna be so great. i'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.:::['4-9-217']
i'm gonna have an office with walls and everything.:::['4-9-218']
i'm gonna have walls. monica: aw.:::['4-9-219']
is this the day of good news or what? i got us a job.:::['4-9-220']
the wedding reception.:::['4-9-221']
um, phoebe, i kind of need to talk to you about that.:::['4-9-223']
well, i think it might be time for me to take a step back from the catering.:::['4-9-225']
but we've only had one job. tsk.:::['4-9-226']
i know, but now we have this second one, and it just feels like it's snowballing.:::['4-9-227']
yeah, what are you saying?:::['4-9-228']
i got offered the head-chef job at allesandro's.:::['4-9-229']
what? it's okay, you don't really need me.:::['4-9-230']
you're the cook.:::['4-9-231']
without you, it's just me driving up to people's houses......with empty trays and asking for money.:::['4-9-232']
all right. but, um, well, i'll pay you back all the money you invested.:::['4-9-233']
and you can keep the van. for what?:::['4-9-234']
i can't believe this. i gotta get out of here.:::['4-9-235']
phoebe, wait a minute.:::['4-9-236']
i'm an assistant buyer!:::['4-9-237']
all right, we'll get a little coffee, get energized, then we'll head back out.:::['4-9-238']
yeah, all right. okay.:::['4-9-239']
so we're having fun, right? we don't need that wizard guy.:::['4-9-240']
we hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers......then after this, we'll go down:::['4-9-241']
to the docks and see about that boat thing.:::['4-9-242']
i'm kind of beat.:::['4-9-243']
actually......me too.:::['4-9-244']
joey: are you serious?:::['4-9-245']
ross & chandler: yeah.:::['4-9-246']
thank god. i'm exhausted.:::['4-9-247']
so you guys want coffees?:::['4-9-248']
yeah, but i don't wanna be up too late, so i'll have a decaf.:::['4-9-249']
actually, could i get some hot water with a little lemon?:::['4-9-251']
i strained my voice screaming in there. does it have to be so loud?:::['4-9-252']
oh. i can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.:::['4-9-253']
huh. i was glad i brought that extra pair of socks, you know?:::['4-9-254']
i used them as mittens.:::['4-9-255']
i didn't wanna touch a thing in that last place.:::['4-9-256']
how sad are we?:::['4-9-258']
you know what? we're not sad.:::['4-9-260']
we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore, you know?:::['4-9-261']
i'm 29 years old, damn it.:::['4-9-262']
i wanna sit in a comfortable chair, watch television......and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.:::['4-9-263']
yeah, and i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends.:::['4-9-265']
and so what if i like to go home, throw on some kenny g, and take a bath?:::['4-9-267']
we're 29. we're not women.:::['4-9-268']
oh. there you are.:::['4-9-269']
hey, i'm glad that you decided to hear me out.:::['4-9-270']
okay, i'm hearing.:::['4-9-271']
i've been doing a lot of thinking. a lot.:::['4-9-272']
and, well, i came up with a whole bunch of businesses that you can do with your van.:::['4-9-273']
you could be a flower delivery person. what?:::['4-9-275']
or a bakery delivery person.:::['4-9-276']
pizza?:::['4-9-277', '3-16-253']
all right, i got a whole bunch of stuff in this area......but i'm getting the feeling:::['4-9-279']
you don't wanna deliver.:::['4-9-280']
i'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver......you probably don't wanna:::['4-9-282']
pick up stuff either.:::['4-9-283']
let's do the catering business. really? are you sure?:::['4-9-286']
yeah. you know, i made a commitment to you.:::['4-9-287']
know what? lt'd be fun. oh, it will be fun.:::['4-9-288']
oh. yay! aw.:::['4-9-289']
okay. ooh, let's plan the wedding reception. okay.:::['4-9-290']
you really wanted me to do something with this van.:::['4-9-292']
you know what? i want you to take the chefjob.:::['4-9-293']
really? phoebe: yeah.:::['4-9-294']
that's what you really want.:::['4-9-295']
yeah, i don't wanna be the reason you're unhappy. that would make me unhappy.:::['4-9-296']
and i really don't wanna be the reason i'm unhappy.:::['4-9-297']
besides, it might be kind of fun to form the new a-team.:::['4-9-299']
oh, hi, mrs. lynch. is joanna in already?:::['4-9-300']
oh, my goodness. you haven't heard.:::['4-9-301']
heard what?:::['4-9-302']
joanna passed away last night.:::['4-9-303']
oh, my god. how?:::['4-9-304']
well, she was leaving work, and she was hit by a cab.:::['4-9-305']
oh, my god. oh, i cannot believe it.:::['4-9-306']
i know. oh, god.:::['4-9-307']
i didn't realize that you were so close.:::['4-9-309']
yes. so close.:::['4-9-310']
mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.:::['4-9-311']
but by any chance, did joanna send any paperwork your way......before it happened?:::['4-9-312']
imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb a few seconds later...:::['4-9-314']
oh. yes, yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us.:::['4-9-315']
nothing about an assistant buyer?:::['4-9-316']
i'm sorry. i have to go.:::['4-9-317']
oh, sophie, i guess you didn't hear about joanna.:::['4-9-319']
i sure did.:::['4-9-320']
i'm so excited about having monica come onboard with us.:::['4-9-321']
although i do feel bad about having fired chef emilio.:::['4-9-322']
it is like losing a member of the family.:::['4-9-323']
of course, that literally is the case for several of you.:::['4-9-324']
tony, carlos, marie......please tell your father:::['4-9-325']
how much we're going to miss him.:::['4-9-326']
now, i know that monica has a lot of great ideas for this place.:::['4-9-327']
well, you all read the review. ha, ha.:::['4-9-328']
so without much further ado......i present to you our new head chef.:::['4-9-329']
um, i just wanna say, uh, that with a pinch of excitement......a dash of hard work,and a dollop of cooperation......we can have the recipe...:::['4-9-330']
are you going to kill me?:::['4-9-331']
what the hell is that? is that you?:::['4-12-1']
boy, you're really not a morning person. just back off!:::['4-12-2']
get up! get up! get up!:::['4-12-3']
what is that noise?:::['4-12-4']
it's the chick.:::['4-12-6']
she's going through some changes.:::['4-12-7']
what kind of changes?:::['4-12-8']
well, the vet seems to think that she's becoming a rooster.:::['4-12-9']
we're getting a second opinion.:::['4-12-10']
hey, what are you doing shopping at 8 in the morning?:::['4-12-11']
well, i've been up since 6......thanks to somebody's:::['4-12-12']
dumb-ass rooster.:::['4-12-13']
you guys, you really should get rid of those animals. they shouldn't be in an apartment.:::['4-12-14']
yeah, especially not with all these knives and cookbooks around.:::['4-12-15']
all right, i'm gonna go to the fertility doctor and, uh, see if i'm ready......to have frank and alice's embryo:::['4-12-16']
transferred into my uterus.:::['4-12-17']
now, how will they know if you're ready?:::['4-12-18']
oh, they're just gonna look and see if my endometrial layer is thick.:::['4-12-19']
oh, i can check that for you.:::['4-12-20']
okay, everyone, think "thick.":::['4-12-21']
group: good luck.:::['4-12-22']
phoebe: hey. wish me luck. both: hey.:::['4-12-23']
oh, good luck. good luck.:::['4-12-24']
and i'm still right. that is so not true.:::['4-12-25']
she's mad because i know today's her laundry day......and that means she's wearing:::['4-12-27']
her old-lady underpants.:::['4-12-28']
i can check that for you.:::['4-12-29']
i just can't believe that you think that you and chandler know me and rachel... ...better than we know you.:::['4-12-30']
well, we do.:::['4-12-31']
you can only eat tic tacs in even numbers.:::['4-12-32']
yeah, what's that about?:::['4-12-33']
and you. ross, i believe if you check rachel's bag......you will find a half-eaten box:::['4-12-34']
of cookies in there.:::['4-12-35']
these are not.:::['4-12-37']
i'm so not impressed. everybody snacks when they shop.:::['4-12-38']
yeah. joey: oh, yeah? ross, how many items left in that bag?:::['4-12-39']
five. okay.:::['4-12-40']
ten bucks says that we can name every item in that bag.:::['4-12-41']
how many guesses do you get? six.:::['4-12-42']
challenge extended.:::['4-12-43']
deal. challenge accepted.:::['4-12-44']
all right, we'll start with... ...apples.:::['4-12-45']
we'll be starting with apples.:::['4-12-46']
stop that now.:::['4-12-47']
okay. uh, tortilla chips.:::['4-12-49']
yogurt. diet soda.:::['4-12-50']
yes, yes, yes.:::['4-12-51', '4-16-13']
orange juice. no, there's no orange juice in there. we win. ha, ha.:::['4-12-52']
they have another guess.:::['4-12-53']
okay, well, we won that one.:::['4-12-54']
okay. the last thing is...:::['4-12-55']
ooh, ooh, ooh.:::['4-12-56']
no, no. not for, like, another two weeks.:::['4-12-57']
i got it. scotch......tape.:::['4-12-58']
how did you know she would buy scotch tape?:::['4-12-59']
well, we used up theirs last night making scary faces.:::['4-12-60']
all right. ten bucks. fork it over. cough it up. pay the piper.:::['4-12-62']
give me it.:::['4-12-63']
that does not mean you know us better. i want a rematch.:::['4-12-64']
yeah, and none of these stupid grocery questions. real personal questions.:::['4-12-65']
yeah. and the winner gets 100 bucks.:::['4-12-66']
serious?:::['4-12-67']
are you scared?:::['4-12-68']
okay, who makes up the questions?:::['4-12-70']
ross will do it.:::['4-12-71']
oh, sure, ross will do it.:::['4-12-72']
it's not like he has a job or a child or a life of his own.:::['4-12-73']
well, fine. we'll ask phoebe.:::['4-12-74']
no, no, no, i wanna play.:::['4-12-75']
looks like your uterus is ready for implantation.:::['4-12-76']
oh, i knew it. i knew it. i felt really thick this morning.:::['4-12-77']
ha, ha. okay, so, what's now? go get the eggs. put them in there.:::['4-12-78']
okay. it'll take just a little while to prepare the embryos.:::['4-12-79']
embryos? as in more than one? mm-hm. five, actually.:::['4-12-80']
five? okay, where am i giving birth... ...in a hospital or a big box under the stairs?:::['4-12-81']
ha, ha. we do five because that gives you a 25-percent chance... ...that at least one will attach.:::['4-12-82']
that's it? twenty-five percent?:::['4-12-83']
that means that it's, like, 75-percent chance of no baby at all?:::['4-12-84']
yeah, you know, i was thinking, what are the odds... ...if, like, you stuff, like, 200 of them in there?:::['4-12-85']
sweetie, now... ...she's a woman, not a gumball machine.:::['4-12-86']
okay, well, you know what? don't worry. i'm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.:::['4-12-87']
well, see, the thing is, we kind of only have one shot.:::['4-12-88']
um, it costs $16,000 each time you do this.:::['4-12-89']
so, um, we're kind of using all the money we have to do it just this one time.:::['4-12-90']

so, um, you feel like taking a test? there's only one question.:::['4-12-295']
all right. i will. no, i will.:::['4-12-296']
but, um, you know, just remember that it's still really early.:::['4-12-297']
okay, so if it says that i'm not pregnant... ...that doesn't mean i'm not gonna get pregnant, okay?:::['4-12-298']

i can't find garbage bags.:::['4-12-313']
oh, i think i saw some in here.:::['4-12-314']
i don't know. but maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it'll die.:::['4-12-316']
i can't believe we're living here.:::['4-12-317']
what? what is it?:::['4-12-318', '4-1-115', '4-1-123']
did you see the size of the closets?:::['4-12-319']
i can't believe we live here.:::['4-12-320']
okay, she is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.:::['4-13-0']
i get to have sex with the star of the play.:::['4-13-1']
people can hear you. i know.:::['4-13-2']
wow, she looks great, doesn't she? mm.:::['4-13-3']
man: hi. kathy: hi.:::['4-13-4']
that is one good-looking man.:::['4-13-5']
ls it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?:::['4-13-6']
man: so, you been doing this long?:::['4-13-7']
kathy: no. you're my first. put the money on the table.:::['4-13-8']
man: oh, yeah.:::['4-13-9']
ooh, that's nice.:::['4-13-10']
man: ls that an expensive blouse? kathy: if you want it to be.:::['4-13-12']
here's your girlfriend's button.:::['4-13-13']
oh, hey, mon, do you still have, like, your old blouses and dresses from high school?:::['4-13-14']
yeah, i think i have some around here somewhere. why?:::['4-13-15']
well, it's just maternity clothes are so expensive.:::['4-13-16']
monica: hey, rach, i made a pile of your stuff on this side of your room.:::['4-13-17']
if you could just-- ugh!:::['4-13-18']
throw your purses at it.:::['4-13-19']
bloomingdale's eliminated my department.:::['4-13-20']
oh, my god. are you out of a job? no, they stuck me in personal shopping... ...which is just a huge step doen.:::['4-13-21']
personal shopping, ehat is that?:::['4-13-22']
like ehere you walk around with snooty rich people......and tell them what to buy?:::['4-13-23']
uh-huh. that sounds great.:::['4-13-24']
um, excuse me, we seitched apartments.:::['4-13-26']
you can't eat our food anymore. that gravy train has ended.:::['4-13-27']
there's gravy?:::['4-13-28']
if you have the big apartment, then deal with people coming over all the time.:::['4-13-29']
that fridge has got to be stocked, okay? that's your apartment noe.:::['4-13-30']
what are you doing? joey: i think i left a doughnut up here.:::['4-13-31']
oh, how was kathy's play?:::['4-13-33']
well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex... ...with a real good-looking guy.:::['4-13-34']
yeah, it was like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare......and then charged me $32 to see it.:::['4-13-35']
that's a good idea for a business.:::['4-13-36']
i'm totally screeed, okay? they're gonna be hot and heavy on-stage every night......and then they're gonna go to their:::['4-13-37']
cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.:::['4-13-38']
you know, he'll be like, "so ehere's your boyfriend? what's his name, chester?":::['4-13-39']
and she'll go, "no, no, no. it's chandler." he'll go, "whatever. ha-ha-ha.":::['4-13-40']
that is a good trick.:::['4-13-41']
all right, look, look. what am i gonna do?:::['4-13-42']
chandler, look, they're actors. they're there to do a job.:::['4-13-43']
just because they eork together doesn't mean they'll get together.:::['4-13-44']
just because it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins... ...doesn't mean it's gonna happen with them.:::['4-13-45']
oh, oh. alec baldwin and kim basinger.:::['4-13-46']
tom cruise and nicole kidman. yeah.:::['4-13-47']
okay, mel gibson and clint eastwood.:::['4-13-48']
they're not a couple.:::['4-13-49']
oh, okay, i get the game now.:::['4-13-50']
okay, look, look. let me ask you a question.:::['4-13-51']
when they eere doing it on-stage, was it like really hot?:::['4-13-52']
huh. oh, yeah.:::['4-13-53']
well, okay, so then you're fine.:::['4-13-54']
look, the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage......then all the sexual tension:::['4-13-55']
between them is gone.:::['4-13-56']
okay? so as long as it's hot on-stage, you got nothing to worry about.:::['4-13-57']
it's when the heat goes aeay, that's when you're in trouble.:::['4-13-58']
you guys have been to every play i've been in. have i ever had chemistry on-stage?:::['4-13-60']
group: no. no.:::['4-13-61']
so, uh, man, are you gonna go see the play with me tonight?:::['4-13-62']
you know what? i don't know hoe comfortable i am......going to see hoe hot the sex is:::['4-13-63']
between some guy and your girlfriend.:::['4-13-64']
yeah, i knoe-- no, no, no, oh, i'm there.:::['4-13-65']
hey. joey: hey, mon.:::['4-13-66']

yep. grab a plate.:::['4-13-68']
no, no. stay right there.:::['4-13-69']
getting closer.:::['4-13-70']
chandler: don't worry... ...we also have cereals, muffins, eaffles......and jams, jellies and marmalades,which i'm fairly certain are the same thing.:::['4-13-71']
also we're eatching the game here saturday, if people want to come over.:::['4-13-72']
oh, yeah. monica: oh.:::['4-13-73']
i was having people over for the game. oh, yeah? who's playing?:::['4-13-74']

all right. pheebs, stick out your plate.:::['4-13-78']

i mean, even ehen i was little, the girls brought their dollies to my tea party.:::['4-13-160']
i served the best air.:::['4-13-161']
why did you make a whole big thing... ...out of everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?:::['4-13-162']
because they took our apartment. i wanted to punish them.:::['4-13-163']
but i'm done noe. they've suffered enough.:::['4-13-164']
if you wanted to punish them, you should have just made them hang out here. that's true.:::['4-13-165']
all right, this place eill be 10 times better than that place.:::['4-13-166']
oh, are we gonna trash their place?:::['4-13-167']

i confronted her, and she didn't deny it.:::['4-13-172']
i don't live here.:::['4-13-173']
chandler. chandler, what did she say?:::['4-13-174']

oh, i just feel bad. i never vacuum.:::['4-13-182']
so i was eith joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out.:::['4-13-184']
it's so frustrating. why don't you ask him out?:::['4-13-185']
oh, yeah. totally. that's such a turn-on.:::['4-13-186']
really? it doesn't seem desperate?:::['4-13-187']
ooh, that's the turn-on.:::['4-13-188']
he just got a divorce, right? so he's probably really nervous around women.:::['4-13-189']
you know? maybe you just need to make the first move.:::['4-13-190']
i've never asked a guy out before. you've never asked a guy out?:::['4-13-191']
no, have you? thousands of times. ha, ha.:::['4-13-192']
that doesn't make me sound too good, does it?:::['4-13-193']
i don't even know hoe i would go about it.:::['4-13-194']
oh, what i do is, uh, i look a woman up and down and i say::::['4-13-195']
"hey.:::['4-13-196']
hoe you doing?":::['4-13-197']
hoe you doing?:::['4-13-200', '4-13-321', '4-14-238']

you've done that a thousand times? i've never done that.:::['4-13-213']
oh, god, i just got so nervous that he was gonna say no.:::['4-13-214']
well, you gotta give him something he can't say no to, like, uh, knicks tickets.:::['4-13-215']

forget her, man. you don't need her. don't need that.:::['4-13-222']
he's right. what she did was unforgivable.:::['4-13-223']
well, yeah, but you know, what if i was wrong?:::['4-13-224']
hoe might you be wrong?:::['4-13-225']
well, you know, what if she didn't actually sleep with the guy?:::['4-13-226']

lone gunman, communism, geometry.:::['4-13-233']
"would you like to go to a basketball game eith--":::['4-13-235']

you know, i mean, i know for me, but--:::['4-13-268']
nick's pants?:::['4-13-269']

oh, good. she is now.:::['4-13-295']
what are you saying? i'm saying that she is a devil eoman.:::['4-13-296']
you think you know a person... ...then they turn around and they sleep with nick.:::['4-13-297']
nick and his rock-hard pecs and his giant man-nipples.:::['4-13-298']
i hate him. and i hate her.:::['4-13-299']
well, i don't hate her. i love her. this is all my fault, really.:::['4-13-300']
oh. hoe? hoe is it your fault?:::['4-13-301']
because, ugh, i should have called.:::['4-13-302']
you know, if i'd just called her, she never would have gone out eith nick......and they wouldn't have ended up:::['4-13-303']
in bed together.:::['4-13-304']
i three her at his man-nipples.:::['4-13-305']
honey, this is not your fault.:::['4-13-306']
just because you guys had a fight does not justify her sleeping with someone.:::['4-13-307']
well, if she thought they were on a break....:::['4-13-308']
rachel, one of your customers seems to have left his billfold. a joshua burgen.:::['4-13-309']
really? will you call him?:::['4-13-310']
yes, i will. absolutely.:::['4-13-311']
hello, rachel.:::['4-13-313', '4-3-24']
hi, joshua.:::['4-13-314']
i left my eallet here on purpose.:::['4-13-315']
yes, i just wanted to see you again.:::['4-13-317']
oh, i'm glad.:::['4-13-318']
rachel, i'd like to say something to you.:::['4-13-319']
i can't believe my little brother's married!:::['4-11-0']
why didn't you tell me you were eloping?:::['4-11-1']
well, we were at court, eating lunch...:::['4-11-2']
why were you at court?:::['4-11-3']
lunch.:::['4-11-4']
we were like......we're here, we're having lunch.:::['4-11-5']
let's get married! right?:::['4-11-6']
a year ago, i didn't know i had a brother. now i have a sister!:::['4-11-7']
phoebe: oh, it's so great.:::['4-11-8']
stop it! don't!:::['4-11-10']
i'll get you a gift now.:::['4-11-11']
is there anything you need?:::['4-11-12']
we've been trying to get pregnant. thought we'd get a jump on things.:::['4-11-14']
no one's getting any younger. ha-ha-ha.:::['4-11-15']
because the thing is, um, we're not able to, you know, uh, conceive.:::['4-11-16']
we've seen a bunch of doctors.:::['4-11-17']
they say that our only chance to have a baby......is that if they take my sperm,her egg, put it together in a dish......and put it into another girl.:::['4-11-18']
we were wondering if you could be that girl.:::['4-11-19']
that's a really nice gift.:::['4-11-20']
i was thinking of a gravy boat.:::['4-11-21']
check it out! guess what job i just got.:::['4-11-22']
i don't know, but donald trump wants his blue blazer black.:::['4-11-23']
blue blazer back. he wants it back.:::['4-11-25']
you said "black." why would he want his blue blazer black?:::['4-11-26']
well, you know what i meant.:::['4-11-27']
you messed it up.:::['4-11-28']
you're stupid.:::['4-11-29']
so what job'd you get?:::['4-11-30']
tour guide at the museum. ross got it for me.:::['4-11-31']
don't you have to be a dinosaur expert?:::['4-11-32']
they give you all the information.:::['4-11-33']
it's like memorizing a script.:::['4-11-34']
on your left, tyrannosaurus rex, from the jurassic period.:::['4-11-35']
yeah, actually, joey, it's the cretaceous period.:::['4-11-37']
but i can pronounce jurassic.:::['4-11-38']
frank jr. and alice got married!:::['4-11-40']
they're having a baby!:::['4-11-42']
they want me to grow it for them in my uterus!:::['4-11-43']
my god! are you serious?:::['4-11-44']
you're thinking of having sex with your brother?:::['4-11-46']
ew! and, oh, no!:::['4-11-47']
they want me to be the surrogate.:::['4-11-48']
it's her egg and his sperm. i'm the oven. it's their bun.:::['4-11-49']
i had to think about it, but what is there to think of?:::['4-11-51']
i'll be giving someone the greatest gift.:::['4-11-52']
you'll carry their child, and get them a sony playstation?:::['4-11-53']
this is an incredible thing to do.:::['4-11-54']
but there are things to think about.:::['4-11-55']
yeah, you'd be pregnant. i mean pregnant.:::['4-11-56']
you'll put your body through an awful lot.:::['4-11-58']
i mean, morning sickness, uh, labor.:::['4-11-59']
it's all for somebody else.:::['4-11-60']
yeah. what's your point?:::['4-11-61']
well, the stuff i just mentioned.:::['4-11-62']
i couldn't do that.:::['4-11-63']
i figure, the first time i had a baby, it'd be with someone i love.:::['4-11-64']
and that baby was, you know......a keeper.:::['4-11-65']
you were more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture.:::['4-11-66']
if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.:::['4-11-67']
just think it through.:::['4-11-68']
talk to somebody who's had a baby. like your mom.:::['4-11-69']
my mom never gave birth. oh! but my birth mom did!:::['4-11-70']
i love this tushy! can i take it to work with me?:::['4-11-71']
yeah, sure. it's not mine anyway. it came with the pants.:::['4-11-72']
monica: i am so jealous.:::['4-11-73']
you guys are just right there.:::['4-11-74']
right where?:::['4-11-76']
the beginning, where it's all sex and talking......and sex and talking.:::['4-11-77']
you got to love the talking.:::['4-11-78']
and the sex?:::['4-11-79']
we haven't had sex.:::['4-11-80']
what's the big deal? this is special.:::['4-11-81']
i want our love to grow before moving to the next level.:::['4-11-82']
oh, chandler, that is so nice.:::['4-11-83']
that is really nice......lying!:::['4-11-84']
no way is that the reason. why?:::['4-11-85']
you're not mature enough to understand that!:::['4-11-86']
he's right. i'm totally lying.:::['4-11-87']
then what is it?:::['4-11-88']
kathy's last boyfriend was joey.:::['4-11-89']
and you're afraid you won't be able to fill his shoes?:::['4-11-90']
i'm afraid i won't make love as well as him.:::['4-11-91']
i was going for the metaphor.:::['4-11-92']
i was saying the actual words.:::['4-11-93']
he's had girlfriends. it doesn't mean he's great in bed.:::['4-11-94']
we share a wall.:::['4-11-95']
either he's great, or she liked to agree with him a lot.:::['4-11-96']
it'll be different. the sex will be great because you are in love.:::['4-11-97']
yeah? rachel: yeah.:::['4-11-98']
just go for it.:::['4-11-99']
yeah, you should.:::['4-11-100']
all right. i'll sleep with my girlfriend.:::['4-11-101']
but i'm just doing it for you guys.:::['4-11-102']
now, the mastodon is from the semi-late jurassic period.:::['4-11-103']
isn't the mastodon from the pliocene epoch?:::['4-11-104']
this is a museum. no talking.:::['4-11-106']
right down here we have......a large foot.:::['4-11-107']
and over here we have ross geller.:::['4-11-108']
everyone wave "hi" to ross.:::['4-11-109']
ross is one of our scientists. look at him hard at work.:::['4-11-110']
okay, moving right along.:::['4-11-111']
it's open. come in.:::['4-11-113']
i'm sorry i'm late. that's okay.:::['4-11-114']
i had time to finish glazing my nipples.:::['4-11-115']
you go all out when you're expecting company.:::['4-11-116']
i was working on my pottery.:::['4-11-117']
oh! i didn't know that you did pot.:::['4-11-119']
mostly nudes. it combines my two passions: pottery and erotica.:::['4-11-120']
erottery!:::['4-11-121']
hey! okay!:::['4-11-122']
thanks for coming out to see me.:::['4-11-123']
i thought it'd be a good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person.:::['4-11-124']
i don't think it's a good idea.:::['4-11-125']
you'd be giving up a baby.:::['4-11-127']
and i really don't...:::['4-11-128']
i don't know if anything i say... ...would make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.:::['4-11-129']
no, no, i understand the pain. don't hurt the puppy!:::['4-11-131']
no, no. the puppy is yours.:::['4-11-132']
i get a puppy?:::['4-11-133']
but for only three days.:::['4-11-134']
i realize i don't have any right to start getting parenty on you now.:::['4-11-136']
look at me and not the puppy. it's very important.:::['4-11-137']
i know what i'm talking about.:::['4-11-138']
i gave up two babies.:::['4-11-139']
i only wish i had someone who'd given up babies that told me......how terrible it is.:::['4-11-140']
it'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.:::['4-11-141']
so however hard it is for you to give up this puppy......it'd be a million times harder:::['4-11-142']
to give up a child.:::['4-11-143']
i shouldn't have given you the puppy first.:::['4-11-144']
could you sit there? i'm saving this seat for my friend ross.:::['4-11-145']
you mean dr. geller?:::['4-11-146']
doctor? i didn't know he had a nickname.:::['4-11-147']
oh, he won't sit here.:::['4-11-148']
only people in white coats sit there.:::['4-11-149']
only people in blue blazers sit here.:::['4-11-150']
that's how it is.:::['4-11-152']
it's crazy in a perfect world: a world without lab coats and blazers.:::['4-11-154']
but you not in a perfect world. you in a museum now.:::['4-11-155']
see that scientist?:::['4-11-156']
he and i used to play together in grade school, but now...:::['4-11-157']
peter! hey, peter!:::['4-11-158']
it's me, rhonda from p.s. 129?:::['4-11-159']
i shared my pudding with you, man!:::['4-11-160']
i gave you my snack pack!:::['4-11-161']
see? he pretend he don't even hear me!:::['4-11-162']
everyone's pretending they don't hear you.:::['4-11-163']
i don't know about your jackets and separate tables......but ross is my friend.:::['4-11-164']
and if i save him a seat, he will sit in it.:::['4-11-165']
ross. ross. here! i saved you a seat!:::['4-11-166']
i'm cool here. i'll catch up with you later.:::['4-11-167']
this is saved.:::['4-11-168']
gift shop.:::['4-11-169']
i'm sorry about what happened today.:::['4-11-170']
you do what you got to do.:::['4-11-171']
the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.:::['4-11-172']
it's like that everywhere. mon, back me up.:::['4-11-173']
where you work, the waiters eat with the waiters.:::['4-11-174']
and the chefs eat with the other chefs?:::['4-11-175']
i eat by myself in the alley, because everybody hates me.:::['4-11-176']
you wear a white coat. i wear a blue blazer.:::['4-11-179']
if that means we can't be friends at work, so be it.:::['4-11-180']
i understand, you know?:::['4-11-181']
when i'm in a play and you're in the audience, i don't talk to you.:::['4-11-182']
so it's, you know, it's, uh, cool.:::['4-11-183']
i'll see you tomorrow.:::['4-11-184']
when we're in the audience, he does wave.:::['4-11-185']
why's phoebe singing to karl malden?:::['4-11-187']
i think it's time for puppy to go out again.:::['4-11-188']
come on, let's go to the balcony. what?:::['4-11-189']
the street. come on, let's go to the street.:::['4-11-190']
don't go on the balcony until after i get back.:::['4-11-191']
so did you do it?:::['4-11-192']
yes, yes, we had the sex.:::['4-11-193']
uh-oh. it was bad?:::['4-11-194']
it was fine, but she didn't agree with me as strongly as with joey.:::['4-11-195']
she was like, uh, "i see your point. i'm all right with it.":::['4-11-196']
there's not always a lot of agreement the first time.:::['4-11-197']
yeah. not for girls, anyway. guys agree like that.:::['4-11-198']
look, you have to help me.:::['4-11-199']
i know what to do with a woman. it's always nice.:::['4-11-201']
i need to know......what makes it go from nice to......"my god! somebody's killing her:::['4-11-202']
in there!":::['4-11-203']
i'll show you something a lot of guys don't know.:::['4-11-204']
now.:::['4-11-206']
you don't have to draw an actual... whoa, she's hot!:::['4-11-207']
everyone knows the erogenous zones.:::['4-11-208']
you got one, two, three......four......five, six and seven.:::['4-11-209']
that's one?:::['4-11-213']
kind of an important one.:::['4-11-214']
well, you know sometimes that helps.:::['4-11-216']
most guys will hit one, two, three and then go to seven and set up camp.:::['4-11-217']
that's bad?:::['4-11-218']
at disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the matterhorn.:::['4-11-219']
you might if it were like seven.:::['4-11-220']
the important thing is to take your time.:::['4-11-221']
you want to hit them all......mix them up.:::['4-11-222']
keep them on their toes.:::['4-11-223']
oh, toes!:::['4-11-224']
for some people.:::['4-11-225']
monica: all right.:::['4-11-226']
you could, uh, start out with a little one.:::['4-11-227']
a two.:::['4-11-228']
a one, two, three.:::['4-11-229']
a three.:::['4-11-230']
a five.:::['4-11-231']
a four.:::['4-11-232']
a three, two.:::['4-11-233']
two. a two, four, six.:::['4-11-234']
two, four, six.:::['4-11-235']
four. two.:::['4-11-236']
two. four, seven!:::['4-11-237']
five, seven! six, seven!:::['4-11-238']
seven! seven!:::['4-11-239']
seven, seven, seven!:::['4-11-240']
seven!:::['4-11-241']

here in the middle.:::['4-11-245']
i'm eating......right here:::['4-11-246']
with my good friend, joey.:::['4-11-247']
if he'll sit with me.:::['4-11-248']
i will sit with you, dr. geller.:::['4-11-249']
you know......we work in a museum:::['4-11-250']
of natural history.:::['4-11-251']
and yet, there is something......unnatural......about the way we eat lunch.:::['4-11-252']
i look around, and you know what i see? i see division.:::['4-11-253']
division between people in white coats and people in blue blazers.:::['4-11-254']
i ask myself, "my god, why?":::['4-11-255']
now, i say we shed these coats......that separate us.:::['4-11-256']
and we get to know the people underneath.:::['4-11-257']
i'm ross!:::['4-11-258']
i'm divorced and i have a kid!:::['4-11-259']
i'm joey! i'm an actor!:::['4-11-260']
i don't know squat about dinosaurs!:::['4-11-261']
i'm ted, and i just moved here, and new york really scares me.:::['4-11-262']
there you go! hang in there, teddy!:::['4-11-263']
i'm andrew.:::['4-11-264']
and i didn't pay for this pear.:::['4-11-265']
okay. good for you.:::['4-11-266']
i'm rhonda! and these aren't real!:::['4-11-267']
wow, rhonda.:::['4-11-268']
i'm scott. yeah, okay, scott!:::['4-11-269']
i flip the light switch on and off 17 times when i leave a room......or my family will die.:::['4-11-270']
my mom will be here soon.:::['4-11-271']
i can't. i can't give him up.:::['4-11-272']
yes, no. i can.:::['4-11-273']
but i can.:::['4-11-275']
i can't watch this. it's like sophie's choice.:::['4-11-277']
you know, i never saw that.:::['4-11-278']
oh, it was only okay.:::['4-11-279']
i can't do this.:::['4-11-280', '3-19-213']
my mom was right. if i can't give him up......there's no way:::['4-11-281']
i can give up a baby.:::['4-11-282']
frank and alice are going to be so crushed.:::['4-11-283']
what else can i give them? a kidney!:::['4-11-284']
we were in the neighborhood.:::['4-11-285']
we want to let you know that there's still no pressure.:::['4-11-286']
alice: none.:::['4-11-287']
if there was something you wanted to say, we'll be right there.:::['4-11-288']
who's this little guy?:::['4-11-290']
phoebe: oh, um, well...:::['4-11-291']
he's so cute! he reminds me of my old dog, tumor.:::['4-11-292']
you are so precious, i'd take you home.:::['4-11-293']
why don't you?:::['4-11-294']
what are you doing? i'm okay with this.:::['4-11-298']
you know why? because look at them.:::['4-11-299']
look how happy they are.:::['4-11-300']
and i made that, so you know......it'll be a million times harder:::['4-11-301']
to give up a baby. but god!:::['4-11-302']
it'll feel a million times better, right?:::['4-11-303']
i'll do this. i want to carry your baby.:::['4-11-304']
thank you so much!:::['4-11-306']
you don't know what this means to us.:::['4-11-307']
i think i'm going to cry!:::['4-11-308']
it's going to be so great.:::['4-11-309']
what's going on? i gave them the puppy.:::['4-11-311']
it made them so happy, i decided to carry their baby.:::['4-11-312']
phoebe... no, i know.:::['4-11-313']
we're different, though.:::['4-11-314']
this is a different situation.:::['4-11-315']
i am not going to regret this.:::['4-11-316']
i understand all that.:::['4-11-317']
it's just, that was my puppy.:::['4-11-318']
would you ever be a surrogate?:::['4-11-320']
depends who asked.:::['4-11-321']
what if i asked?:::['4-11-322']
oh, mon, sure!:::['4-11-323']
you're not asking me, are you? no.:::['4-11-325']
yes. totally.:::['4-11-326']
thank you! thank you!:::['4-11-327']
yes, thank you!:::['4-11-329']
sorry i'm late. did i miss anything?:::['4-10-1']
joey stuffing fifteen oreos in his mouth.:::['4-10-2']
fifteen?:::['4-10-3']
your personal best! ha, ha.:::['4-10-4']
mm-mm. mm.:::['4-10-5']
where were you?:::['4-10-6']
on a date.:::['4-10-7']
i met this girl on a train going to a museum upstate.:::['4-10-8']
phoebe: which museum? chandler: how'd you meet her?:::['4-10-9']
no. answer his.:::['4-10-10']
we were at the back of the train.:::['4-10-11']
i sat near the door so she'd have to pass by me......if she wanted to switch cars.:::['4-10-12']
she was totally at my mercy.:::['4-10-13']
were you so late because you were burying this woman?:::['4-10-14']
i'm late because she lives in poughkeepsie.:::['4-10-15']
she seems great, but she's two and a half hours away.:::['4-10-16']
how can she be great if she's from poughkeepsie? ha-ha-ha.:::['4-10-17']
that joke would have killed in albany.:::['4-10-18']
done! i did it.:::['4-10-19']
who's stupid now?:::['4-10-20']
look! they're lighting the big christmas tree tonight.:::['4-10-21']
um, that paper is two weeks old.:::['4-10-22']
who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?:::['4-10-23']
i really wanted to take kathy to this.:::['4-10-24']
at least you have somebody to miss stuff with.:::['4-10-25']
i hate being alone this time of year.:::['4-10-26']
next it's valentine's day... ...then my birthday, then bang!:::['4-10-27']
then they're lighting that damn tree again.:::['4-10-28']
i want somebody!:::['4-10-29']
you know, i want a man!:::['4-10-30']
it doesn't even have to be a big relationship. just a fling!:::['4-10-31']
i didn't think girls ever just wanted a fling.:::['4-10-32']
let me tell you, it's been a long time since i've been flung.:::['4-10-33']
i know what i'm giving you for christmas.:::['4-10-34']
there are nice guys in my office. want me to set you up?:::['4-10-35']
i've been single a long time. why haven't you offered before?:::['4-10-37']
i have a girlfriend. i'm happy.:::['4-10-38']
i no longer go out of my way to stop others from being happy.:::['4-10-39']
no accountants.:::['4-10-41']
and no one from "legal." i don't like boring jobs.:::['4-10-42']
and ross was what? a lion tamer?:::['4-10-43']
phoebe: what's wrong, mon?:::['4-10-44']
everybody at work still hates me.:::['4-10-45']
i was making headway.:::['4-10-46']
everyone was smiling at me, and then i get off work......and find out they wrote this:::['4-10-47']
on my chef's hat.:::['4-10-48']
maybe they meant to write "quiet, bitch.":::['4-10-49']
fine! just trying to be nice.:::['4-10-51']
i haven't been picked on this much since kindergarten.:::['4-10-52']
and they brought in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me.:::['4-10-53']
they're trying to make me quit. if it were any other job, i would.:::['4-10-55']
but i've waited for this my whole life.:::['4-10-56']
wait, you're the boss. yell at them. or fire them!:::['4-10-57']
i would love to, but i can't. i'm not good at confrontation.:::['4-10-58']
you know what you can do?:::['4-10-59']
i read about this director, orson welles......who, at the beginning, would:::['4-10-60']
hire somebody just to fire them.:::['4-10-61']
then they would all know who was boss.:::['4-10-62']
i'm not doing anything. why not fire me?:::['4-10-63']
it's a good idea. can you waiter?:::['4-10-64']
good enough to get fired.:::['4-10-65']
all right. you're hired!:::['4-10-66']
that's why i got fired last week! does orson welles direct commercials?:::['4-10-68']
i say, drew? are you seeing anybody right now?:::['4-10-70']
i'm not asking for me.:::['4-10-71']
i'm not gay. i'm not asking you out.:::['4-10-72']
i'm not gay.:::['4-10-73']
i didn't think you were gay.:::['4-10-74']
i do now.:::['4-10-75']
my friend, rachel, wants to be set up.:::['4-10-76']
i just got out of a big relationship.:::['4-10-77']
i'm not looking to get serious.:::['4-10-78']
that's okay. a fling might be all right with her.:::['4-10-79']
whoa, whoa, whoa. is this "hot rachel" that you took to the christmas party?:::['4-10-80']
by the way, that is her full name.:::['4-10-81']
wow! i'm free for her.:::['4-10-82']
wait, i didn't say i wasn't free.:::['4-10-83']
let's talk it over at the ranger game.:::['4-10-84']
hold on. i just got a box of cubans.:::['4-10-85']
i'll bring them by your office at 5.:::['4-10-86']
that's a little later than i usually stay, but sure.:::['4-10-87']
before the game, we could enjoy some eight-year-old basil haydens.:::['4-10-88']
i don't know what that is, but let's!:::['4-10-89']
i'm writing a holiday song for everyone. do you want to hear it?:::['4-10-90']
joey: yeah! rachel: yes!:::['4-10-91']
happy hanukkah, monica:::['4-10-93']
may your christmas be snowy, joey:::['4-10-94']
happy new year, chandler and ross:::['4-10-95']
spin the dreidel, rachel:::['4-10-96']
pheebs, that's great! phoebe: oh, yay!:::['4-10-97']
but you know, uh, rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.:::['4-10-98']
i know, but it's so hard. nothing rhymes with your stupid name!:::['4-10-99']
what are you talking about? lots of things rhyme with rachel::::['4-10-100']
bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.:::['4-10-101']
maypole.:::['4-10-102']
all good. thanks.:::['4-10-103']
um, do you, maybe, have a nickname that's easier to rhyme?:::['4-10-104']
didn't your dad call you "pumpkin"? oh, yeah.:::['4-10-105']
but did he ever call you "budolph"?:::['4-10-106']
have i got the 50 guys for you!:::['4-10-108']
i showed them your picture.:::['4-10-110']
guys are throwing themselves at me and giving me stuff.:::['4-10-111']
knicks tonight? where are the seats?:::['4-10-112']
wherever! i've got 20.:::['4-10-113']
will i like any of these guys?:::['4-10-114']
you know, i'm going to, uh......play the field a little bit more.:::['4-10-115']
rachel: chandler...:::['4-10-116']
guys are signing over their 401 ks to me.:::['4-10-117']
you work with robots?:::['4-10-118']
one guy, patrick, you'll like him. he's nice, funny and a swimmer.:::['4-10-120']
i like swimmers' bodies.:::['4-10-121']
his dad made the magnetic strip on credit cards.:::['4-10-122']
i like credit cards!:::['4-10-123']
i'm not bad at this!:::['4-10-124']
what does he do? he works in fine foods.:::['4-10-125']
you have a fine foods division? it's a big company...:::['4-10-126']
now, wait a second. you make food and robots?:::['4-10-127']
no, the robots just work for them.:::['4-10-128']
monica: all right, i'm going to work.:::['4-10-129']
yeah, lady. i do! i got a problem!:::['4-10-131']
i'll give you a problem!:::['4-10-132']
what will you do? fire me?:::['4-10-133']
you bet your ass i'll fire you!:::['4-10-134']
i should go. i've got a date.:::['4-10-136']
with who?:::['4-10-137']
you know the girl who lives in poughkeepsie?:::['4-10-138']
this is someone else. i can't decide between the two.:::['4-10-140']
the one from poughkeepsie, though two hours away, is pretty......really smart and a lot of fun.:::['4-10-141']
but this other girl, she lives right uptown.:::['4-10-142']
she's just as pretty.:::['4-10-143']
i guess she's smart. she's not fun.:::['4-10-144']
if she's no fun, why date her at all?:::['4-10-145']
i want to give her a chance. she lives so close.:::['4-10-146']
and, at the end of the date, she said something that......if she was kidding,was very funny.:::['4-10-147']
if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun. she's stupid and racist.:::['4-10-148']
how was your first day at the restaurant?:::['4-10-150']
joey: hey. monica: hey.:::['4-10-152']
what happened to your fancy jacket?:::['4-10-153']
they baked it.:::['4-10-154']
i can't take this anymore.:::['4-10-155']
i'm going to fire you tonight. you got it. oh, oh!:::['4-10-156']
you're still on fire there.:::['4-10-158']
i think you got it!:::['4-10-159']
chandler, you have the best taste in men.:::['4-10-160']
like father, like son.:::['4-10-161']
patrick and i had such a great time last night!:::['4-10-162']
this could, maybe, get serious.:::['4-10-163']
i thought you weren't looking for serious. just a fling?:::['4-10-164']
well, you know, possibly.:::['4-10-165']
you didn't tell him that, though, right?:::['4-10-166']
uh, no?:::['4-10-167']
you told this guy that i was looking for a fling?:::['4-10-168']
you don't tell him that! why not?:::['4-10-169']
i'd be thrilled if some hot girl...:::['4-10-170']
you telling him i want a fling and me putting out......he's so going to get:::['4-10-172']
the wrong idea!:::['4-10-173']
joey, could you pass the cheese?:::['4-10-174']
i'd prefer you didn't call me joey.:::['4-10-175']
i thought it might be fun to try out a cool nickname.:::['4-10-176']
hey, dragon!:::['4-10-177']
here's your tips from monday and tuesday.:::['4-10-178']
there's $300 in this one.:::['4-10-179']
people get generous around the holidays.:::['4-10-180']
and it never hurts to wear tight trousers.:::['4-10-181']
could the waiters listen to the specials?:::['4-10-182']
there's chilean sea bass with a mango relish...:::['4-10-183']
why is nobody writing these?:::['4-10-184']
we can remember them.:::['4-10-185']
because you'll make up fake specials and make me cook them?:::['4-10-186']
sure, that too.:::['4-10-187']
forget the specials for a minute. um, here's the thing...:::['4-10-188']
for the last two weeks i have, uh......tried hard to create:::['4-10-189']
a positive atmosphere.:::['4-10-190']
can't hear you!:::['4-10-191']
positive atmosphere.:::['4-10-192']
but i've had it up to here.:::['4-10-193']
from now on, it is going to be my way......or the highway. all right?:::['4-10-194']
hey, new guy.:::['4-10-196']
i said, does anybody have a problem with that?:::['4-10-197']
no, ma'am.:::['4-10-198']
he has a name. it's dragon.:::['4-10-199']
you want to know your name? check your hat.:::['4-10-200']
we did the hat, right?:::['4-10-201']
what the hell just happened? i am so sorry.:::['4-10-202']
i was going to do it.:::['4-10-203']
but i was standing there with $327 in one hand......and $238 in the other.:::['4-10-204']
and i was thinking......it's been a long time since i had......327 plus $238!:::['4-10-205']
we had a deal! it's why you're here. i've got to fire you!:::['4-10-206']
and i got to pay rent!:::['4-10-207']
how about you don't fire me.:::['4-10-208']
instead, i stay. i gain their trust.:::['4-10-209']
they'll listen to the nice things i say about you.:::['4-10-210']
what nice things?:::['4-10-211']
nothing yet. they hate you, and i want to fit in.:::['4-10-212']
chandler and monica, merry, merry...:::['4-10-213']
i'm not jewish so...:::['4-10-215']
ross doesn't decorate his tree with floss......but he's not complaining.:::['4-10-216']
bad dream?:::['4-10-217']
i wasn't sleeping.:::['4-10-218']
what was phoebe's song about?:::['4-10-219']
it's the one with the cat.:::['4-10-220']
i got to go. i've got another date.:::['4-10-221']
phoebe: did you pick one yet?:::['4-10-222']
it turns out the one from uptown was making a joke.:::['4-10-223']
it was a different joke. it wasn't that funny.:::['4-10-224']
so i'm still torn.:::['4-10-225']
you don't like the one from uptown.:::['4-10-226']
and you're exhausted from dating poughkeepsie.:::['4-10-227']
just end them both!:::['4-10-228']
go to poughkeepsie and break up with her.:::['4-10-229']
then break up with uptown.:::['4-10-230']
by the time you get home, you're done!:::['4-10-231']
you're right. thank you.:::['4-10-232']
i had a similar problem when i lived in prague.:::['4-10-233']
prague? so much you don't know.:::['4-10-234']
rachel: chandler?:::['4-10-235']
patrick just, uh, ended things with me.:::['4-10-236']
did you or didn't you tell him i wanted a serious relationship?:::['4-10-237']
i did! i absolutely did!:::['4-10-238']
you idiot!:::['4-10-239', '4-20-176']
i'm sure you're right. but why?:::['4-10-240']
you don't tell a guy that you want a serious relationship.:::['4-10-241']
now you scared him away!:::['4-10-242']
i am sorry. i am so sorry.:::['4-10-243']
you should never be allowed to talk to people!:::['4-10-244']
now i'm right back where i started.:::['4-10-246']
being alone sucks!:::['4-10-248']
you'll meet somebody.:::['4-10-249']
you're a great catch!:::['4-10-250']
when i told those guys about you, i didn't have to lie once.:::['4-10-251']
you graduated magna cum laude, right?:::['4-10-253']
it doesn't matter.:::['4-10-255']
i got tickets to the ranger game. you want to come with me?:::['4-10-256']
cute guys in little shorts?:::['4-10-257']
actually, it's a hockey team. angry canadians with no teeth.:::['4-10-259']

treeger: what in the name of hell?:::['4-17-2']
maybe he found your flip-flop.:::['4-17-3']
chandler: hey. whoa.:::['4-17-4']
is this porn?:::['4-17-5']
what did i do? i must have hit something on the remote.:::['4-17-6']
do we pay for this?:::['4-17-7']
no, we didn't even pay our cable bill.:::['4-17-8']
maybe this is how they punish us.:::['4-17-9']
maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill. free phone sex.:::['4-17-10']
maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.:::['4-17-11']
whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.:::['4-17-12']
yeah, joey just pressed something on the remote and it just came on.:::['4-17-13']
it happened to me once. i was flipping through the channels and, bam.:::['4-17-14']
it was like finding money. finding money with naked people on it.:::['4-17-15']
then i made the mistake of turning off the tv. i never got it back again.:::['4-17-16']
and i'm sad.:::['4-17-17']
why would he turn off the tv?:::['4-17-18']
all right, you know what? do we really have to watch this while we eat?:::['4-17-19']
chandler & joey: no, no, no.:::['4-17-20']
we don't know what could make this go away.:::['4-17-21']
yeah, so no one touches the remote, and no one touches the tv.:::['4-17-22']
and no one touches the air around the tv.:::['4-17-23']
imagine a protective porn bubble, if you will.:::['4-17-24']
i'm at least going to mute it. both: no, no, no.:::['4-17-25']
we still have porn. yeah.:::['4-17-26']
honey, what are you doing? that's too heavy. give it here. phoebe: yeah.:::['4-17-28']
i'm getting too pregnant for this... lugging around a stupid massage table.:::['4-17-32']
i have to find a job where i carry a smaller table. or a job where you don't have to carry a table.:::['4-17-33']
you mean, like a doctor?:::['4-17-34']
pheebs, you're blocking the porn. look out.:::['4-17-35']
oh, that reminds me. i have to see my ob-gyn today.:::['4-17-38']
so, uh, emily just went to the airport.:::['4-17-40']
aw. why didn't you take her?:::['4-17-41']
ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it. and you know, we said our goodbyes this morning, so...:::['4-17-42']
you must feel horrible. hey, the guys have free porn.:::['4-17-43']
hey, cheer up. you're gonna see her again, right?:::['4-17-45']
well, that's the thing. i don't know. i mean, whenever i brought it up with her, she said::::['4-17-46']
why do we have to talk about the future?:::['4-17-47']
let's enjoy..." don't do the accent.:::['4-17-48']
you've got to see her again.:::['4-17-49']
why do you care? because. you could get to live out my fantasy.:::['4-17-50']
you've had fantasies about emily?:::['4-17-51']
no. you know, the fantasy.:::['4-17-52']
meet someone from a strange land... ...fall madly in love and spend the rest of your lives together.:::['4-17-53']
is that why, in junior high... ...you were the only one who hung out with that ukrainian kid?:::['4-17-54']
yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.:::['4-17-55']
do you love her?:::['4-17-56']
we said it was only gonna be two weeks, you know?:::['4-17-57']
you love her.:::['4-17-58', '4-5-95']
what is love, really?:::['4-17-59']
i knew you loved her.:::['4-17-60']
you need to go to the airport and tell her.:::['4-17-61']
you're probably gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate.:::['4-17-62']
you're gonna call out her name and yell, "i love you.":::['4-17-63']
she's gonna say, "i love you too.":::['4-17-64']
then you guys are gonna have the most amazing kiss. everyone at the gate will applaud.:::['4-17-65']
i am a good kisser.:::['4-17-66']
then you two can sneak into the cockpit.:::['4-17-67']
things will start to heat up.:::['4-17-68']
and then a stewardess comes in...:::['4-17-69']
i've been watching too much porn.:::['4-17-70']
over sonogram]:::['4-17-71']
is that the heartbeat? that's it.:::['4-17-72']
oh, wow. this is so cool.:::['4-17-74']
have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?:::['4-17-75']
why don't we just take care of this one? and should i get pregnant again, i'll hold onto your card, okay?:::['4-17-76']
no, i'm getting three separate heartbeats.:::['4-17-77']
three? you guys were worried i wouldn't even have one.:::['4-17-78']
doctors are wrong all the time. well...:::['4-17-79']
well, so are you sure that there are three?:::['4-17-80']
doctor: definitely. phoebe: oh, my god.:::['4-17-81']
oh, my god. oh, my god. doctor: ha, ha.:::['4-17-82']
so in a few months... ...i'm gonna have three full-grown babies just walking around inside me?:::['4-17-83']
oh, oh. and it's gonna be like one of those log rides... ...when they just come shooting out.:::['4-17-84']
giving birth to three babies is not that different than giving birth to one.:::['4-17-85']
what do you know?:::['4-17-86']
phoebe. phoebe: oh! hi.:::['4-17-87']
so how'd it go at the doctor's?:::['4-17-88']
oh, well, okay. hey.:::['4-17-89']
you know how, when you're, um, walking down the street... ...and you see three people in a row.:::['4-17-90']
and you say "oh, that's nice.":::['4-17-91']
yes. phoebe: okay.:::['4-17-92']
yeah, well, good news. you're gonna have three babies. aah!:::['4-17-93']
three babies? phoebe: uh-huh.:::['4-17-94']
i've finally got my band.:::['4-17-96']
we're gonna have a big family! i always wanted a big family!:::['4-17-97']
oh, god. i'm so glad you guys are happy. i was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.:::['4-17-98']
oh. why would we be freaked?:::['4-17-99']
no, because maybe it's harder to raise them and the added expense. ugh!:::['4-17-100']
no, back to happy. back to happy!:::['4-17-102']
no, no, no. it's gonna be fine... ...because, um... because i teach home ec.:::['4-17-103']
and i can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long.:::['4-17-104']
you know, it'll be like my very own little sweatshop.:::['4-17-105']
you know, i've been thinking... ...ever since you said that we're gonna have triplets.:::['4-17-106']
the best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job.:::['4-17-107']
alice: frank. no, you can't quit college. no.:::['4-17-108']
you're in college? really?:::['4-17-109']
yeah, refrigerator college. yeah.:::['4-17-110']
yeah, you know, when we found out we were gonna have a baby......i figured, you know,i should have, like, a career, you know?:::['4-17-111']
and i love refrigerators. yeah.:::['4-17-112']
you can't give up on your dream. ugh.:::['4-17-113']
no, it's okay. we're gonna have three kids.:::['4-17-114']
and that's a different kind of dream.:::['4-17-115']
three kids and no money.:::['4-17-116']
this is the boarding call for flight 009.:::['4-17-117']
ross: emily.:::['4-17-118']
oh, my god. what are you doing here?:::['4-17-119']
i just... i had to see you one more time before you took off.:::['4-17-120']
that's a big candy bar.:::['4-17-122']
i had the most amazing time with you. me too.:::['4-17-123']
woman: this is the final boarding call for flight 009.:::['4-17-124']
well, that's me.:::['4-17-125']
here, have this. i'm only allowed one piece of carry-on anyway.:::['4-17-126']
wait, uh...:::['4-17-127']
listen, i have to tell you something.:::['4-17-128']
i've been thinking. i'm just going to come out and say it, okay? uh...:::['4-17-129']
i think... ...i love you.:::['4-17-130']
it's no problem.:::['4-17-133']
what is that song that has been in my head all day? it's the theme from good will humping.:::['4-17-134']
you know who doesn't even like dirty movies? my new boyfriend joshua. yeah, right.:::['4-17-135']
no, he told me he prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.:::['4-17-136']
oh, oh, yeah. did he also say that he thought some of the dialogue was corny?:::['4-17-137']
and that he actually found it funny, not sexy? yes.:::['4-17-138']
yeah, he likes porn.:::['4-17-139']
i'm gonna find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny.:::['4-17-141']
hey, pheebs. hi.:::['4-17-142']
both: hi. hey. how'd it go with frank and alice?:::['4-17-143']
frank has to quit college... ...because his super-fertile sister is having three babies. ugh.:::['4-17-144']
i need to make a lot of money really fast.:::['4-17-145']
and i had an idea that i wanted to talk to you about... ...because you work for a big company. okay.:::['4-17-146']
insider trading.:::['4-17-147']
what information is there that you can give me?:::['4-17-148']
well, actually, they don't really talk to us about that stuff. i can get you some free white-out, though.:::['4-17-149']
huh! did you do what i said? did you tell her?:::['4-17-150']
i did. and what did she say? "thank you.":::['4-17-151']
you're totally welcome. what'd she say?:::['4-17-152']
she said, "thank you.":::['4-17-153']
i said, "i love you." and she said, "thank you.":::['4-17-154']
oh, wait. did you say you love her?:::['4-17-155']
yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?:::['4-17-156']
what do i do now? you play hard-to-get.:::['4-17-157']
she already lives in london.:::['4-17-158']
so you go to tokyo.:::['4-17-159']
all right, look, forget it. okay, forget it. you told her you love her. it's over.:::['4-17-160']
it is not over. you're over.:::['4-17-161']
okay. good one.:::['4-17-164']
it's not over because she's gonna call you and tell you she loves you.:::['4-17-165']
the reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her.:::['4-17-166']
now, you go home and you wait for her call. she could be calling you from the plane. come on, go.:::['4-17-167']
okay, okay. but if she doesn't call, it is definitely over.:::['4-17-168']
no, wait, wait. unless, eventually, i call her, you know, to see what's going on......and she says she'll call me back,but then she doesn't.:::['4-17-169']
then it's over.:::['4-17-170']
way to be strong, man.:::['4-17-171']
listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? we need a porn break.:::['4-17-173']
we spent the last two hours watching in and out and in again.:::['4-17-174']
well, so why don't you just turn it off? because then we'd be the guys who turned off free porn.:::['4-17-175']
oh, good, you're here.:::['4-17-176']
rachel: what you got there? oh, this? well, i'm glad you asked.:::['4-17-178']
now, don't you hate it when you have to cut a tin can... ...with an ordinary steak knife?:::['4-17-179']
now, i know what you're thinking. pregnant woman slays four?:::['4-17-181']
they didn't make you pay for those knives, did they?:::['4-17-182']
no. are you sure? no.:::['4-17-183']
you're not gonna make enough money to help frank and alice by selling knives.:::['4-17-184']
no, no. i know that. but i just need to make enough money for the second part of my plan.:::['4-17-185']
what's the second part of your plan? my saturn dealership.:::['4-17-186']
emily. hi.:::['4-17-189']
uh, how was your flight? it was dreadful.:::['4-17-190']
uh, i felt terrible about how i acted when you said those wonderful things.:::['4-17-191']
no, no, that's all right. um... i'm just glad you called.:::['4-17-192']
ross, um, there's something that i've got to tell you.:::['4-17-193']
there's someone else.:::['4-17-194']
does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america?:::['4-17-195']
she doesn't know which one of us she wants. me or this "colin" guy.:::['4-17-196']
this isn't how it was supposed to go. i mean, there can't be another guy.:::['4-17-197']
of course there's another guy. heh. this is even more perfect.:::['4-17-199']
now you have to prove your love.:::['4-17-200']
i'm not proving anything, okay? i'm done listening to you.:::['4-17-201']
if i hadn't let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place... ...i wouldn't have put my fist through the wall.:::['4-17-202']
you put your fist through the wall? no, i missed and hit the door.:::['4-17-203']
but it opened really hard.:::['4-17-204']
you have to go to london. what?:::['4-17-205']
yep. you have to go fight for her. oh, yeah, sure. that makes sense.:::['4-17-206']
because you already told her you loved her, and she didn't say it back. then she called you and told you there was another guy.:::['4-17-207']
so yeah. go to london. that will scare her.:::['4-17-208']
when rachel was with paolo, what did you do?:::['4-17-209']
i made fun of his accent.:::['4-17-210']
you sat back and let him have her. you didn't fight at all. am i right?:::['4-17-211']
you want the same thing to happen with emily? no. monica: all right, then.:::['4-17-212']
go fight for her. go to london.:::['4-17-213']
i mean, that could be you and emily.:::['4-17-214']
that, but nicer.:::['4-17-215']
just go to london. really? come on.:::['4-17-216']
surprise her. show up at her doorstep. don't let her go without a fight.:::['4-17-217']
all right. all right. i'm going to do it. monica: all right. i'm gonna go to london, and i am gonna fight for her.:::['4-17-218']
ross, ross. if you're going to the airport... ...can you pick me up another one of those toblerone bars?:::['4-17-220']
oh, oh, i did it. i did it. i figured out a way to make money.:::['4-17-221']
i'm gonna open up my own massage place and frank's gonna help me.:::['4-17-222']
and we can work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.:::['4-17-223']
la-la-la.:::['4-17-224']
that sounds great. but how can you afford it?:::['4-17-225']
we were walking down the street... ...and we saw that van you used for catering.:::['4-17-226']
and we realized... i'm telling it. i'm telling it.:::['4-17-227']
okay, you know how people need transportation... ...but they also need massages to relax?:::['4-17-228']
so i just figured we could combine the two. okay, i give the massages and frank drives.:::['4-17-229']
i can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back and you know what i've got?:::['4-17-230']
a place that no one will ever get out of alive?:::['4-17-231']
no, think about it. it's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.:::['4-17-232']
it's a relaxi-taxi.:::['4-17-233']
the name was my favorite part.:::['4-17-234']
well, i came up with it. you did not!:::['4-17-235']
no. you came up with relaxi-cab. that's not good.:::['4-17-237']
oh, my god. ross, are you in england? was emily surprised?:::['4-17-239']
ross: no, because she hasn't come home yet.:::['4-17-240']
and she hasn't been home all night. she's obviously staying with that other guy.:::['4-17-241']
and i'm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment.:::['4-17-242']
all right, when is the next flight out? about four hours.:::['4-17-243']
okay, just stay there a couple more hours. if she doesn't show up, come home.:::['4-17-244']
hey, tell him about relaxi-taxi.:::['4-17-245']
and ask him if he thinks that is better than relaxi-cab.:::['4-17-246']
it's not relaxi-cab. it's relaxi-cab. like taxi-cab.:::['4-17-247']
ooh, that is better.:::['4-17-248']
are we in london?:::['4-17-249']
why are you doing here? you can't be here.:::['4-17-250']
i've come to talk to ross.:::['4-17-251']
nothing. no, nothing.:::['4-17-253']
i was gonna call him... oh, you came to tell him you love him. i knew it!:::['4-17-254']
i was right! i'm right, right?:::['4-17-255']
i'd really rather talk to him.:::['4-17-256']
i've been to his apartment and he's not there. and i need to talk to him.:::['4-17-257']
so do you have any idea where he is?:::['4-17-258']
ross, are you there?:::['4-17-259']
ross, i don't know if you can hear this, but i'm gonna talk anyway.:::['4-17-260']
i'm in the states with your sister and your friends.:::['4-17-261']
and it's all over with colin.:::['4-17-262']
i came here to tell you that and to tell you...:::['4-17-263']
yes, joey, you can have all the chocolate you want. just take it.:::['4-17-264']
i came here to tell you that i love you.:::['4-17-265']
i love you too. i'm gonna call you right now from the phone booth.:::['4-17-266']
you can't hear me.:::['4-17-267']
i wish i could know if you'd heard any of that.:::['4-17-268']
i suppose i've either told you that i love you or given my neighbors a good laugh.:::['4-17-269']
mrs. newman, if you're listening, bugger off. this is none of your business.:::['4-17-270']
suppose there's not much chance you did hear that. and there's the call waiting......so i should go.:::['4-17-271']
ross, i love you.:::['4-17-275']
i was just at the bank and there was this really hot teller.:::['4-17-279']
and she didn't ask me to go do it with her in the vault.:::['4-17-280']
same kind of thing happened to me.:::['4-17-281']
woman pizza delivery guy comes over... ...gives me the pizza, takes the money and leaves.:::['4-17-282']
what, no "nice apartment, bet the bedrooms are huge"?:::['4-17-283']
you know what? we have to turn off the porn. i think you're right.:::['4-17-285']
all right, ready? one. two. three. three.:::['4-17-286']
yeah, that's kind of a relief. yeah.:::['4-17-288']
you want to see if we still have it? yeah.:::['4-17-289']
free porn! we have free porn!:::['4-17-290']
monica: what is it?:::['4-16-0', '3-21-269']
nothing. i can't find anything that i want to eat. everything makes me nauseous.:::['4-16-1']
i'm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cake. oh, cake.:::['4-16-2']
aw, honey, i'm sorry. god.:::['4-16-4']
ooh, what is that smell? it's coming from the bathroom.:::['4-16-5']
wow, pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.:::['4-16-6']
joey: yeah. it's me. it's phoebe. listen, there's something in here i want to eat. what?:::['4-16-7']
what smells so good?:::['4-16-8']
is it the shampoo? it's guava.:::['4-16-9']
ugh. oh, wait, wait.:::['4-16-11']
is it my bologna sandwich?:::['4-16-12']
i can't believe it. the baby wants bologna. the baby wants me to eat meat.:::['4-16-14']
i can't eat meat. uh, wait, wait.:::['4-16-15']
maybe it's the pickle.:::['4-16-16']
what are you writing?:::['4-16-17']
well, joshua's coming in tomorrow... ...and since i don't have the guts to ask him out......i'm gonna sell him a coat:::['4-16-18']
and put this note in the pocket.:::['4-16-19']
chandler: oh, yeah? oh.:::['4-16-20']
"joshua, give me a call sometime. guys like you......never go out of style.":::['4-16-21']
what did you throw away?:::['4-16-22']
hi, guys. hey, what have you guys been up to?:::['4-16-23']
oh, we went to see a collection of victorian doorknobs at the cooper-hewitt museum.:::['4-16-24']
without me?:::['4-16-25']
my uncle dragged us there, but actually it turned out to be interesting.:::['4-16-26']
yeah. they were so ornate and beautiful. i mean, look at that.:::['4-16-27']
i don't know how museums work in england... ...but here, you're not supposed to take stuff.:::['4-16-28']
i, uh... i got it from the gift shop.:::['4-16-29']
they have really lax security there.:::['4-16-30']
it's a joke.:::['4-16-31']
ross: bye.:::['4-16-32']
right, i've got to be off. i'll see you. bye-bye, then.:::['4-16-33']
group: bye.:::['4-16-34']
wow. hey, you guys seem to be having a good time.:::['4-16-35']
oh, yeah, she is amazing, and she's so much fun.:::['4-16-36']
and you know what? when i'm with her, i'm fun.:::['4-16-37']
i even signed up for helicopter classes.:::['4-16-38']
she's leaving in two days. i don't have to do it.:::['4-16-39']
aw, two days? you must be bummed. ross: yeah.:::['4-16-40']
she's got to go back to london.:::['4-16-41']
but you know what? i've been prepared for this from the start. we both knew we had two weeks together and then that's it, you know?:::['4-16-42']
hey, that's what all my relationships are like.:::['4-16-43']
yes, but in ross' case, they both know in two weeks that's it.:::['4-16-44']
group: pheebs, hey.:::['4-16-45']
hello, hello. yeah, i know. yeah.:::['4-16-46']
so the baby is totally craving meat.:::['4-16-47']
this afternoon, i tried tricking it.:::['4-16-48']
i made it a soy burger so that maybe it'd think it was getting meat.:::['4-16-49']
you know? and i got nauseous.:::['4-16-50']
well, maybe that's because soy burgers suck.:::['4-16-51']
being pregnant is hard on your tummy.:::['4-16-52']
hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant-lady glow.:::['4-16-53']
oh, that's sweat. you throw up all morning, you'll have that glow too.:::['4-16-54']
okay. uh, here's that trench coat you wanted. oh, great. great.:::['4-16-55']
wow, yeah, it's comfortable. yeah.:::['4-16-56']
man, you could really flash somebody in this thing.:::['4-16-57']
ha, ha. they don't want you to put your hands in the pockets... ...until you are out of the store.:::['4-16-58']
well, because... ...we get a lot of...:::['4-16-60']
you know, they ruin it for everybody. i know.:::['4-16-61']
you know, i wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.:::['4-16-62']
oh. it was the first date since the divorce.:::['4-16-63']
well, congratulations. so do you love her?:::['4-16-64']
no, no, no. she's nice, but, you know, it made me realize... ...i'm just not ready to be dating, you know?:::['4-16-65']
that's, uh... that's interesting.:::['4-16-68']
hey, whoa, hey.:::['4-16-69']
what was that? oh, that's just an antitheft device.:::['4-16-70']
then what's this?:::['4-16-71']
well, you need that too, because obviously a thief could just tear this up.:::['4-16-72']
listen, we have to have a party tonight. we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.:::['4-16-73']
what? yeah, what's going on?:::['4-16-74']
we have to have a surprise bon-voyage party for emily.:::['4-16-75']
but it's actually for joshua.:::['4-16-76']
look, he said he's not ready to date.:::['4-16-77']
so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside work.:::['4-16-78']
and now i have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.:::['4-16-79']
well, as much as i'd like to meet josh and warn him......emily and i aren't gonna be here,all right?:::['4-16-80']
she's gonna come by first to say goodbye.:::['4-16-81']
and then i've got a whole special evening planned. so sorry. no party.:::['4-16-82']
hello? surprise!:::['4-16-84']
both: surprise!:::['4-16-85']
no one's ever thrown me a surprise party before.:::['4-16-86']
well, it was all ross' idea.:::['4-16-87']
and i'm so surprised.:::['4-16-89']
you really didn't know?:::['4-16-90']
there's dancin':::['4-16-92']
behind movie scenes:::['4-16-93']
why are you over here if joshua's all the way over there?:::['4-16-94']
uh, because i'm trying to play hard-to-get.:::['4-16-95']
oh, quick. he's looking over here. say something funny.:::['4-16-96']
like what? ha-ha-ha.:::['4-16-97']
i said, "like what?":::['4-16-99']
now that's a thinker.:::['4-16-100']
okay, you know what? this playing-hard-to-get thing is not working.:::['4-16-101']
uh, hand me those cherries. okay.:::['4-16-102']
care for a cherry? no, thanks.:::['4-16-105']
you know, i can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.:::['4-16-106']
you okay? you all right?:::['4-16-107']
so we should probably get going soon.:::['4-16-108']
oh, but the party's only just getting started.:::['4-16-109']
yeah, but we have to be at the four seasons for drinks in, oh, 15 minutes.:::['4-16-110']
and then, uh, you know, then the plaza for dinner.:::['4-16-111']
so why did you plan a party at the same time?:::['4-16-112']
no, no, no. ha, ha.:::['4-16-113']
actually, american surprise parties are very short.:::['4-16-114']
it's usually, "surprise!" then, "oh, my god, i'm so surprised. goodbye.":::['4-16-115']
ross, i'm having such a great time.:::['4-16-116']
your sister has just been telling me that you used to dressed up like old ladies... ...and host make-believe tea parties.:::['4-16-117']
monica said that, did she?:::['4-16-118']
oh, yeah. then what are you going to put on top of that?:::['4-16-119']
a little salami. ooh, yeah. yeah.:::['4-16-120']
then, um, what goes on top of the salami?:::['4-16-121']
pastrami. oh, yeah.:::['4-16-122']
you're a genius.:::['4-16-123', '4-4-170', '3-17-352']
can someone give me a hand with the zipper.:::['4-16-124']
up.:::['4-16-125']
you changed? yeah, i just needed my lucky dress.:::['4-16-126']
and "lucky" means "more cleavage"? does for me.:::['4-16-127']
oh, god, look at him. he's so cute. i just want to go over there and grab him and kiss him.:::['4-16-128']
how could i kiss him without letting him know that i like him?:::['4-16-129']
hey, i know how you can get him. take off your bra.:::['4-16-130']
what? there was a scene in footloose... flashdance.:::['4-16-131']
yeah, yeah. yeah, with that plumber girl? she was a welder.:::['4-16-132']
were you, like, in the movie?:::['4-16-133']
anyway, she takes off her bra under the shirt... ...and pulls it out the sleeve.:::['4-16-134']
very sexy. and classy.:::['4-16-135']
or if you wanna kiss him, um, you could use mistletoe. it's not christmas.:::['4-16-136']
or spin the bottle. and he's not 11.:::['4-16-137']
thank you so much for this. it was really so thoughtful of you.:::['4-16-138']
you're leaving?:::['4-16-139']
yes, we have something we have to get to. uh, yeah, i think i'm gonna take off too.:::['4-16-140']
no, you guys, you can't leave yet. you have to stay. we've got the whole big thing planned.:::['4-16-141']
what big thing?:::['4-16-142']
rachel: so, spin-the-bottle works like this. i spin the bottle.:::['4-16-143']
lands on gunther, so i would have to kiss gunther.:::['4-16-144']
who wants to go first? i'll go.:::['4-16-146']
welcome to america.:::['4-16-147']
oh, my gosh. two in a row. you gotta use your tongues now.:::['4-16-151']
what are the odds? what are the odds?:::['4-16-153']
okay, that's enough, you know. ha, ha.:::['4-16-154']
let's let someone else play.:::['4-16-155']
hey, if you didn't want to play, then why'd you come to the party?:::['4-16-156']
okay, my turn.:::['4-16-157']
oh! look at that. oh, my god.:::['4-16-158']
oh, my god. the baby just kicked.:::['4-16-159']
it's okay, it's okay. if it kicked once, it'll kick again.:::['4-16-160']
all right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.:::['4-16-161']
it was a bug.:::['4-16-162']
it doesn't matter how much i'm craving it. you know why i'm never gonna eat meat? because it's cold-blooded murder.:::['4-16-163']
there's a phoebe on my sandwich.:::['4-16-165']
phoebe, what are you doing? i can't help it.:::['4-16-166']
i need the meat. the baby needs the meat.:::['4-16-167']
you know how when you're dating someone... ...and you don't want to cheat on them unless it's with someone really hot?:::['4-16-168']
yeah, totally. all right, okay.:::['4-16-169']
well, this is the same kind of deal. if you're gonna do something wrong......do it right.:::['4-16-170']
feel better? yeah, but at what cost?:::['4-16-171']
six more months, three meals a day?:::['4-16-172']
i'm gonna eat like, you know, millions of cows.:::['4-16-173']
hey, what if i said i could even things out for you, meat-wise?:::['4-16-174']
what? well, i eat a lot of meat, right?:::['4-16-175']
yeah. but suppose, until the baby's born... ...i laid off it.:::['4-16-176']
no extra animals would die. you'd just be eating my animals.:::['4-16-177']
joey, i can't believe you'd do that for me.:::['4-16-178']
absolutely. i could be a vegetarian.:::['4-16-179']
there's no meat in beer, right?:::['4-16-180']
okay, we can still make dinner if we skip the appetizers... ...and ask for our check right away.:::['4-16-181']
we can't go now. looks like rachel is going to put on a skit.:::['4-16-182']
oh, my god. have you lost your mind?:::['4-16-183']
no, no, no. i am finally thinking clearly.:::['4-16-184']
my lucky dress wasn't working out too well for me.:::['4-16-185']
but for four years, this baby never missed.:::['4-16-186']
rachel, wait, i can't let...:::['4-16-187']
actually, i kind of want to see what happens.:::['4-16-188']
nice, uh, costume.:::['4-16-190']
oh, yeah. well, i wanted to give emily a big american goodbye cheer.:::['4-16-191']
so okay. whoo!:::['4-16-192']
ready. okay.:::['4-16-193']
give me an "e." group: e.:::['4-16-194']
give me an "m." group: m.:::['4-16-195']
i give me an "i." group: i.:::['4-16-196']
l give me an "l." group: l.:::['4-16-197']
y give me a "y." group: y.:::['4-16-198']
what do you get?:::['4-16-199']
oh! emily. whoo! emily.:::['4-16-200']
okay. that's me as a cheerleader. ta-da!:::['4-16-201']
you all right? i just loosened a tooth.:::['4-16-202']
it's no big deal. i have a dentist, you know?:::['4-16-203']
i'm gonna go put some ice on it. excuse me.:::['4-16-204']
what do i do now? what do i do now? i think you're done.:::['4-16-205']
okay, time to take off the bra.:::['4-16-206']
uh, that was really great. but i got to take off, actually.:::['4-16-207']
take the bra off.:::['4-16-208']
all right, come on, let's go get your coat.:::['4-16-209']
rachel's my girlfriend.:::['4-16-211']
so this was really fun.:::['4-16-212']
oh, yeah, it was real fun.:::['4-16-213']
you know, this bra......is really bothering me.:::['4-16-214']
you know, this used to be my bedroom.:::['4-16-215']
yeah. a lot of memories in here. lot of memories.:::['4-16-216']
if these walls could talk, you know what they'd say? "want to hear some memories?":::['4-16-217']
need a...? need a little hand there? oh, no, no, no. no, i got this all under control.:::['4-16-218']
you really don't seem like you do.:::['4-16-219']
god. forget it! oh, this is...:::['4-16-220']
this is not how this was supposed to happen. what was supposed to happen?:::['4-16-221']
can you not look at me when i say this?:::['4-16-222']
i thought that if i could get you here......i could seduce you.:::['4-16-223']
uh, i don't wear suits to work... ...and i bought six of them from you.:::['4-16-224']
well, i'm sorry. i thought you needed them.:::['4-16-225']
my point is, i kept coming back because i wanted to see you.:::['4-16-226']
why? because i like you.:::['4-16-227']
you like me?:::['4-16-228']
yeah. i mean, you're beautiful and smart and sophisticated.:::['4-16-229']
a lot of this isn't, you know, based on tonight.:::['4-16-230']
but you like me?:::['4-16-231']
oh, my god. i can't believe this. all this time, i liked you and you liked me.:::['4-16-232']
but... no don't say "but.":::['4-16-234']
"but" is never good. let's leave it at "i like you and you like me.":::['4-16-235']
okay, uh... however... no, that's a fancy "but.":::['4-16-236']
my marriage, like, just ended.:::['4-16-237']
and i'm really not ready to get into anything yet.:::['4-16-238']
i'm sorry. i just need a little time.:::['4-16-240']
oh, there you are. i was looking for you before.:::['4-16-242']
joshua's gone, so you and emily are free to go.:::['4-16-243']
it's okay. she's still in there enjoying her fake party.:::['4-16-244']
and, uh, it's too late to do any of the stuff i had planned, so...:::['4-16-245']
ross. i'm sorry. i completely ruined your evening.:::['4-16-246']
ahem. yeah.:::['4-16-247']
well, if it makes you feel any better, i made a fool of myself.:::['4-16-248']
helps a little.:::['4-16-249']
is there a room on that step for a pathetic loser? yeah, have a seat.:::['4-16-250']
it's okay. i mean, it was just a two-week thing anyway.:::['4-16-252']
i just didn't want it to end this way, you know. or maybe you didn't want it to end?:::['4-16-253']
you seem to really like her.:::['4-16-255', '4-21-145']
yeah, i really do.:::['4-16-256', '3-19-104']
yeah, but what am i gonna do? we both agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.:::['4-16-257']
you know? no commitment.:::['4-16-258', '4-21-147']
that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends......asking to hear stories about you......looking through:::['4-16-260']
monica's photo albums.:::['4-16-261']
i mean, you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.:::['4-16-262', '4-21-149']
you've got, like, 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.:::['4-16-264']
and you're sitting here in a hallway......with a 28-year-old cheerleader:::['4-16-265']
with a fat lip.:::['4-16-266']
hey, you're right. yeah.:::['4-16-267']
what photo album was it? i don't know. it was you and a bunch of albino kids.:::['4-16-269']
oh, my god. those weren't albino kids. that was computer camp. rach.:::['4-16-270']
you're a pathetic loser, right? oh, yeah.:::['4-16-272']
joshua: hi.:::['4-16-274']
oh, my god. joshua.:::['4-16-275']
look. all those things i said about not being ready...:::['4-16-276']
they're not true? no, they're all true.:::['4-16-277']
oh, i love that "but.":::['4-16-281']
um, do you want to go inside and get some coffee? yeah. okay.:::['4-16-282']
every time.:::['4-16-283']
ooh, what do you got there? pastrami.:::['4-16-284']
hey, you know what goes good with that? mm-hm. corned beef.:::['4-16-286']
ooh, i was going to say bologna. but that's better.:::['4-16-287']
how about a little of that smoked turkey? okay.:::['4-16-288']
oh, mama.:::['4-16-289']
when is the baby due? six months.:::['4-16-290']
hey, now, if a cow should die of natural causes... ...i could have one of those, right?:::['4-16-291']
not if i get there first.:::['4-16-292']
i can't believe you won't be there. i know.:::['4-24-1']
why can't you take a couple of days off?:::['4-24-2']
because i can't. this is my wedding.:::['4-24-3']
i can't wait to see it. her parents got married there.:::['4-24-4']
it's the most beautiful place. it's right over...:::['4-24-5']
the only thing i understand is postponing is not an option.:::['4-24-7']
this wedding is not gonna happen.:::['4-24-8']
if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place or time. it's fine.:::['4-24-9']
it's perfect.:::['4-24-10', '4-23-314']
i'm going to london. what?:::['4-24-11']
it's not over until someone says, "i do.":::['4-24-12']
rachel, no!:::['4-24-14']
the waltham residence.:::['4-24-15']
hi, is this emily's parents' house? this is the housekeeper.:::['4-24-16']
and, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.:::['4-24-17']
first one identifies oneself......and then asks for the person:::['4-24-18']
with whom one wishes to speak.:::['4-24-19']
um, this is phoebe buffay.:::['4-24-20']
i was wondering, please......if it's not too much trouble, please......um, might i speak with:::['4-24-21']
miss emily waltham, please?:::['4-24-22']
miss waltham is at the rehearsal dinner.:::['4-24-23']
and it is not polite to make fun of people. goodbye.:::['4-24-24']
no, no! i'll be nice, i swear.:::['4-24-25']
could you just give me their number?:::['4-24-26']
i'm afraid i'm not at liberty to divulge that information.:::['4-24-27']
somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding, and i have to warn them.:::['4-24-28']
so give me that number or i'll come over there......and i'll kick your snooty ass:::['4-24-29']
all the way to new gloukenshire!:::['4-24-30']
hello? hello? oh!:::['4-24-31']
ooh, she knew i could kick her ass.:::['4-24-32']
judy: hi, sweetheart.:::['4-24-33']
ross: mom, dad.:::['4-24-34']
oh, sorry, we're late.:::['4-24-35']

oh, the hell with tradition! we're happy to do it.:::['4-24-53']
oh, we know how expensive weddings can be.:::['4-24-54']
besides, this may be the only wedding we get to throw.:::['4-24-55']
ahem, ha, ha.:::['4-24-56']
a joke that's funny in all countries.:::['4-24-57']
sir?:::['4-24-58']
what's in it? goat cheese, watercress and pancetta.:::['4-24-59']
that's not food.:::['4-24-60']

everything's different here. i want to go home.:::['4-24-62']
i miss my family, the coffeehouse.:::['4-24-63']
i can't remember what phoebe looks like!:::['4-24-64']
joey, it's been three days.:::['4-24-65']
okay, you're just a little homesick.:::['4-24-67']
would you just try to relax and just enjoy yourself?:::['4-24-68']
you're different here too.:::['4-24-69']
you're mean in england!:::['4-24-70']
jack: what the hell?:::['4-24-71']
what's up, dad?:::['4-24-72']
this bill for my half. it's insane.:::['4-24-73']
why is it so much? the reception's at their house.:::['4-24-74']
flowers, liquor. re-carpet first floor?:::['4-24-75']
new guest bath, landscaping.:::['4-24-76']
i'm paying to remodel this house.:::['4-24-77']
i'll give that son of a bitch a piece of my mind.:::['4-24-78']
dad. please.:::['4-24-79']
i don't want anything to upset emily.:::['4-24-80']
she's had a hard enough couple of days as it is.:::['4-24-81']
here. let me go talk to him.:::['4-24-82']
you tell him no one takes advantage of the gellers.:::['4-24-83']
ooh, jack.:::['4-24-84']
sometimes i forget how powerful you can be.:::['4-24-85']
and i'll go get drunk.:::['4-24-86']
hello. um, when is your next flight to london?:::['4-24-89']

i was hoping to get to know you better.:::['4-24-153']
i'm not going anywhere, sweetheart.:::['4-24-154']
i was laughing.:::['4-24-155']
out loud?:::['4-24-156']
i didn't want everyone to think i was stupid.:::['4-24-157']
my mom's driving me crazy. but ross is getting married!:::['4-24-159']
i'm happy. i won't let anything spoil that.:::['4-24-160']
i just want to say that ross is a wonderful young man.:::['4-24-162']
oh, thanks. we like him. ha, ha.:::['4-24-163']
my god! you must have been a teenager when you had him.:::['4-24-164']
there's no way in hell i'm paying for it.:::['4-24-165']
look, we're down to just one point.:::['4-24-166']
could we please just settle it after the wedding?:::['4-24-167']

german-if-it-weren't-for-us man!:::['4-24-169']
the guy was hammered. there's no way you look like ross' mother.:::['4-24-170']
then why would he say it? because he's crazy!:::['4-24-171']
earlier, he thanked me for my very moving performance in titanic.:::['4-24-172']
my mother's right. i'll never get married.:::['4-24-173']
ha! you know what, that is...:::['4-24-174']
who wouldn't want you?:::['4-24-175']

hello. where the hell have you been?:::['4-24-203']
i spent the night out. i met this cute bridesmaid. she is...:::['4-24-205']
i don't want to hear it!:::['4-24-206']
aw, pheebs, you know you're still my number one girl.:::['4-24-207']
we have an emergency. rachel's coming to london.:::['4-24-208']
oh, great!:::['4-24-209', '4-24-295']
no, she's coming to tell ross that she loves him.:::['4-24-210']
but he loves emily.:::['4-24-211']
i know that!:::['4-24-212']
you have to stop her. she's going to ruin the wedding.:::['4-24-213']
i've done my part, okay?:::['4-24-215']
it's your responsibility now. the burden is off me.:::['4-24-216']
so tell me about this girl.:::['4-24-218']

what's with the third degree? why don't you just shine a light in my eyes?:::['4-24-226']
then i realized all this stuff i had been doing......proposing to joshua,lying about why i couldn't come......was all just a way of...:::['4-24-227']
i'm sorry. can i interrupt?:::['4-24-229']
i just want to say that you are a horrible, horrible person.:::['4-24-230']
pardon me?:::['4-24-231']
you're about to ruin the happiest day of his life.:::['4-24-232']
i have to agree with your friend pheebs.:::['4-24-233']
this is a terrible, terrible plan.:::['4-24-234']
but he has to know how i feel. but why?:::['4-24-235']
he loves this emily. no good can come of this.:::['4-24-236']
ugh! i think you're wrong.:::['4-24-237']
by the way, it seems to be clear you were on a break.:::['4-24-239']
it's like a fairyland.:::['4-24-241']
i know. it's horrible, isn't it?:::['4-24-242']
i love it. i only hope my wedding looks this good.:::['4-24-243']

i'll cover the door. you watch that big hole.:::['4-24-247']
i've got chandler covering ross.:::['4-24-248']
why would i care where chandler is? heh.:::['4-24-249']
you know, uh......sometimes i don't even like chandler.:::['4-24-250']
ross: i do.:::['4-24-252']
oh, it's the second one.:::['4-24-254']

sorry, old boy.:::['4-24-276']
i could kill you with my thumb, you know.:::['4-24-278']
what was that about?:::['4-24-279']
it was this disagreement over...:::['4-24-280']
my god! you look beautiful.:::['4-24-281']
oh! you can't see me before the wedding. it's bad luck.:::['4-24-283']

hey. hey. wow, it is true what they say: pregnant bellies look like a drum.:::['4-18-0']
well, it's just i'm so pregnant that my guitar doesn't fit anymore.:::['4-18-2']
so i thought, till i'm not, i'm gonna play my songs on this drum. it sounds really cool.:::['4-18-3']
listen, listen. ahem. okay.:::['4-18-4']
smelly cat, smelly cat what are they feeding you?:::['4-18-5']

phoebe. phoebe. hi. hey.:::['4-18-8']
what are you doing here? um, actually i came down to ask you a big favor.:::['4-18-9']
oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.:::['4-18-10']
no, no, no. okay. now, see. ahem.:::['4-18-11']
i want to name the girl baby leslie.:::['4-18-12']
and, um, frank wants to name one of the boy babies... ...frank jr., jr.:::['4-18-13']
wouldn't that be frank iii? don't get me started.:::['4-18-14']
anyway, um, since there are three babies... ...and, um, we both got to put our names in......we would be truly honored:::['4-18-15']
if you would name the other boy baby.:::['4-18-16']
that's so nice. oh, oh! ha, ha.:::['4-18-18']
cougar.:::['4-18-19']
you think about it.:::['4-18-20']
i left a bra drying on the shower rod.:::['4-18-21']
you don't think your son will think it's yours and be traumatized?:::['4-18-22']
hey, mommy can have a wife. daddy can have a bra.:::['4-18-23']
oh, it's time to go. oh, no, no, no. see, that clock's a little fast.:::['4-18-24']
uh, we still have 17 minutes.:::['4-18-25']
huh. what can we do in 17 minutes... ...twice?:::['4-18-26']
well, that's ambitious.:::['4-18-27']
okay, you can ignore that. that's carol with your son.:::['4-18-28']
uh, believe me, when he's older, he'll understand.:::['4-18-29']
carol: ross. i'll be right there.:::['4-18-30']
hello. hello. hey. hi.:::['4-18-31']
uh, emily, this is carol and susan.:::['4-18-32']
hey, it's so nice to finally meet you. you too.:::['4-18-33']
susan's gonna be shooting a commercial in london next week. i'm so excited. i've never been there.:::['4-18-34']
oh, well, i'll show you around. susan: great.:::['4-18-35']
also, i was hoping to catch a show. so if you can make any suggestions...:::['4-18-36']
oh, there's tons of terrific stuff. i'll go with you. oh.:::['4-18-37']
oh. look at you two bonding.:::['4-18-39']
making us late for the airport so... are you all right?:::['4-18-40']
oh, he's fine, he's fine. it's just us getting along is difficult for him......because he doesn't like me.:::['4-18-41']
ha, ha. come on. that's... it's true.:::['4-18-42']
hi. hey. hey, do we have a baby name yet?:::['4-18-43']
ugh, no. it's so hard. i went through this whole book and found nothing.:::['4-18-44']
i want a name that's really, like, you know, strong and confident. you know? like exxon.:::['4-18-45']
well, it certainly worked for that valdez kid.:::['4-18-46']
oh, oh, pheebs. you want a strong name? how about the hulk?:::['4-18-47']
no, i'm not sure about hulk... ...but i like the idea of a name starting with "the.":::['4-18-48']
well, you want a good name, heh, go with joey.:::['4-18-49']
joey's your pal, joey's your buddy.:::['4-18-50']
where is everybody? they're hanging out with joey.:::['4-18-51']
know what? if you're gonna name him joey... ...you should name him chandler.:::['4-18-52']
oh, come on, chandler's funny, he's sophisticated, and he's very lovable......once you get to know him.:::['4-18-53']
hey, joey's lovable too.:::['4-18-54']
but the thing about joey is, if you need him, he'll be there.:::['4-18-55']
chandler will be there for you too. i mean, he might be a little late......but he'll be there.:::['4-18-56']
and he'll bring you some cold soda......if what you need him for:::['4-18-57']
is that you're really hot.:::['4-18-58']
what do you say? what do you say?:::['4-18-59']
well, i like the idea of naming him after someone i love.:::['4-18-60']
and joey and chandler are both great names.:::['4-18-61']
all right, i don't... maybe i will just name him the hulk.:::['4-18-62']
i knew i shouldn't have mentioned it. that's what i wanted to name my kid.:::['4-18-63']
hey, mon? if you were hoping to sleep with joshua for the first time tonight... ...which one of these would you want to be wearing?:::['4-18-64']
you know what? it really creeps me out choosing other people's sex clothes.:::['4-18-65']
sorry. i'm just so excited.:::['4-18-66']
i've been waiting for this for months. i got my hair colored. i got new sheets. i'm making him a very fancy meal.:::['4-18-67']
what am i making him, by the way?:::['4-18-68']
well, you're making him a frisée salad with goat cheese and pine nuts......wild rice, roasted asparagus:::['4-18-69']
and salmon en croute.:::['4-18-70']
i thought i was making him filet mignon.:::['4-18-71']
yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over.:::['4-18-72']
and then you realized if you bitched about it, then you would stop cooking......and you would have to make your:::['4-18-73']
famous baked potato and diet coke.:::['4-18-74']
wow, i really get crabby when i cook.:::['4-18-75']
so, uh, emily called last night.:::['4-18-78']
and now you're giving me the message?:::['4-18-79']
turns out that emily is just crazy about susan.:::['4-18-80']
yeah. they're going to the theater together.:::['4-18-81']
they're going to dinner.:::['4-18-82']
they're going horseback riding.:::['4-18-83']
god, susan is so fun.:::['4-18-84']
look, this is just a little too familiar.:::['4-18-85']
okay, for, like, six months before carol and i split up......all i heard was,"my friend susan is so smart.:::['4-18-86']
my friend susan is so funny. my friend susan is so great.":::['4-18-87']
you actually think that something could happen between emily and susan?:::['4-18-88']
hey, they're going to the gym together.:::['4-18-89']
two women... ...stretching.:::['4-18-90']
you know, they take a steam together, things get a little playful. didn't you see personal best?:::['4-18-91']
no, but i'm gonna.:::['4-18-92']
hi. hi. you're crazy.:::['4-18-93']
okay, this is emily. emily is straight.:::['4-18-94']
how do you know? i mean, we thought carol was straight before i married her.:::['4-18-95']
yeah, definitely. i don't like the name ross.:::['4-18-96']
what a weird way to kick me when i'm down.:::['4-18-97']
no, no, i just meant for the baby.:::['4-18-98']
what's wrong with ross?:::['4-18-100']
it's just, you know, something like this... ...would never happen to the hulk, you know.:::['4-18-101']
actually, that's not true.:::['4-18-102']
in the incredible hulk, number 72, dr. bruce banner found...:::['4-18-103']
you know, never mind. my girlfriend's a lesbian.:::['4-18-104']
so i decided i'm definitely gonna go with either joey or chandler.:::['4-18-105']
oh. oh, oh, oh. you gotta pick joey. i mean, name one famous person named chandler.:::['4-18-106']
raymond chandler. someone you didn't make up.:::['4-18-107']
okay, there are no famous joeys. except for, heh... ...joey buttafuoco.:::['4-18-108']
yeah, that guy really hurt us. phoebe: yeah.:::['4-18-109']
well, how about a compromise then? okay, what if it's......you know, chan-no-ey?:::['4-18-110']
okay, look, joey? come on, think about it. he'll never be president.:::['4-18-111']
i mean, there's never gonna be a president joey.:::['4-18-112']
all right, look, i didn't want to bring this up.:::['4-18-113']
but chandler is the stupidest name i've heard in my life.:::['4-18-114']
it's not even a name. it's barely even a word.:::['4-18-115']
okay, it's kind of like chandelier but it's not.:::['4-18-116']
all right? it's a stupid, stupid, non-name.:::['4-18-117']
you're right. i have a horrible, horrible name.:::['4-18-119']
i'm sorry, man. i didn't... i'm sorry.:::['4-18-120']
so i guess it's joey, then. i mean...:::['4-18-121']
this is so nice. thank you for doing this.:::['4-18-122']
oh. please. cooking soothes me.:::['4-18-123']
so dig in. all right.:::['4-18-124']
well, it all looks so good. mm.:::['4-18-125']
oh, i know. my god, this rice is so... i am so good.:::['4-18-128']
behind you.:::['4-18-129']
oh, yeah, sorry. they used to live here, and sometimes they migrate back over.:::['4-18-130']
is there, uh...? is there some way that they could, uh, not be here? it's just that, uh, farm birds really kind of freak me out.:::['4-18-131']
yeah. okay, okay. okay, great.:::['4-18-132']
here we go. here we go. whoa.:::['4-18-133']
whoa. oh, sorry.:::['4-18-134']
hey. how'd you do that? come on.:::['4-18-136']
all gone. heh.:::['4-18-137']
so, farm birds, huh?:::['4-18-138']
yeah, it's my only weird thing, i swear.:::['4-18-139']
and i would have told you about it but i didn't know that they'd be here.:::['4-18-140']
oh. so, uh, ahem.:::['4-18-141']
ha, ha. okay.:::['4-18-142', '3-13-100']
so can i serve you a little... what, what, what?:::['4-18-143']
nothing. uh, it's just that i know that they're still out there.:::['4-18-144']
they're across the hall. i mean, that's two doors away.:::['4-18-145']
it's gonna take them a long time to peck their way back over here.:::['4-18-146']
that's not funny.:::['4-18-147']
uh... okay, you know...:::['4-18-148']
would you feel better if we went someplace else? i mean, we could pack all this stuff up and, you know, go to your apartment.:::['4-18-149']
oh, they're working on it this week. it's a mess.:::['4-18-150']
but, uh, i'm staying at my parents' house. we could go there.:::['4-18-151']
your parents'? they're out of town.:::['4-18-152']
it's a huge place, and it's got this gorgeous view of the park. it'd be very, very romantic.:::['4-18-154']
what do you say? yeah, that works.:::['4-18-155']
they can smell the fear.:::['4-18-156']
how's ben?:::['4-18-158']
well, i asked him if he wanted to eat. he said no.:::['4-18-159']
i asked him if he wanted to sleep. he said no.:::['4-18-160']
i asked what he wanted to do. he said no.:::['4-18-161']
so he's sweeping.:::['4-18-162']
hey, buddy. hey.:::['4-18-163']
so, um, any word from susan?:::['4-18-164']
ooh, yeah, she said she's having so much fun with emily.:::['4-18-165']
uh, by the by, did it ever occur to you that......i don't know, maybe they might:::['4-18-167']
be having a little too much fun?:::['4-18-168']
what's too much fun?:::['4-18-169']
you know, the kind of fun you and susan had when we were married.:::['4-18-170']
oh, my god. you are so paranoid.:::['4-18-171']
am i? yes. am i?:::['4-18-172']
i can't speak for emily... ...but susan is in a loving, committed relationship.:::['4-18-173']
uh-huh. carol, so were we.:::['4-18-174']
all right, just imagine for a moment......that susan meets someone,and they really hit it off.:::['4-18-175']
say they're coming back from the theater... ...and they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks.:::['4-18-176']
they're laughing, you know. someone innocently touches someone else.:::['4-18-177']
there's electricity. it's new. it's exciting.:::['4-18-178']
are you telling me there isn't even the slightest possibility... ...of something happening?:::['4-18-179']
maybe. oh, my god. i didn't really believe it until you just said it.:::['4-18-180']
none of the other kids believed me, i swear to god, that duck pushed me.:::['4-18-181']
wow. this place is fabulous.:::['4-18-182']
yeah, let me show you around. this is the downstairs living room.:::['4-18-183']
there's two living rooms?:::['4-18-184']
god, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.:::['4-18-185']
yeah, well, it would have been, but, uh, my parents just moved here.:::['4-18-186']
well, you should know this place is a real babe magnet.:::['4-18-187']
want to make out?:::['4-18-188']
you know, here's an idea. why don't i put the food in the fridge... ...and we can eat it later?:::['4-18-189']
that sounds like a plan. heh.:::['4-18-190']
um, is there a place that i could go freshen up?:::['4-18-191']
oh, yeah. yeah. um, just down the hall and, uh, second door to your left.:::['4-18-192']
oh, hi, darling. mom, dad, what are you guys doing here?:::['4-18-193']
oh, we cut the trip short. france sucks.:::['4-18-194']
um, this may be a little weird, but i've got a date here.:::['4-18-195']
say no more. we'll just grab some food, take it with us upstairs and be out of your hair.:::['4-18-196']
oh, that'd be great. so you didn't even get to italy? yep. sucks.:::['4-18-197']
hi, you.:::['4-18-198']
oh, my god. i know. i can do more than cook.:::['4-18-199']
i like her. she seems smart.:::['4-18-201']
rachel, my parents.:::['4-18-202']
so nice to meet you. hello, hello.:::['4-18-203']
oh, joshua, that $500 was for groceries.:::['4-18-204']
what, this? oh, no. that's not what it is.:::['4-18-205']
okay, i work in fashion.:::['4-18-206']
see, and this is a real dress, actually. they're wearing it in milan.:::['4-18-207']
so part of my job is to wear the clothes and then i see how people respond.:::['4-18-208']
and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale's, so...:::['4-18-209']
and obviously, in this case... ...i am going to report back::::['4-18-210']
"u.s.a. not ready.":::['4-18-211']
maybe in l.a. yes.:::['4-18-212']
there you go. so have you kids eaten yet?:::['4-18-213']
well, ahem, we were going to do that after. i mean, um...:::['4-18-214']
next. well, we're starving.:::['4-18-215']
why don't we just all go get something to eat?:::['4-18-216']
yeah, well, ha, ha, no use wasting this baby just lying around the house.:::['4-18-217']
so we'll go eat. rachel: yeah. you'll wear that.:::['4-18-218']
we'll be eating and, of course, you'll be wearing that.:::['4-18-219']
dude, i am sorry about what i said.:::['4-18-220']
nope, nope, you're right. it is a ridiculous name.:::['4-18-221']
it's not that bad. yes, it is.:::['4-18-222']
from now on, i have no first name.:::['4-18-223']
so you're just bing?:::['4-18-224']
i have no name.:::['4-18-225']
so, what are we supposed to call you?:::['4-18-226']
okay, uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me......clint.:::['4-18-227']
no way are you cool enough to pull off "clint.":::['4-18-228']
okay, so, what name am i cool enough to pull off?:::['4-18-229']
um, gene.:::['4-18-230']
it's clint. it's clint.:::['4-18-231']
see you later, gene. phoebe: bye, gene.:::['4-18-232']
it's clint. clint!:::['4-18-233']
what's up with gene?:::['4-18-234']
you wore your nightie to dinner? oh, yeah.:::['4-18-235']
and the best part though, was when the waiter spilled water down my back.:::['4-18-236']
i jumped up and my boob popped out.:::['4-18-237']
oh, my god. oh, no. yeah, it's all right. i got nice boobs.:::['4-18-238']
so i just picked up a message from emily.:::['4-18-239']
she and susan are going to a poetry reading together.:::['4-18-240']
so? so? poetry?:::['4-18-241']
susan's gay. they're being gay together.:::['4-18-242']
emily's straight. oh, wake up.:::['4-18-243']
wow. carol really messed you up. excuse me?:::['4-18-244']
she turned you into this untrusting, crazy, jealous sycophant.:::['4-18-245']
all right, so i don't know what "sycophant" means, but the rest is right.:::['4-18-246']
i don't know what you're talking about. i am not a crazy, jealous person.:::['4-18-247']
what? she's totally right.:::['4-18-249']
when we were together, you got all freaked out about mark......and there was nothing going on.:::['4-18-250']
this makes sense. it does not.:::['4-18-251']
sure it does. in high school, you weren't jealous at all......even though all your girlfriends:::['4-18-252']
were cheating on you.:::['4-18-253']
all right, so up until '92, '93, he was very trusting.:::['4-18-254']
then '94 hit, carol left him, and bam. paranoid city.:::['4-18-255']
absolutely, absolutely. this is so much fun.:::['4-18-257']
this is not fun.:::['4-18-258']
look, all we're trying to say is... ...don't let what happened with carol ruin what you've got with emily.:::['4-18-259']
the '92 ross wouldn't.:::['4-18-260']
i still think i was right about that whole mark thing, though.:::['4-18-261']
wha...? well, you know what? i hope emily is a lesbian.:::['4-18-262']
drum roll.:::['4-18-263']
help. am i a mark or a john?:::['4-18-266']
ehh, you're not tall enough to be a mark.:::['4-18-267']
but you might make a good barney.:::['4-18-268']
all right, look, i am serious. tomorrow at 3:30, i'm going to the courthouse.:::['4-18-269']
you're actually going through with this?:::['4-18-270']
hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.:::['4-18-271']
okay, it's probably why kids picked on me and why i never do well with women.:::['4-18-272']
so as of 4:00 tomorrow, i'm either gonna be mark johnson or john markson.:::['4-18-273']
you've got problems because of you, not your name.:::['4-18-274']
this has got to stop. chandler is a great name.:::['4-18-275']
in fact... yes.:::['4-18-276']
i'm sorry, i know you really wanted me to name the baby joey.:::['4-18-277']
but... so i'm gonna name the baby chandler.:::['4-18-278']
really? yeah, but you have to keep the name too.:::['4-18-279']
okay, thanks. phoebe: okay.:::['4-18-280']
you want to hug it out? yeah.:::['4-18-281']
yay, yay. oh, yay! chandler: yay. okay, i'm gonna go tell frank and alice right now.:::['4-18-282']
bye, pheebs. okay, bye.:::['4-18-284']
flight 004 is now arriving at gate 17.:::['4-18-286']
nice luggage. i was going to say.:::['4-18-287']
i missed you. oh, i missed you too.:::['4-18-289']
thanks for everything, i had a great time. oh, so did i.:::['4-18-290']

monica, you don't even have a bed. you sleep in a ball on the floor!:::['4-19-16']
you know what? i am tired of your bellyaching. i've worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live.:::['4-19-17']
i know. i'm so sorry. i'm sorry, okay?:::['4-19-18']
this is a great apartment.:::['4-19-19']
shut up. this place is a hole.:::['4-19-20']
oh, blimey, i still can't believe you've got an earring!:::['4-19-21']
i know, i know. who am i? david bowie?:::['4-19-22']
he does that?:::['4-19-23']
i don't know. whatever. ha, ha.:::['4-19-24']
well, i think it makes you look really dangerous.:::['4-19-25']
oh, i know. ha-ha-ha.:::['4-19-26']
i never would've gotten this if it weren't for you.:::['4-19-28']
no, really. when i'm with you, i'm like......this whole other guy.:::['4-19-29']
i love that guy!:::['4-19-30']
i mean, i love you too. a lot.:::['4-19-31']
but that guy! i love that guy!:::['4-19-32']
i love both of you. ah, heh.:::['4-19-33']
i wish i didn't have to go.:::['4-19-34']
then don't.:::['4-19-35']
stay here. don't go so soon to london. just one more day. oh, ross.:::['4-19-36']
one more day. please don't do this to me again.:::['4-19-37']
you know i'd stay, but i've already missed so much work. they'll fire me.:::['4-19-38']
so? then you could stay as long as you want.:::['4-19-39']
i wish i could.:::['4-19-40']
oh, no, don't... don't... don't start packing. come on.:::['4-19-41']
i don't think you understand packing.:::['4-19-42']
i don't want to leave it till the last minute. last time i packed in a rush, i left my knickers here.:::['4-19-43']
yeah, i know. i, uh, tried them on.:::['4-19-44']
you didn't!:::['4-19-45']
no, i didn't. i didn't want to be "that guy.":::['4-19-46']
ho, ho, ho.:::['4-19-48']
excuse me? your pants.:::['4-19-49']
oh, yeah! you like them?:::['4-19-50']
i went to a used-clothes store and got maternity stuff.:::['4-19-51']
these are so comfortable.:::['4-19-52']
uh, pheebs, those are, uh, santa pants.:::['4-19-53']
what? santa pants.:::['4-19-54']
santa claus' pants.:::['4-19-55']
nuh-uh. they're maternity pants.:::['4-19-56']
they even came with a list of baby names. see?:::['4-19-57']
these names are good, and these are bad.:::['4-19-58']
hey! hey.:::['4-19-60']
rachel: hey, pheebs. so, how are the elves?:::['4-19-61']
i don't know. how are the, uh, you know?:::['4-19-62']
your clothes aren't funny.:::['4-19-63']
hey, guys, what should i wear to a knicks game?:::['4-19-64']
uh, a t-shirt that says, "i don't belong here"?:::['4-19-65']
you have tickets?:::['4-19-66']
mom got dad's season tickets in the divorce, so she gave them to me.:::['4-19-67']
apparently, they're good seats.:::['4-19-68']
oh, my god! those are almost on the floor!:::['4-19-69']
do you guys want these?:::['4-19-70']
yeah! yeah, we do!:::['4-19-71']
well, you got them!:::['4-19-72']
all right! just give us our apartment back.:::['4-19-73']
whoa, i didn't see that coming.:::['4-19-74']
come on. we know what these are worth.:::['4-19-76']
do you think we're stupid?:::['4-19-77']
not stupid. you're meaner than i thought.:::['4-19-78']
what do you say? forget it.:::['4-19-79']
okay? i'm not giving up my bachelor pad for basketball seats.:::['4-19-80']
your "bachelor pad"? have you even had a girl here?:::['4-19-81']
but joey has, and i usually talk to them in the morning time.:::['4-19-83']
gunther, can i get two cups of chino, please?:::['4-19-86']
good one.:::['4-19-87']
come on. season tickets. season tickets! you know what that means?:::['4-19-88']
forget it. i'm not giving up the apartment.:::['4-19-89']
when i was a kid, my dad's company gave season tickets... ...to the number 1 salesman every year. all right? my dad never won.:::['4-19-90']
of course, he wasn't in sales. but still, i never forgot that!:::['4-19-91']
hey guys! hey.:::['4-19-92']
we don't make enough fun of you already?:::['4-19-94']
oh, yeah. emily convinced me to do it.:::['4-19-95']
you do know that wham broke up?:::['4-19-96']
ah! ha, ha.:::['4-19-97']
i like it. and emily likes it. and that's what counts.:::['4-19-98']
so, uh, how are you guys doing?:::['4-19-99']
don't try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.:::['4-19-100']
where's emily? ugh, she's saying goodbye to her uncle.:::['4-19-101']
didn't she, like, just get here? yeah! yeah.:::['4-19-102']
easy, tiger.:::['4-19-103']
i just hate this so much.:::['4-19-104']
every time i go pick her up at the airport, it's so great.:::['4-19-105']
but i'm thinking, "i'll be right back in a couple of days, dropping her off.":::['4-19-106']
so, what'll you do? there's nothing to do.:::['4-19-107']
she lives there. i live here. she'd have to move here.:::['4-19-108']
she should move here.:::['4-19-109']
i can ask her to live with me. are you serious?:::['4-19-111']
why not? i mean, why not? you've only known her six weeks!:::['4-19-112']
i've got a carton of milk in my fridge i've had a longer relationship with.:::['4-19-113']
look, guys, when i'm with her, it's like... uh, she brings out this great side of me.:::['4-19-114']
i mean, i love her, you know?:::['4-19-115']
and i love the milk!:::['4-19-116']
but i won't ask some british girl to move in with me.:::['4-19-117']
joey, you say things now.:::['4-19-118']
look, ross. he's right. emily's great. she's great!:::['4-19-119']
but this is too soon. you're only gonna scare her.:::['4-19-120']
i don't wanna do that. joey: no. you don't want to wreck it. don't go too fast.:::['4-19-121']
no. you're right. i know, you're right. i'm not going to do it.:::['4-19-122']
thanks guys. no problem.:::['4-19-123']
just remember to wake us up before you go-go.:::['4-19-124']
it's too hard. too hard!:::['4-19-125']
all right, boys. last chance for the tickets.:::['4-19-126']
otherwise, i give them to my new boyfriend, joshua.:::['4-19-127']
wait, wait. come on, come on! let's trade.:::['4-19-129']
the timing's perfect! i just clogged the toilet!:::['4-19-130']
i want those seats as much as you. but we can't live in the small apartment......after we've lived here!:::['4-19-131']
ever read flowers for algernon?:::['4-19-132']
yes. ever read sports illustrated?:::['4-19-133']
no, i didn't read yours!:::['4-19-134']
we can go to the game tonight!:::['4-19-135']
the only way i'll consider this... ...is if they offer more than just season seats.:::['4-19-136']
it's the knicks! screw the knicks. whoa!:::['4-19-137']
i didn't mean that. i just meant... ...that the apartment is worth so much more.:::['4-19-138']
and the knicks rule all. yeah, the knicks rule all!:::['4-19-140']
hey, so? are you going to do it?:::['4-19-141']
no, we're not going to because it's not an even trade.:::['4-19-142']
what if you could keep the apartment and the tickets?:::['4-19-144']
let me finish. i'm talking about a bet. winner takes all.:::['4-19-146']
ooh, we could get nothing. or you can end up with everything. oh, i like that.:::['4-19-147']
no! just do it!:::['4-19-149']
oh! oh, i'm convinced!:::['4-19-150']
come on, man! you know i'd do it for you.:::['4-19-151']
because you're my best friend.:::['4-19-152']
all right. but you can't use that again for a whole year.:::['4-19-153']
this is so exciting! what are you going to bet?:::['4-19-155']
okay. well, we should let phoebe decide......because she's the only one:::['4-19-156']
who's impartial, and she's so pretty.:::['4-19-157']
okay. ha, ha. um...:::['4-19-158']
ooh, ooh. oh, i have a game!:::['4-19-159']

that's not even a game.:::['4-19-169']
shut up. we're winning!:::['4-19-170']
you want to finish this? we get a deck of cards. high card wins. what do you say?:::['4-19-171']

no, they didn't.:::['4-19-202']
packed while you were gone.:::['4-19-204']
i left some knickers under your pillow.:::['4-19-205']
move in with me.:::['4-19-206']
don't be scared. it sounds crazy, and people will say it's too soon......but just think.:::['4-19-208']
think how great it would be.:::['4-19-209']
uh, oh, leaving london.:::['4-19-212']
my whole family lives there... i know.:::['4-19-213']
my job. you'll get a job here.:::['4-19-214']
i always hear about them foreigners stealing american jobs.:::['4-19-215']
that could be you.:::['4-19-216']
yeah, but it's my whole life.:::['4-19-217']
you come to england.:::['4-19-218']
i can't. i would. i really would. but my son is here.:::['4-19-219']
i can't leave him. you don't think there's any way?:::['4-19-220']
it would be different if it was way into the future......and we were getting married:::['4-19-222']
or something.:::['4-19-223']
uh, no, right. i shouldn't have said "married." uh, please don't go freaky on me.:::['4-19-225']
i didn't mean it. i didn't say it. i take it back.:::['4-19-226']
no. don't.:::['4-19-227']
why don't we?:::['4-19-228']
why don't we what?:::['4-19-229']
get married.:::['4-19-230']
you are mad!:::['4-19-231']
no, i'm not! it's perfect. it's better than you moving here.:::['4-19-232']
it's us together forever, and that's what i want.:::['4-19-233']
we've known each other six weeks! yeah, i know.:::['4-19-234']
so what? who's to say? does that mean we can't do it?:::['4-19-235']
look. i was with carol for four years before we got married......and i wound up divorced:::['4-19-236']
from a pregnant lesbian.:::['4-19-237']
i mean, this... this makes sense for us.:::['4-19-238']
come on. our first date, we ended up spending the whole weekend in vermont.:::['4-19-239']
i mean, last night i got my ear pierced. me!:::['4-19-240']
this feels right. doesn't it?:::['4-19-241']
my parents are gonna be really mad.:::['4-19-242']
is that...? are you saying "yes"? is that "yes"?:::['4-19-243']

emily, will you marry me?:::['4-19-250']
oh, it's a bit small.:::['4-19-252']
damn! i thought that'd be romantic as hell.:::['4-19-253']
it was.:::['4-19-254']
those were, like, the best seats ever. oh, yeah.:::['4-19-255']
hey, should we give these to the girls? like a peace offering?:::['4-19-256']
that's very nice. plus, they were free and too small.:::['4-19-257']
joey: hey, you want a beer?:::['4-19-259', '3-6-235']
whoa! i know!:::['4-19-260']
open up! open up! open up!:::['4-19-261']
we'll discuss it in the morning.:::['4-19-262']
what the hell is going on?:::['4-19-263']
we took our apartment back!:::['4-19-264']
i had nothing to do with it.:::['4-19-265']
okay, it was my idea. but i don't feel good about it.:::['4-19-266']
we are switching back right now.:::['4-19-268']
no, we're not. we're not leaving!:::['4-19-269']
you'll have to. you both have jobs.:::['4-19-270']
as soon as you do, we're switching back! there's nothing you can do to stop us.:::['4-19-271']
right, joe?:::['4-19-272']
i don't want to move again, with...:::['4-19-275']
i don't care! this is our apartment and they stole...:::['4-19-276']
you stole!:::['4-19-277']
our apartment! we won it fair and square. twice!:::['4-19-278']
and i am getting it back right now! i'm getting it back right now!:::['4-19-279']
we figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.:::['4-19-281']
oh, no more offers. you can't offer anything to us!:::['4-19-282']
let us keep the apartment and... as a thank you......rachel and i will kiss:::['4-19-283']
for one minute.:::['4-19-284']
totally worth it. that was one good minute.:::['4-19-285']
men are such idiots. i know.:::['4-19-287']
can you believe something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?:::['4-19-288']
it's funny. if you had just done that after the last contest... ...no one would have had to move at all. ha, ha.:::['4-19-289']
let's pretend that's not true. yeah.:::['4-19-290']
okay. scarf's done.:::['4-19-291']
come on. come on, come on! chandler: okay.:::['4-19-292']
phoebe: hey! ross: hey.:::['4-19-293']

well, okay. it's, uh... ahem.:::['4-19-296']
emily and i, we decided to, uh... ...to get married.:::['4-19-297']
oh, are you pregnant too?:::['4-19-299']
when did...? how did you...?:::['4-19-301']
we just decided to go for it.:::['4-19-302']
we know it's a bit hasty, but, uh... ...it just feels so right.:::['4-19-303']
um, i was just telling the guys... yeah, i heard.:::['4-19-304']
i think it's great! aah!:::['4-19-305']
i'm so happy for you!:::['4-19-306']
well, yeah! congratulations!:::['4-19-307']
i can't believe you're getting married! yeah.:::['4-19-308']
monica and rachel made out.:::['4-19-309']
morning's here:::['4-19-310']
the morning's here sunshine is here the sky is clear:::['4-19-311']
the morning's here:::['4-19-312']
hey, you're back! hey!:::['4-19-313']
get into gear breakfast is near the dark of night has disappeared:::['4-19-314']

it seems like all of a sudden, so much is happening.:::['4-21-0']
i know. ross is getting married.:::['4-21-1']
phoebe's making people.:::['4-21-2']
everybody's doing stuff. we just sit here.:::['4-21-3']
if i died, the only way people would know i was here......would be by the ass print:::['4-21-4']
on this chair.:::['4-21-5']
look, we have to do something. okay? something huge.:::['4-21-6']
we could climb mount everest.:::['4-21-7']
no, no. not something stupid. something huge.:::['4-21-8']
no, no, no. i saw an ad for this video.:::['4-21-9']
people climb that thing every day. we could totally do that.:::['4-21-10']
why not? i mean, it's just climbing.:::['4-21-11']
it's just steep.:::['4-21-12']
we're going to everest. okay? it'd be nice to leave an ass print on everest.:::['4-21-14']
what's up? we're gonna climb mount everest.:::['4-21-16']
yeah, baby. really?:::['4-21-17']
i looked into that.:::['4-21-18']
yeah, but, i mean, it costs like $60,000, and, you know, you could die. and...:::['4-21-19']
and you would die.:::['4-21-20']
we could get that everest video.:::['4-21-22']
yeah, we could do that without, you know, risking our lives at all.:::['4-21-23']
while we're down at the video store, we could rent die hard.:::['4-21-24']
oh. you know what? i just remembered.:::['4-21-25']
that everest thing is only available through mail order.:::['4-21-26']
so you guys will stay here and hang out with me?:::['4-21-28']
joey: yeah. yeah. chandler: yeah.:::['4-21-29']
but i'll tell you, one of these days......we're gonna get off our butts:::['4-21-30']
and rent die hard again.:::['4-21-31']
so, what did we decide? does your uncle nathan get an invite or not?:::['4-21-33']
oh, god. nobody likes him.:::['4-21-34']
and he's so cheap. he'd never fly to london in a million years.:::['4-21-35']
yeah, invite him.:::['4-21-36']
hey, did i do these neat enough?:::['4-21-37']
yeah, they're fine. yeah?:::['4-21-38']

oh. so you invited rachel then?:::['4-21-40']
sure, why not?:::['4-21-41']
well, i don't think i'd be comfortable having any of my old lovers there.:::['4-21-43']
wait, wait, wait. do you think we shouldn't invite her?:::['4-21-44']
oh, no, no, ross, you know i absolutely adore rachel.:::['4-21-45']

the way you owned up to everything... ...it just showed me how much you've grown, you know?:::['4-21-137']
i mean, my mom never thought this would work out.:::['4-21-138', '4-1-282']
she was all, "once a cheater, always a cheater.":::['4-21-139']
i just wish we hadn't lost those four months.:::['4-21-142', '4-1-285']
but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective...:::['4-21-143', '4-1-286']
we were on a break!:::['4-21-144', '4-1-150']
yeah, but what am i gonna do? we agreed it was gonna be a two-week thing.:::['4-21-146']
ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends... ...asking to hear stories about you......looking through monica's photo albums.:::['4-21-148']
you think? heh.:::['4-21-150']
you've got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.:::['4-21-151']
and you're sitting here in a hallway... ...with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.:::['4-21-152']
yeah, you're right. yeah.:::['4-21-153']
oh, this is so amazing.:::['4-21-154']

i'm so jealous you're all going. i can't believe i never knew you can't fly in your third trimester.:::['4-21-164']
chandler: i never knew that. monica: i didn't, either.:::['4-21-165']
so didn't know that. but you should see your faces.:::['4-21-167']

we're hanging out.:::['4-21-169']
what's this? is this ross' wedding invitation?:::['4-21-170']
maybe that's the one we should have actually hidden.:::['4-21-171']
oh, no. no, you guys, come on. you don't have to do that. i'm happy for him.:::['4-21-172']
i am. i really... i'm... i'm ha...:::['4-21-173']

rach, you're going to come though, aren't you?:::['4-21-177']
oh, honey, i don't know. i...:::['4-21-178']
this isn't one of those "if she doesn't come, we don't come"? because i already bought my ticket...:::['4-21-179']
you know what would be real weird? if you weren't there.:::['4-21-180']
just say you'll think about it, okay? no, i'll think about it. yeah.:::['4-21-181']
who's this from? that's ross'.:::['4-21-182']

i saw this pin, and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had... ...when i was a little girl. oh.:::['4-21-187']
i can't believe he remembered.:::['4-21-188']
this must have cost him a fortune. i can't believe he did this.:::['4-21-189']
remember back in college when he fell in love with carol... ...and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?:::['4-21-190']
flight number 457 from beijing now arriving.:::['4-21-193']
we were in school together. we haven't seen each other since then.:::['4-21-195']

ross, hi. it's rachel.:::['4-21-206']
i'm just calling to say that, um, everything's fine.:::['4-21-207']
and i'm really happy for you... ...and your cat.:::['4-21-208']
so obviously, i am over you.:::['4-21-209']
and that, my friend, is what they call closure.:::['4-21-211']
rach, i got a message from you.:::['4-21-212']
oh, my god, no. hang up the phone. give me the phone. give me the phone, give me the phone. give me the phone!:::['4-21-213']

basically, ahem... ...lately, i've, uh...:::['4-21-218']
ahem. i've sort of had feelings for you.:::['4-21-219']
he broke up with julie.:::['4-21-221']
well, go hug her, for god's sakes.:::['4-21-222']
it's always been you, rach. oh, god.:::['4-21-224']
both: oh...:::['4-21-225']
oh, that's okay. you're worth the wait. oh.:::['4-21-227']
i never dreamed that i'd meet somebody like you:::['4-21-230']
i never dreamed that i'd lose somebody like you:::['4-21-231']
no, i don't want to fall in love:::['4-21-232']
rachel: oh, god!:::['4-21-233']
oh. honey.:::['4-21-234']
oh, no, you just rolled over the juice box.:::['4-21-236']
gunther, please tell me you didn't say anything to rachel... ...about me and the girl from the copy place.:::['4-21-237']
i'm sorry. was i not supposed to?:::['4-21-238']
you're the one who ended it.:::['4-21-239']
yeah, because i was mad at you. not because i stopped loving you.:::['4-21-240', '3-25-269']
you still love me? no.:::['4-21-241', '3-25-270']
what does this mean? what do you...? i mean, do you want to get back together?:::['4-21-242']
no. maybe.:::['4-21-243', '3-25-276']
i don't... i don't know. what?:::['4-21-244']
i just... i feel...:::['4-21-245', '3-25-282']
i can't believe i even thought of getting back together with you. we are so over.:::['4-21-246', '4-1-301']
and, hey, just so you know, it's not that common......it doesn't happen to every guy,and it is a big deal!:::['4-21-248']

dad, turn it off.:::['4-21-259']
jack: it is off. rachel: yeah. jack: right, ross?:::['4-21-260']
i can't go to my own prom without a date. i can't. it's too late.:::['4-21-262']
if you're not going, then i don't wanna go either.:::['4-21-263']
i have a wonderful idea. you should take rachel to the prom.:::['4-21-264']
we've seen enough. let's turn it off. phoebe: i want to see. fine, i'm not going to watch, all right?:::['4-21-265']
come on, kid. let's go.:::['4-21-266']
judy: are you handsome. jack: let's show them.:::['4-21-267']
okay, dad. rachel, ready or not.:::['4-21-268']
here comes your knight in shining... oh, no.:::['4-21-269']
monica: bye. don't wait up. rachel: okay, chip, let's go.:::['4-21-270']
judy: oh, dear. jack, how do i turn this off?:::['4-21-271']
i can't believe you did that. yeah, well...:::['4-21-272']
see? he's her lobster.:::['4-21-273']
no. you're really not going? yeah.:::['4-21-274']
it's just going to be too hard.:::['4-21-275']
you know, i mean... ...it's ross.:::['4-21-276']
how can i watch him get married?:::['4-21-277']
you know? it's just for the best, you know? it is.:::['4-21-278']
plus somebody's got to stay here with phoebe. she's going to be pretty big by then......and she'll need someone:::['4-21-279']
to help her tie her shoes.:::['4-21-280']
drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labor.:::['4-21-281']
you don't have a car. and your license expired. i know.:::['4-21-282']
yeah. see, there's so much to do, and i have so little time to do it in.:::['4-21-283']
check this out. it says there's a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums.:::['4-21-284']
"it's almost as good as being there.":::['4-21-285']
it's better. you can't go to a museum in your underwear.:::['4-21-286']
well, you could, but probably just the one time.:::['4-21-287']
i bet we could get videos of all the sights......get a vcr in our hotel room,we'd never even have to go outside.:::['4-21-288']
if we do that, we've got to rent die hard.:::['4-21-289']
oh-ho, i bet the british version is good.:::['4-21-290']
are you kidding me?:::['4-20-0']
joey? joey? joey, joey, joey, joey, joey, joey, joey!:::['4-20-1']
joey. joey. joey. joey, joey!:::['4-20-2']
oh. oh, did i wake you?:::['4-20-4']
gunther, could i get another cup of coffee?:::['4-20-5']
so, uh, what do you do when you're not working here?:::['4-20-6']
you don't need to fill these silences. okay, thanks.:::['4-20-7']
chandler, that's your fourth cup of coffee.:::['4-20-8']
i'm drinking lots because i'm exhausted because joey started snoring.:::['4-20-9']
he's in a different room. he's that loud?:::['4-20-10']
oh, you should hear me.:::['4-20-11']
it's not something to be proud of. go to a sleep clinic.:::['4-20-12']
i told you, i'm not going to any clinic.:::['4-20-13']
i don't have a problem. you're the one with the problem.:::['4-20-14']
you should go to a "quit-being- a-baby-and-leave-me-alone" clinic.:::['4-20-15']
they don't have those. yeah, they do.:::['4-20-16']
quit being a baby and leave me alone!:::['4-20-17']
there, you just had your first class.:::['4-20-18']
i used to go out with this guy that was a light sleeper.:::['4-20-19']
and whenever i'd snore, he'd roll me over...:::['4-20-20']
he'd roll me over, and i'd stop snoring.:::['4-20-22']
next time you snore, i'm rolling you over!:::['4-20-23']
i gotta do what i gotta do. you gotta do what you gotta do.:::['4-20-24']
oh, the olympics!:::['4-20-26']
have you picked a date? huh? oh. no. not yet.:::['4-20-27']
i still can not believe you're engaged.:::['4-20-28']
just because it's happening so fast. not because you're a loser.:::['4-20-29']
thanks. uh, has anyone seen rach?:::['4-20-30']
mm, she's upstairs not doing the dishes.:::['4-20-31']
and i'll tell you, i'm not doing them this time. i don't care if those dishes sit until they're covered...:::['4-20-32']
i'll do them when i get home.:::['4-20-33']
yeah. oh, hey. um, emily found this wedding dress in london...:::['4-20-34']
already? yeah, but it didn't fit.:::['4-20-35']
luckily, there's a store here with one left in her size.:::['4-20-36']
but i'm the groom...:::['4-20-37']
i'll pick it up for you. thank you.:::['4-20-38']
she's got you running errands, picking up wedding dresses...:::['4-20-39']
ha-ha-ha. wah-pah!:::['4-20-40']
what's "wah-pah"?:::['4-20-41']
you know. whipped. wah-pah!:::['4-20-42']
that's not whipped. whipped is::::['4-20-43']
that's what i did. wah-pah!:::['4-20-44']
you can't do anything!:::['4-20-45']
rachel: hey, mon. i was just doing these dishes. oh... hey.:::['4-20-46']
hi. do you, uh, have a minute? yeah, i was just about to take a break anyway.:::['4-20-47']
so listen, uh......i know you and i haven't:::['4-20-48']
had a chance to talk... ...since, uh, emily and i decided to get married.:::['4-20-49']
and i was just wondering how you were.:::['4-20-50']
ahem. oh. if you were getting married, heh, i would feel kind of...:::['4-20-51']
you know? yeah, yeah.:::['4-20-52']
it def... uh, it definitely took me by surprise. but, you know......uh, i'm okay.:::['4-20-53']
i just wanted to check. oh, that's sweet. thank you. oh, ha, ha.:::['4-20-55']
you're great. hmm.:::['4-20-56']
and i know someday this will happen for you too.:::['4-20-57']
you just hang in there. ahem.:::['4-20-58']
uh, heh.:::['4-20-59']
"hang in there"?:::['4-20-60']
oh, no, i didn't mean...:::['4-20-61']
you haven't heard of a serious relationship called "me and joshua"?:::['4-20-62']
oh. i thought you had just been on four dates. i didn't realize that had become anything.:::['4-20-63']
oh, yeah. oh, no, it has become.:::['4-20-64']
yeah. oh, no, those were four great dates.:::['4-20-65']
oh. yeah? oh, yeah.:::['4-20-66']
i mean, and the connection! i mean, you know.:::['4-20-67']
emotionally, mentally. you know?:::['4-20-68']
physically.:::['4-20-69']
wow. that's incredible. i know, isn't it?:::['4-20-70']
i'm right there with joshua. you are right there with emily.:::['4-20-71']
and it's kind of like it's a tie.:::['4-20-72']
i gotta get back to my dishes. i gotta get to work. oh, yeah.:::['4-20-73']
you know what would make me happy? oh, yeah, no, what's that?:::['4-20-74']
if the four of us could all, you know, hang out together.:::['4-20-75']
emily's coming into town this weekend. why don't, uh, we all have dinner sunday night?:::['4-20-76']
that would be great! yeah?:::['4-20-77']
all right. it's a date! right. yeah.:::['4-20-78']
"hang in there." you hang in there.:::['4-20-79']
did you say something? no, just singing.:::['4-20-80']
oh, look at this one! it's so beautiful. yeah. oof.:::['4-20-82']
about half of these will end up getting divorced.:::['4-20-83']
may i help you ladies?:::['4-20-84']
yes, um, i'm here to pick up a dress on hold. what's the name?:::['4-20-85']
emily waltham. oh, yes, i have it right here.:::['4-20-86']
would you like to try it on, miss waltham?:::['4-20-87']
you're the most beautiful bride i've ever seen.:::['4-20-89']
i am, aren't i?:::['4-20-90']
miss waltham?:::['4-20-91']
yes? we're closing.:::['4-20-92']
and could i get my ring back?:::['4-20-94']
all right, buddy. time to roll over.:::['4-20-95']
no, no! no, no, no, no, no!:::['4-20-96']
you are going to a clinic! you're going to a clinic!:::['4-20-97']
and a pajama store!:::['4-20-98']
does she use the cups? yes, i believe she does.:::['4-20-99']
does she use the plates? yes, i believe she does!:::['4-20-100']
thank you. heh.:::['4-20-102']
oh, thank you for coming.:::['4-20-105']
uh, just a second. phoebe: no, no! let me in!:::['4-20-106']
phoebe? phoebe: yeah?:::['4-20-107']
can you hold on a minute? phoebe: no!:::['4-20-108']
you have to let me in right now!:::['4-20-109']
are you alone? phoebe: yes!:::['4-20-110']
this sucks. i have to stay up all night before i go to the stupid clinic.:::['4-20-112']
i'm so tired.:::['4-20-113']
it's 6:00.:::['4-20-114']
i hear you and joshua are going out with ross and emily.:::['4-20-116']
and i think... i think that's really cool.:::['4-20-117']
yeah, i think you're handling that really well.:::['4-20-118']
"handling it"? what do you mean? there's nothing to handle.:::['4-20-119']
maybe i'd have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and joshua.:::['4-20-120']
they're not gonna get married anyway. what?:::['4-20-121']
come on. they rushed into this thing so fast, it's ridiculous!:::['4-20-122']
they'll be engaged for like what? a year?:::['4-20-123']
somewhere, one of them is gonna realize what they've done... ...and call the thing off.:::['4-20-124']
you'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.:::['4-20-125']
you know, i don't dance at weddings.:::['4-20-126']
why not? weddings are a great place to meet women.:::['4-20-127']
when i dance, i look like this.:::['4-20-128']
hey, man. hey.:::['4-20-129']
so, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?:::['4-20-130']
i am......free.:::['4-20-132']
great, because we're getting married in a month.:::['4-20-133']
what? yup.:::['4-20-134']
in a month? yeah.:::['4-20-135']
you mean 30 days? yeah.:::['4-20-136']
from now? yeah.:::['4-20-137']
that's great! yeah, ha, ha.:::['4-20-138']
emily always wanted to get married in this place her parents got married......but it's gonna be torn down, so...:::['4-20-139']
i know it's crazy, but everything's been so crazy......and it just feels right, you know?:::['4-20-140']
hey, that's the day after i start menstruating!:::['4-20-141']
this isn't mine.:::['4-20-142']
ahem hey, rachel. hi.:::['4-20-143']
joshua: what's up? oh, heh.:::['4-20-144']
your voice sounded all squeaky on the phone.:::['4-20-145']
oh, nothing. i just wanted to see you.:::['4-20-146']
see you and hug you.:::['4-20-147']
ha, ha. see you, heh. great. yeah!:::['4-20-148']
i'm more than okay. i am really, really happy.:::['4-20-151']
want to know why?:::['4-20-152']
do i?:::['4-20-153', '3-18-42']
because i am really happy about us.:::['4-20-154']
i think we are so on the right track.:::['4-20-155']
i think we are working. i think we are clicking.:::['4-20-156']
you know? yeah, sure, sure. we're... we're clicking. yeah.:::['4-20-157']
if there was just one little area... ...where i think we need to work on, i would think......it's that we're:::['4-20-158']
just not crazy enough.:::['4-20-159']
i got to say, i'm not too sure i agree with that.:::['4-20-160']
well, yeah. you know, yeah, you're right. i mean, we have our fun. yeah? but, uh...:::['4-20-161']
we ju... i mean, like crazy! you know?:::['4-20-162']
this is going to sound, you know, a little, um, hasty.:::['4-20-164']
but, uh, just go with me.:::['4-20-165']
what if we got married?:::['4-20-166']
aah? heh.:::['4-20-167']
what? oh, i know. it's so totally like::::['4-20-168']
"whoa, can we do this?" you know? i mean...:::['4-20-169']
but it just feels right. don't you think? it does.:::['4-20-170']
i mean, it just feels right. don't you...?:::['4-20-171']
rachel, um... ...you're... ...a real... ...special lady.:::['4-20-173']
but my divorce isn't final yet... ...and we've been on four dates.:::['4-20-174']
so i'm thinking no......but......thanks.:::['4-20-175']
your name, please? joey tribbiani.:::['4-20-177']
mm-hm. did you stay up all night in preparation for your study?:::['4-20-178']
uh, sir?:::['4-20-179']
yes, he did. all right. we'll call you in a few minutes.:::['4-20-180']
chandler: whoa. hey.:::['4-20-181']
check out that girl. she is really hot.:::['4-20-182']
yeah, she is.:::['4-20-183']
what? you're coming on to the entire room.:::['4-20-186']
i'm chandler. hi. i'm marjorie. hi.:::['4-20-187']
do you mind if i sit? no, please.:::['4-20-188']
so, uh, what are you in for? i talk in my sleep.:::['4-20-189']
what a coincidence. i listen in my sleep.:::['4-20-190']
joey: so why don't you give me your number?:::['4-20-191']
are you ready? okay. yeah.:::['4-20-192']
i got it! mine! aah!:::['4-20-193']
congratulations! thank you! ha-ha-ha.:::['4-20-194']
okay, my turn, my turn! okay!:::['4-20-195']
okay, ready?:::['4-20-196']
that was a terrible throw!:::['4-20-198']
i won't throw it right to you. that's not real.:::['4-20-199']
look at me. my big concern is what's real?:::['4-20-200']
oh, my god. we're really sad, aren't we?:::['4-20-201']
yeah, i think we are.:::['4-20-202']
this isn't even my dress.:::['4-20-203']
at least you didn't rent yours from a store called "it's not too late.":::['4-20-204']
i'm changing out of this. me too.:::['4-20-205']
in, like, a half an hour? me too.:::['4-20-206']
all right, now throw it straight this time. okay.:::['4-20-207']
i'm getting married next! yay!:::['4-20-208']
i hate my regular clothes now.:::['4-20-209']
you know? i look down and i know... ...this isn't gonna be the most special day of my life.:::['4-20-210']
yeah. i mean, it was kind of fun for a while......but didn't you feel kind of silly?:::['4-20-211']
oh, you're such a cheater!:::['4-20-214']
hello, little ones.:::['4-20-215']
so is joey going to stop snoring? yep!:::['4-20-217']
and a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me.:::['4-20-218']
joey wanted to ask her out, but, uh, you know, she picked me.:::['4-20-219']
how'd that happen?:::['4-20-220']
because i'm cooler.:::['4-20-221']
she's the kind of girl... joey was unconscious.:::['4-20-223']
hey, you guys! what's happening?:::['4-20-224']
monica: oh, my god.:::['4-20-225']
what is that? oh! they gave it to me at the sleep clinic. and it's going to help me not to snore.:::['4-20-226']
well, are you asleep right now, joe? you don't have to wear it unless you are.:::['4-20-227']
i know i don't have to.:::['4-20-228']
it tastes good.:::['4-20-229']
plus, you look cool.:::['4-20-230']
well, i just called joshua. oh, how'd it go?:::['4-20-231']
i did my best to convince him that i'm not... ...some crazy girl who is dying to get married.:::['4-20-232']
and i'm going through a hard time. what'd he say?:::['4-20-233']
well, uh, his answering machine was very understanding.:::['4-20-234']
i feel blue. ugh.:::['4-20-235']
phoebe: aw. monica: sweety.:::['4-20-236']
i bet you anything he'll call you again.:::['4-20-237']
yeah, maybe. but, you know, i don't think i even care.:::['4-20-238']
i don't think he's the one i'm sad about.:::['4-20-239']
i know i said i'm totally okay with ross getting married.:::['4-20-240']
but as it turns out... ...i don't think i'm handling it all that well.:::['4-20-241']
yeah, maybe.:::['4-20-242', '3-5-290']
and i'm just trying to figure out why. any luck?:::['4-20-243']
well, yeah. you know how ross and i have always been... ...on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again?:::['4-20-244']
i guess i just figured, somewhere down the road... ...we would be on-again.:::['4-20-245']
again.:::['4-20-246']
you know what? i think we all did.:::['4-20-247']
rachel: hey.:::['4-20-249']
ahem, hey. so.:::['4-20-250']
i got us reservations for sunday night. how about ernie's at 9:00?:::['4-20-251']
yeah, well, you, uh, better make it for three.:::['4-20-252']
see, i don't know if we're going to be hungry at 3:00.:::['4-20-253']
three people. joshua's not going to be there.:::['4-20-254']
what happened? um, well, i think he broke up with me.:::['4-20-255']
apparently, he scares easy.:::['4-20-257']
rachel, i'm sorry. eh, it's okay.:::['4-20-258']
sometimes things don't work out the way you thought they would.:::['4-20-259']
oh, hey, don't you have to go pick up emily? yeah. yeah.:::['4-20-261']
are you okay? yeah. i got my girls.:::['4-20-262']
hey, you know what might cheer you up? what?:::['4-20-265']
i got to tell you... ...this really does put me in a better mood.:::['4-20-266']
ah, i wish there was a job where i could wear this all the time.:::['4-20-267']
maybe someday there will be.:::['4-20-268']
oh, god, that's chandler coming by to borrow candles for his big date.:::['4-20-269']
no, rachel, don't get it! he'll see us!:::['4-20-270']
no, yeah! the groom cannot see the bride.:::['4-20-271']
i'm not going to marry chandler. not after this!:::['4-20-272']
okay guys, just relax.:::['4-20-273']
i do!:::['4-20-274']
i gotta go. wait, joshua!:::['4-20-275']
yeah, well, that ought to do it.:::['4-20-276']
food's here. fair enough.:::['4-20-277']
fifteen-minute warning.:::['4-20-278']
late.:::['4-20-279']
dude, i am trying to sleep!:::['4-20-280']
that eas the 10th time i've peed since i've been here.:::['4-22-0']
it's also, like, the 10th time you've told us. ha, ha.:::['4-22-1']
yeah, oh, i'm sorry, it must be hard to hear.:::['4-22-2']
i'll tell you, it's easier having babies playing... ..."bring in 'da noise, bring in 'da funk" on your bladder.:::['4-22-3']
i am so sick of being pregnant.:::['4-22-4']
the only happiness i get is from a cup of coffee... ...which of course is decaf because, oh, i'm pregnant. heh.:::['4-22-5']
pheebs, you want a cookie?:::['4-22-6']
so, uh, pheebs, honey, hoe are those mood seings coming?:::['4-22-8']
i haven't really had any yet.:::['4-22-9']
all right. here's the ring.:::['4-22-11']
yes, yes. a thousand times, yes.:::['4-22-12']
so, uh, any ideas for the bachelor party?:::['4-22-13']
before you start handing out rings and planning bachelor parties... ...don't you have to decide who your best man's gonna be?:::['4-22-15']
oh, it's awkward. it's aekward, it's awkeard.:::['4-22-16']
i sort of already asked chandler.:::['4-22-17']
what? he got to do it at your first eedding.:::['4-22-18']
joey, i figured you'd understand. i've known him a lot longer.:::['4-22-19']
come on, ross. i don't have any brothers. i'm never gonna get to be a best man.:::['4-22-20']
you can be the best man when i get married.:::['4-22-21']
i'm never gonna get to be a best man.:::['4-22-22']
so you get to be my best man twice, and i don't get to be yours at all?:::['4-22-24']
oh, no. yeah, of course, you can be my best man.:::['4-22-25']
what about me? you just said i could.:::['4-22-26']
i'm not even getting married!:::['4-22-27']
okay, this is a question for science-fiction eriters.:::['4-22-28']
i can't believe you're not picking me.:::['4-22-29']
hey, hoe could it not be me? i'm not even--:::['4-22-30']
i'm not even-- all right, you knoe ehat? that's it. from now on,joey i eant you to be my best man.:::['4-22-31']
yes. shame about you, though.:::['4-22-32']

one of the babies is kicking. i thought that was a good thing. it's not kicking me.:::['4-22-34']
it's kicking one of the other babies.:::['4-22-35']
oh. don't make me come in there!:::['4-22-36']

i wake up this morning, the stripper's gone, and the ring is gone!:::['4-22-141']
you slept with the stripper? of course!:::['4-22-142']
hi, guys.:::['4-22-143']
both: hi, phoebe.:::['4-22-144']
ahem. i wanted to apologize if i, you know, seemed a tad edgy yesterday... ...at my shower.:::['4-22-145']
you know, it's just the hormones. you know?:::['4-22-146']
no, we-- hormones. yeah. hormones.:::['4-22-147']
anyway, i just wanted to say thank you. it was just-- it eas so sweet. oh, okay. phoebe: so sweet.:::['4-22-148']
rachel: yeah. wow, you seem to be doing much better.:::['4-22-149']
that's great. how are things going? good.:::['4-22-150']
no, but-- okay, it feels like everything's been about me lately. so, ehat's happening with you?:::['4-22-151']
oh. well, actually, we eere just talking about me not going to ross' wedding.:::['4-22-152']
oh. it just might be too hard... ...given the history and all that.:::['4-22-153']
wow, this reminds me of the time when i was, um, living on the street.:::['4-22-154']
and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him.:::['4-22-155']
well, hoe is this like that?:::['4-22-156']
well, let's see. it's not really like that.:::['4-22-157']
because, you see, that eas an actual problem.:::['4-22-158']
and, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch of high-school crap... ...that nobody really gives-- yeah.:::['4-22-159']
well, i'm sorry. i just thought--:::['4-22-160']
all right, here come the waterworks.:::['4-22-161']
oh. i don't knoe ehat i'm gonna do. i called the company that sent her, and they don't care.:::['4-22-162']
and i called 91 1 and they yelled at me. if this isn't an emergency, then what is?:::['4-22-163']
i just wanted to thank you for last night. what a great party. and the guys from work had a blast.:::['4-22-165']
you know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.:::['4-22-166']
yeah, and another one had never been to a party before, so....:::['4-22-167']
so, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?:::['4-22-168']
man, that is nice. yeah. yeah, right?:::['4-22-169']
yeah, i was thinking i might pick one of those babies up for myself. where might one get one of those?:::['4-22-170']
that ring, when my grandmother first came to this country......that ring and the clothes on her back:::['4-22-171']
were all she had eith her.:::['4-22-172']
so you might say that the ring is irreplaceable.:::['4-22-173']
oh, absolutely. it's been in my family for generations.:::['4-22-174']
and every bride who's worn it has lived a long and happy life.:::['4-22-175']
so you might say it's a magic ring.:::['4-22-176']
yeah, the stripper stole it.:::['4-22-177']
my ring? my wedding ring? the stripper stole my wedding ring?:::['4-22-178']
hoe? hoe could this happen?:::['4-22-179']
well, i think it all started when you said, "hey, joey, why don't you be my best man.":::['4-22-180']
all right, all right. fine. i'm gonna call the cops.:::['4-22-181']
dude, i screeed up. you don't have to turn me in.:::['4-22-182']
not on you, on the stripper. oh, yeah, well, i already did that.:::['4-22-183']
they said they're gonna look into it right after they solve all the murders....:::['4-22-184']
okay, we'll call the company that sent her.:::['4-22-185']
i did that too. they wouldn't give me her name or number.:::['4-22-186']
they said if i bother them again, they'd call the police.:::['4-22-187']
i said, "you talk to the police, you tell them i'm missing a ring.":::['4-22-188']
so, ehat, joey? what are you telling me? that there's nothing ee can do?:::['4-22-189']
hoe could this happen? look, ross, i am so, so sorry.:::['4-22-190']
well, what if we just, uh, called her... ...used a fake name and had her come to my office?:::['4-22-191']
oh, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!:::['4-22-192']
here's your tea, phoebe.:::['4-22-193']
mm. it's so good.:::['4-22-194']
oh, thanks. that's sweet.:::['4-22-195']
good. so glad you like it.:::['4-22-196']
oh. both: what? what? she made the tea.:::['4-22-197']
no, i think i just had a contraction.:::['4-22-198']
you what? my god.:::['4-22-199']
yeah, i thought i felt one a couple minutes ago.:::['4-22-200']
and now i know that definitely was one. well, you can't have the baby here! i haven't sterilized the apartment since the guys moved out!:::['4-22-201']
it's okay. we're gonna be okay. you know what? it's okay. i'm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets.:::['4-22-202']
oe, it's all right. it's probably false labor.:::['4-22-203']
they said that, that can happen near the end. so just--:::['4-22-204']
somebody get the book. rachel, get the book. the book. okay. okay. here.:::['4-22-205']
the bible? i don't know!:::['4-22-206']
all right. okay, okay. this is great.:::['4-22-207']
uh, chandler, you get behind the desk.:::['4-22-208']
and when she comes in, hopefully she won't recognize you because-- well, why would she?:::['4-22-209']
uh, okay. and then you buzz ross and i.:::['4-22-210']
you be mr. gonzales, and i'll be mr. wong.:::['4-22-211']

chicken kiev? ross: mm-hm.:::['4-23-78']
doesn't that sound delicious at the last minute?:::['4-23-79']
i know, but something like salmon would just...:::['4-23-80']
it would be so much more elegant than chicken.:::['4-23-81']
and you wouldn't have to worry about the salmonella.:::['4-23-82']
i can't wait to see where you're getting married.:::['4-23-84']
yes. this place is beautiful. emily's parents got married here.:::['4-23-85']
i still can't believe they're tearing it down.:::['4-23-86']
it really is the most lovely building you'll ever see.:::['4-23-87']
i mean, it's over...:::['4-23-88']
it's nice.:::['4-23-90']
oh. oh, my god.:::['4-23-91']
how can this be happening? what are we gonna do?:::['4-23-92']
everything's gonna be all right.:::['4-23-93', '3-23-347']
how is it gonna be all right? uh-huh, i see that.:::['4-23-94']
okay, i talked to the guy and found out what happened.:::['4-23-95']
ross & emily: what? they tore it down a few days early.:::['4-23-96']
joey: all right.:::['4-23-97', '3-14-117']
westminster abbey.:::['4-23-98']
hands down, best abbey i ever seen.:::['4-23-99']
what do you think of the abbey, chandler?:::['4-23-102']
oh, i think it's great. they're thinking of changing the name.:::['4-23-103']
really? to what? to "put the camera away.":::['4-23-104']
man, you are westminster crabby.:::['4-23-105']
honey, don't get up. what do you need? oh, no. oh, nothing.:::['4-23-106']
come on. i'm here to take care of you. what do you need? anything.:::['4-23-107']
okay, i have a wedgie.:::['4-23-108']
okay, that is all you.:::['4-23-109']
so, what do you want for lunch?:::['4-23-110']
i guess we have to eat. yeah, i do.:::['4-23-112']
i'm just bummed the way i left things with ross.:::['4-23-114']
i wish i didn't lie to him about having to work.:::['4-23-115']
he seemed so mad at me.:::['4-23-116']
ah, don't be so hard on yourself. if someone i was still in love with was...:::['4-23-117']
still in love with? yeah.:::['4-23-118']
i'm not in love with ross.:::['4-23-119']
no, no. good.:::['4-23-121']
phoebe, i'm not going to ross' wedding, because he's my ex-boyfriend......and that would be:::['4-23-123']
really uncomfortable.:::['4-23-124']
not because i'm still in love with him. hey, i like ross as much as the next guy.:::['4-23-125']
you know, clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love.:::['4-23-126']
you know, i mean, do i still have loving feelings for ross?:::['4-23-127']
i have continuing feelings of love.:::['4-23-129']
but that doesn't mean that i'm still in love with him.:::['4-23-130']
you know, i mean, i have sexual feelings for him, but i do love him.:::['4-23-131']
oh, my god. oh, my...:::['4-23-132']
we thought you knew. we?:::['4-23-134']
yeah, we all know. we talk about it all the time.:::['4-23-135']
you all know? does ross know?:::['4-23-136']
oh, no. ross doesn't know anything.:::['4-23-137']
oh. i cannot believe you didn't tell me.:::['4-23-138']
because we thought you knew. it's so obvious.:::['4-23-139']
god, it would be like, you know, telling monica::::['4-23-140']
"hey," you know, "you like things clean.":::['4-23-141']
so, what are you fine gentlemen in the market for?:::['4-23-143']
we've got scarves, souvenir postcards. check this out, huh?:::['4-23-144']
that's the stuff. what do you think?:::['4-23-146']
well, i'm not gonna have to buy that "i'm with stupid" t-shirt anymore.:::['4-23-147']
well, i like it. here you go.:::['4-23-148']
you're not really gonna buy that. don't you think you've embarrassed me enough?:::['4-23-149']
oh, i embarrass you?:::['4-23-150']
how can i answer that when i'm pretending i don't know you?:::['4-23-151']
he's just jealous. you'll fit right in. all londoners wear them.:::['4-23-152']
oh, really? then how come no one here anywhere is wearing one?:::['4-23-153']
they're all tourists.:::['4-23-154']
all right, look, if you insist on wearing that in public, you know......you're gonna spend the rest:::['4-23-155']
of the afternoon all by yourself.:::['4-23-156']
joey: oh, yeah?:::['4-23-157']
if you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat, i choose the hat.:::['4-23-158']
good choice. thanks.:::['4-23-159']
okay, look. all right, that's it, okay?:::['4-23-160']
i'm out of here. i'm not gonna be embarrassed anymore.:::['4-23-161']
hello? hey.:::['4-23-162']
i just spoke to your dad, and you know what?:::['4-23-163']
he thinks we'll be able to find a new place.:::['4-23-164']
we don't have to. what, you found a place?:::['4-23-165']
no, but monica and i were talking......and i was so upset about the hall:::['4-23-166']
being knocked down......and she suggested:::['4-23-167']
that we just put the wedding off for a bit.:::['4-23-168']
she said what? she said if i'm not happy......getting married somewhere we can find:::['4-23-169']
in a day, well, we should just postpone it.:::['4-23-170']
postpone it? heh.:::['4-23-171']
emily, do you think monica realizes how much our parents spent on this wedding?:::['4-23-172']
huh? do you think my sister's teeny, tiny little brain comprehends......that people took time:::['4-23-173']
out of their lives......to fly thousands of miles:::['4-23-174']
to be here? huh?:::['4-23-175']
this isn't right.:::['4-23-176']
i realize that people are gonna be disappointed.:::['4-23-177']
but they'll come back when we can do it right.:::['4-23-178']
well, i can't ask people to do that. would you ask people to do that?:::['4-23-179']
don't you point your pants at me.:::['4-23-180']
we have no choice.:::['4-23-181']
anywhere that's half-decent will have been booked months ago.:::['4-23-182']
ross, don't you understand? this is our wedding.:::['4-23-183']
the only thing i understand is postponing it is not an option.:::['4-23-184']
this is when we're getting married.:::['4-23-185']
what are you saying, it's now or never? no, i'm saying it's now.:::['4-23-186']
or? there's no "or" in mine.:::['4-23-187']
what is wrong with these pants?:::['4-23-188']
it's not the pants. it's you who's backwards.:::['4-23-189']
and if you don't understand how important this is to me......perhaps we shouldn't:::['4-23-190']
be getting married at all.:::['4-23-191']
emily, no. wait, stop. emily, please...:::['4-23-192']
so did shopping help you feel any better about ross?:::['4-23-194']
manhattan does not have enough stores.:::['4-23-195']
well, i think i can help you get over him.:::['4-23-196']
you can? yeah.:::['4-23-197']
i just need you to bring me some photos of ross......and, um, a small piece of chocolate......and a glass of tepid water.:::['4-23-198']
ooh. is this one of those things where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt......and hang it from a north-facing tree?:::['4-23-199']
uh, only if you have the hiccups too.:::['4-23-200']
the pictures are for you. the chocolate and water's for me.:::['4-23-201']
i just didn't feel like getting up.:::['4-23-202']
okay. i'm gonna show you a picture of ross, okay......and you're going to remember:::['4-23-203']
all the bad things about him, all right?:::['4-23-204']
really focus on his flaws. i can do that.:::['4-23-205']
certainly did that while we were going out. heh.:::['4-23-206']
okay. mm.:::['4-23-207']
before we get started, i just wanna say, for the record, i love ross.:::['4-23-208']
i think he's such a great guy.:::['4-23-209']
okay. now close your eyes.:::['4-23-210']
and imagine that you're with ross. mm-hm.:::['4-23-211']
okay, and imagine that you're kissing him. mm-hm.:::['4-23-212']
you're running your hands all over his body.:::['4-23-213']
and then you run your hands through his hair......but, oh, ew, gross,it's some kind of grease, it's... ugh.:::['4-23-214']
ah?:::['4-23-215']
i don't know, his hair never bothered me that much.:::['4-23-217']
and you know, it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.:::['4-23-218']
okay. this is gonna be harder than i thought.:::['4-23-219']
um, ahem. let's try some aversion therapy.:::['4-23-220']
okay. all right. okay? all right.:::['4-23-221']
look at the picture. okay.:::['4-23-222']
all right, and, um...:::['4-23-223']
okay. how do you feel now? well, i like you less.:::['4-23-225']
oh. sorry. no, no, you know what? i'm sorry.:::['4-23-227']
i shouldn't have said you were embarrassing me.:::['4-23-228']
that really wasn't cool.:::['4-23-229']
and if it makes you feel any better, i've had a really lousy day.:::['4-23-230']
yeah? no!:::['4-23-232']
i had the best day ever.:::['4-23-233']
dude, check this out.:::['4-23-234']
say hi to my friend and tell him you like my hat.:::['4-23-236']
okay, so, what's your friend's name? oh. chandler.:::['4-23-237']
that's... that's...:::['4-23-239']
oh, my god. that's fergie, baby!:::['4-23-240']
joey says you don't really like his hat, but i think it's kind of dashing.:::['4-23-241']
when did you...? how...?:::['4-23-242']
i was trying to figure out how to get to buckingham palace.:::['4-23-243']
so i'm in my map and...:::['4-23-244']
i understand you had a little talk with emily.:::['4-23-247']
ha, ha. yes, i did.:::['4-23-248']
and you are welcome.:::['4-23-249']
am i?:::['4-23-250']
and was it your idea to postpone the wedding?:::['4-23-251']
i'm gonna go to the bathroom. wait up.:::['4-23-253']
hey, hey, since you're the fix-it lady, here's a pickle::::['4-23-254']
what do you do when the bride says she doesn't wanna have the wedding at all?:::['4-23-255']
she said that? yeah.:::['4-23-256']
i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone......and she, like, flipped out.:::['4-23-258']
oh, my god. you're even dumber than i am.:::['4-23-259']
ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?:::['4-23-261']
i don't know. a month?:::['4-23-262']
emily has probably been planning it since she was 5.:::['4-23-263']
ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off her head.:::['4-23-264']
that's what we did.:::['4-23-265']
we dreamed about the perfect wedding.:::['4-23-266']
in the perfect place.:::['4-23-267']
with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake.:::['4-23-268']
with the little people on top.:::['4-23-269']
but the most important part......is that we had the perfect guy......who understood just how important:::['4-23-270']
all that other stuff was.:::['4-23-271']
i had no idea.:::['4-23-272']
that pillowcase thing, i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.:::['4-23-273']
sometimes we were.:::['4-23-274']
you gotta help me figure out what to do.:::['4-23-276']
okay? all right.:::['4-23-277']
whoa. pretty intense, huh? yeah.:::['4-23-279']
i hope ross didn't think we went in there because we were uncomfortable out here.:::['4-23-280']
i hope he did.:::['4-23-281']
hello? hey, pheebs, it's joey.:::['4-23-282']
hey, joey. hey. ooh, ooh.:::['4-23-283']
i just saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.:::['4-23-284']
i was gonna go over and say hi, but then i figured he doesn't care he looks like you.:::['4-23-285']
that just cost me 4 bucks.:::['4-23-286']
i just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing.:::['4-23-287']
they're having a great time with aunt phoebe.:::['4-23-288']
aunt rachel hasn't been helpful at all.:::['4-23-289']
so do you miss me?:::['4-23-290']
kind of, but i've just been having way too much fun.:::['4-23-291']
oh, so you're not homesick yet?:::['4-23-292']
no, i don't think so.:::['4-23-293']
all right, well, the seven of us miss you.:::['4-23-294']
who's seven? well, you know, me, rachel......the birds, the babies.:::['4-23-295']
aw, the babies miss me?:::['4-23-296']
ooh, pizza guy's here. what? you ordered pizza without me?:::['4-23-297']
yeah, but we were thinking about you. we ordered the joey special.:::['4-23-298']
two pizzas?:::['4-23-299']
yeah. okay, gotta go. talk to you later. wait, wait. where did you get it from?:::['4-23-300']
where everybody knows your name:::['4-23-301']
and they're always glad you came:::['4-23-302']
you wanna be where you can see the troubles are all the same:::['4-23-303']
you wanna be where everybody knows your name:::['4-23-304']
monica, why have you brought me here? you'll see.:::['4-23-305']
i tell you, this wedding is not gonna happen.:::['4-23-306']
okay? but imagine a lot more lights, okay, and, you know, fewer bricks......and flowers and candles.:::['4-23-308']
monica: okay, and the musicians, they can go over here, okay?:::['4-23-309']
and the chairs, they can face this way and...:::['4-23-310']
but if you don't love this, then we'll do it any other place......any other time.:::['4-23-312']
really, it's fine. whatever you want.:::['4-23-313']
and, i don't know, if it starts to rain... well, then we'll get wet.:::['4-23-315']
i don't even have a date.:::['4-23-317']
rachel: pheebs? yeah?:::['4-23-318']
rachel: do you remember where the duck food is?:::['4-23-319']
yeah, it's in the guys' apartment, under the sink. why?:::['4-23-320']
because i'm going to london.:::['4-23-321']
what? what do you mean, you're going to london?:::['4-23-322']
yeah, i have to tell ross that i love him.:::['4-23-323']
now, honey, you take care, and you don't have those babies till i get back. mwah.:::['4-23-324']
rachel, you can't go. ross loves emily.:::['4-23-325']
i know, i know, i know he does, but i have to tell him how i feel.:::['4-23-326']
he deserves to have all of the information. then he can make an informed decision.:::['4-23-327']
that's not why you're going. you're going because you hope he'll say::::['4-23-328']
"yeah, i love you too, rach. forget about that british chippie.":::['4-23-329']
do you think he will?:::['4-23-330']
no, because he's in love with the british chippie.:::['4-23-331']
look, rachel, if you go, you're just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding.:::['4-23-332']
you know? it's too late. you missed your chance.:::['4-23-333']
i'm sorry. i know this must be really hard.:::['4-23-334']
but it's over.:::['4-23-335']
you know what? no. it's not over until someone says "i do.":::['4-23-336']
i do. i do! i do!:::['4-23-337']
yeah, like i can really chase you. i'm carrying a litter.:::['4-23-338']
i just saw kathy naked.:::['4-7-0']
it was like torture.:::['4-7-1']
if we go to war and you're captured, you're in for a surprise.:::['4-7-2']
it keeps getting worse.:::['4-7-3']
i'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend.:::['4-7-4']
every time we're in the same room, there's weird energy between us.:::['4-7-5']
call me crazy, but i think she likes me too.:::['4-7-6']
and now i have seen her naked.:::['4-7-7']
at least with her clothes on... ...i could imagine her body was covered in boils.:::['4-7-8']
but there are no boils. she's smooth.:::['4-7-9']
smooth!:::['4-7-10']
wow...:::['4-7-11']
could you see up his robe?:::['4-7-12']
monica: oh, my god. group: yeah.:::['4-7-13']
here you go. i'll call you.:::['4-7-14']
hey, hey. who was that?:::['4-7-16']
casey. we're going out tonight.:::['4-7-17']
going out? wow.:::['4-7-18']
it didn't work out with kathy? bummer.:::['4-7-19']
no, things are fine.:::['4-7-20']
i'm having a late meal with her after an early one with casey.:::['4-7-21']
what? joey: yeah. the craziest thing is, i just ate a whole pizza myself.:::['4-7-22']
chandler:wait... you're going out with kathy. yeah.:::['4-7-23']
why are you upset?:::['4-7-24']
well, i'm upset......for you.:::['4-7-25']
sex with an endless line of women must be unfulfilling.:::['4-7-26']
what's the big deal? it's not like we're exclusive.:::['4-7-27']
look, joey.:::['4-7-28']
kathy's not fulfilling your emotional needs.:::['4-7-29']
but casey...:::['4-7-30']
granted, i just saw the back of her head.:::['4-7-31']
but i got this sense that she's smart and funny......and gets you.:::['4-7-32']
you got all that from the back of her head?:::['4-7-33']
it's time to settle down.:::['4-7-34']
make a choice. pick a lane.:::['4-7-35']
who's elaine?:::['4-7-36']
little tony tarzan:::['4-7-37']
swinging on a nose hair swinging with the greatest of ease:::['4-7-38']
i don't know the next verse.:::['4-7-39']
you could just go: greatest of ease:::['4-7-40']
ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma...:::['4-7-41']
then go right into it.:::['4-7-42']
how do you know about "ba-ma-na-ma-na-ma"?:::['4-7-44']
you know, i used to play.:::['4-7-45']
that's right. the keyboards?:::['4-7-46']
a little in high school. i got into it in college.:::['4-7-47']
that's when i really found my sound.:::['4-7-48']
juice just came out of my nose, but it was worth it.:::['4-7-49']
oh, my god. i completely forgot about your sound. yeah.:::['4-7-50']
he'd lock himself in the basement.:::['4-7-51']
no one was ever allowed to hear "the sound.":::['4-7-52']
i want to hear "the sound.":::['4-7-53']
no, i mean, i haven't played in so long.:::['4-7-54']
well, it's really personal stuff.:::['4-7-55']
play that funky music, white boy.:::['4-7-56']
monica: yeah, come on. no, you guys. my keyboards are all the way... yeah, okay.:::['4-7-57']
okay, guys.:::['4-7-58']
all right. bring it on, you.:::['4-7-59']
you know, i've never played my stuff for anyone before.:::['4-7-61']
it's important that you understand... ...it's about communicating......very private emotions.:::['4-7-62']
you know... you should think of my work......as wordless sound poems.:::['4-7-63']
that's what... my god, play.:::['4-7-64']
well, you know, that was......terrific.:::['4-7-65']
really... ...bitchin'.:::['4-7-66']
wow. it was so wow.:::['4-7-67']
yeah. i mean, you should play in public.:::['4-7-69']
wow, thanks, you guys. that's...:::['4-7-70']
i want to play you another piece.:::['4-7-71']
ross: oh. i left my helicopter sounds on another disk. i'll be back.:::['4-7-72']
this is so nice. i mean, i am so...:::['4-7-73']
god bless my dad for soundproofing the basement.:::['4-7-74']
i can't believe i ever let him touch me with those fingers.:::['4-7-75']
what are you guys talking about? i loved it.:::['4-7-76']
it was so moving.:::['4-7-77']
it's so different from the stuff you usually hear.:::['4-7-78']
you mean, music?:::['4-7-79']
i know what you think.:::['4-7-80']
yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.:::['4-7-81']
come in.:::['4-7-82']
oh, god. is that baywatch?:::['4-7-84']
yes, but i just watch it for the articles.:::['4-7-85']
so is joey around?:::['4-7-86']
no, he's not back yet.:::['4-7-87']
come in, have a seat. bow or stern?:::['4-7-88']
i don't have a preference. you?:::['4-7-89']
i like it in the stern.:::['4-7-90']
of the boat.:::['4-7-91']
it's me. casey and i had a little car trouble.:::['4-7-93']
what happened? joey: we broke down.:::['4-7-94']
i have to get transmission fluid.:::['4-7-95']
tell kathy that i'm sorry and i'll be there soon.:::['4-7-96']
why can't you tell her? joey: i think my time is about to...:::['4-7-97']
joey? joey?:::['4-7-98']
i thought your time ran out.:::['4-7-100']
me too, but i guess i do have...:::['4-7-101']
joey's running a little late, and he says he's sorry.:::['4-7-102']
i guess it's just you and me, then.:::['4-7-103']
okay. yeah, i think it is.:::['4-7-105']
so what'd you do today?:::['4-7-106']
i had an appointment to cut my hair.:::['4-7-107']
looks great. and then it got canceled.:::['4-7-108']
i could cut it.:::['4-7-109']
yeah, i learned at my aunt's dog-grooming shop. what do you say?:::['4-7-111']
dog grooming?:::['4-7-112']
don't make my tail too poofy.:::['4-7-113']
you have really great hair.:::['4-7-114']
oh, thanks. i grow it myself.:::['4-7-115']
joey also has great hair.:::['4-7-116']

i got the fluid. the transmission wasn't there.:::['4-7-126']
what? joey: it fell out.:::['4-7-127']
i just figured we hit a dog.:::['4-7-128']
okay. joey: could you put kathy on? i want to apologize to her.:::['4-7-129']
it's joey.:::['4-7-130']
no, it's fine. don't worry about it.:::['4-7-132']
yeah, no, stop apologizing. it's okay.:::['4-7-133']
i'll talk to you tomorrow.:::['4-7-134']
i should probably go. yeah.:::['4-7-135']
yes. yeah...:::['4-7-136']
i forgot my purse.:::['4-7-137']
i really did. i forgot my purse.:::['4-7-139']
this is bad. it's bad. horrible.:::['4-7-140']
wait, the kiss or the situation?:::['4-7-141']
the kiss was good.:::['4-7-142']
but that's bad. here's what we do.:::['4-7-143']
we forget it. what?:::['4-7-144']
we swallow our feelings, even if we're unhappy forever. sound good?:::['4-7-145']
can you really do that?:::['4-7-146']
i have to. he's my best friend.:::['4-7-147']
and you're seeing him.:::['4-7-148']
chandler, i like joey a lot.:::['4-7-149']
but with you...:::['4-7-150']
no, don't. don't, see?:::['4-7-151']
you're getting me confused. i'm starting to yearn.:::['4-7-152']
if you want to pretend that nothing happened, i can try.:::['4-7-154']
i think we have to.:::['4-7-155']
are you still out there?:::['4-7-158']
kathy: no.:::['4-7-159']
electrifying:::['4-7-160']
infinite time:::['4-7-161']
there's a starbucks about three blocks down.:::['4-7-162']
he's so inspired. just look at him. look at him go.:::['4-7-163']
monica: hey, aren't you up next?:::['4-7-165']
i'm not playing tonight. why not?:::['4-7-166']
i can't follow ross.:::['4-7-167']
it'd be like those poor bicycle-riding chimps... ...who had to follow the beatles. no.:::['4-7-168']
phoebe. ross sucks.:::['4-7-169']
the place has emptied because of him.:::['4-7-170']
my god, he's not even appreciated in his own time.:::['4-7-171']
i'd give anything to not be appreciated in my own time.:::['4-7-172']
okay. phoebe...:::['4-7-173']
you suck too.:::['4-7-174', '4-7-177']
yeah, phoebe. you're awful.:::['4-7-175']
man. i can't believe i locked myself out again.:::['4-7-178']
hang on, buddy.:::['4-7-179']
my god. what happened?:::['4-7-180']
did you do all this? why? chandler: i sure did.:::['4-7-181']
it made me feel good to do something nice for my friend.:::['4-7-182']
you're amazing.:::['4-7-183']
no, this is amazing.:::['4-7-184']
a tv appears from nowhere.:::['4-7-185']
the dream.:::['4-7-186']
how did you afford all this?:::['4-7-187']
i'm 29. i mean, who needs a savings account?:::['4-7-188']
you're the best friend anyone has ever had.:::['4-7-189']
joey: no, you are. you do this, you give me advice...:::['4-7-191']
what you said about focusing on one woman?:::['4-7-192']
i'll do that.:::['4-7-193']
with casey?:::['4-7-194']
i'll see how things go with kathy. she's cool.:::['4-7-195']
or casey. joey: no, kathy.:::['4-7-196']
could be casey.:::['4-7-197']
no, kathy.:::['4-7-198']
consider casey.:::['4-7-199']
i think somebody's got a little crush on casey.:::['4-7-200']
i'll fix you two up. what do you think?:::['4-7-201']
that all the pieces of my life are falling right into place.:::['4-7-202']
you were really great. you were really, really great.:::['4-7-204']
monica tells me you don't want to play anymore because of me......and, you know, my talent.:::['4-7-206']
is that true?:::['4-7-207']
well, kind of, yeah. pheebs...:::['4-7-208']
i was trying to be really okay and upbeat about it......but i just feel so dwarfed:::['4-7-209']
by your musical gift.:::['4-7-210']
see, but...:::['4-7-211']
pheebs, that is the exact opposite intent of my music.:::['4-7-212']
you know, my music is meant to inspire.:::['4-7-213']
if it bothers you this much......then i won't play anymore.:::['4-7-214']
no, don't do that.:::['4-7-215']
how could i live if i knew i was depriving the world of your music?:::['4-7-216']
ross: hey, chandler. saw the new furniture. very nice.:::['4-7-218']
joey has the best boyfriend ever.:::['4-7-219']
i kissed kathy.:::['4-7-220']
group: what? are you serious?:::['4-7-221']
does joey know? chandler: no.:::['4-7-222']
is there any way you think he will understand this?:::['4-7-223']
you obviously haven't screwed over your friends.:::['4-7-224']
which we all appreciate.:::['4-7-225']
if you'd told him how you felt before you kissed her......knowing joey,he'd have stepped aside.:::['4-7-226']
don't say that. that's not true, is it?:::['4-7-227']
group: yeah. monica: he loves you.:::['4-7-228']
then why didn't you tell me to do that?:::['4-7-229']
i said something to phoebe.:::['4-7-230']
and i thought it was a really good idea.:::['4-7-231']
group: yeah, i remember. chandler: oh, my god.:::['4-7-232']
what am i going to do?:::['4-7-233']
you'll have to tell him.:::['4-7-234']
because you do. yeah, i know.:::['4-7-236']
would it be okay if i wrote a song about this?:::['4-7-237']
sambuca margarita?:::['4-7-239']
it that a real thing?:::['4-7-240']
well, we only had sambuca, so it is now.:::['4-7-241']
listen, joe. i need to... i need to talk to you.:::['4-7-242']
it's about kathy.:::['4-7-244']
i like her. i like her a lot, actually.:::['4-7-245']
you do? yeah.:::['4-7-246', '4-5-204']
your timing couldn't be better. she's not my girlfriend anymore.:::['4-7-247']
yeah, she broke up with me. when?:::['4-7-249']
just now, after acting class.:::['4-7-250']
i thought she was doing some scene, so i let people watch.:::['4-7-251']
man, i am so sorry. are you okay?:::['4-7-252']
i've been better, but i'm all right. so you like her?:::['4-7-253']
yes, but i don't have to.:::['4-7-254']
no, it's okay.:::['4-7-255']
yeah? joey: yeah.:::['4-7-256']
you know why? because you came to me first.:::['4-7-257']
i thought that would be the best thing to do.:::['4-7-258']
you might have your work cut out for you.:::['4-7-259']
when i talked to her, i got the feeling she's into some other guy.:::['4-7-260']
see, that's actually what i wanted to talk to you about.:::['4-7-261']
i think i know who the other guy is.:::['4-7-262']
it's me. i'm the other guy.:::['4-7-264']
when you were late last night, kathy and i got to talking......and one thing led to another, and...:::['4-7-266']
no, i just kissed her.:::['4-7-268']
what? that's even worse.:::['4-7-269']
how is that worse? it's the same.:::['4-7-270']
there's nothing i could do. i'm in love with her.:::['4-7-271']
joey: who cares?:::['4-7-272']
you went behind my back? i'd never do that to you.:::['4-7-273']
i have no excuses. i was totally over the line.:::['4-7-274']
you're so far past the line, that you can't even see the line.:::['4-7-275']
it's a dot to you.:::['4-7-276']
yes. yes, right. and i feel horrible. you have to believe me.:::['4-7-277']
is that why you bought all this?:::['4-7-278']
joey: i will not watch your tv. i won't listen to your stereo.:::['4-7-280']
and there's a loaf in the new bread maker i won't eat. know why?:::['4-7-281']
because... it's all tainted with your betrayal.:::['4-7-282']
this apartment is empty to me. i'm not happy about you, either.:::['4-7-283']
and just so you know......i made that bread for you.:::['4-7-284']
oh, my god. he's totally lost it.:::['4-7-285']
phoebe. this cannot get any worse.:::['4-7-287']
rats in the basement are hanging themselves.:::['4-7-288']
thank you. thanks.:::['4-7-289']
i won't play anymore.:::['4-7-291']
would you... can you finish my set?:::['4-7-292']
after that? yeah.:::['4-7-293']
no, i mean, if i can help.:::['4-7-294']
like i could lose it.:::['4-7-295']
what? i played bad on purpose, guys.:::['4-7-296']
you were playing bad this whole time.:::['4-7-298']
just that last song.:::['4-7-299']
thanks for the tasty dinner. you're welcome for a tasty dinner.:::['4-6-0']
phoebe: what are you guys looking at?:::['4-6-1']
chandler: ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.:::['4-6-2']
yeah, come to papa!:::['4-6-3']
probably the only time i'll say this......but did you see the ass on her?:::['4-6-5']
what did you? when did you?:::['4-6-6']
how did you? how did you get a girl like that?:::['4-6-7']
so what is she, like a spokesmodel? an aerobics instructor?:::['4-6-8']
actually, she's a paleontology doctoral candidate... ...specializing in the cenozoic era.:::['4-6-9']
but that's, like, the easiest era.:::['4-6-10']
i've seen her at work, but i always figured...:::['4-6-11']
but, uh, i made her dinner.:::['4-6-12']
we had a great time. and we're going out again tomorrow.:::['4-6-13']
maybe her friends are betting to see who gets the biggest geek.:::['4-6-14']
fine by me. hope she wins.:::['4-6-15']
you have any wrapping paper?:::['4-6-17']
is it for my birthday present?:::['4-6-18']
it was your birthday months ago.:::['4-6-19']
you said you ordered something special and it just hadn't come yet.:::['4-6-20']
i have a call in about that.:::['4-6-21']
it's for kathy. it's an early copy of her favorite book.:::['4-6-23']
oh! the velveteen rabbit!:::['4-6-24']
when the boy's love makes the rabbit real...:::['4-6-25']
don't touch it, because your fingers have destructive oils.:::['4-6-26']
then you'd better keep it away from ross' hair.:::['4-6-27']
this is pretty rare. how did you get that?:::['4-6-28']
no big deal. i just went to some bookstores......talked to some dealers, called:::['4-6-29']
some of the author's grandchildren.:::['4-6-30']
honey, that's so sweet.:::['4-6-31']
what a great way to say, "i secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend.":::['4-6-32']
it doesn't say that. does it?:::['4-6-33']
how will it look when you get her something incredibly meaningful......and expensive, and her boyfriend,joey, gives her an orange?:::['4-6-34']
i'll make sure joey gets her something really great.:::['4-6-35']
it's got to be better than that book.:::['4-6-36']
ooh! like a crossbow!:::['4-6-37']
once again, i am sorry.:::['4-6-38']
thank you. bye.:::['4-6-39']
i had to turn down a job catering a funeral for 60 people.:::['4-6-40']
oh, my god! what happened?:::['4-6-41']
sixty guests.:::['4-6-42']
why'd you have to turn it down?:::['4-6-43']
i don't have the money or equipment... ...to handle something that big on such short notice.:::['4-6-44']
wow, what is with all the negativity?:::['4-6-45']
you sound like "moni-can't," not "moni-can"!:::['4-6-46']
moni-ca.:::['4-6-47']
you've been playing around with this catering for years.:::['4-6-48']
do you want to be a caterer? i don't know.:::['4-6-49']
there you go! that's the spirit!:::['4-6-50']
if you need money, i will lend you money. just get moving!:::['4-6-51']
really? i'd need $500 for all the food and supplies.:::['4-6-52']
it's worth it if it'll get you moving. you haven't worked in months!:::['4-6-53']
neither have you.:::['4-6-54']
yes, but i'm doing this.:::['4-6-55']
that would be great! thank you.:::['4-6-56']
hey! chandler & kathy: hey!:::['4-6-57']
can i borrow your apartment keys?:::['4-6-58']
you can pee here.:::['4-6-60']
ha-ha-ha. yes, i can, of course. excuse me.:::['4-6-61']
it's okay. the duck's using our bathroom anyway.:::['4-6-62']
what are you getting for her birthday?:::['4-6-63']
we've been dating a couple weeks. i got to get her something?:::['4-6-64']
all: yes!:::['4-6-65']
yes! you have to get her something really nice.:::['4-6-66']
i know! and not one of your coupons... ...for an hour of "joey love.":::['4-6-67']
ooh! a crossword! can i help? no!:::['4-6-68']
last week i got all but three answers......and i want to finish one:::['4-6-69']
without any help.:::['4-6-70']
but you can't help me develop my new universal language.:::['4-6-72']
hey! how'd it go?:::['4-6-73']
oh, my god! it was the best funeral ever!:::['4-6-74']
everyone loved the food.:::['4-6-75']
i even got another funeral for tomorrow.:::['4-6-76']
the dead guy from today's best friend.:::['4-6-77']
it's like i am the official caterer for that accident.:::['4-6-78']
mon, i'm so happy for you!:::['4-6-79']
thanks. check out my new catering stuff.:::['4-6-80']
look! i'm an omelet station!:::['4-6-81']
omelet? made to order? ha!:::['4-6-82']
i'll have one, please. plus my money.:::['4-6-83']
i didn't realize you needed it right away.:::['4-6-85']
you told me to go and be a caterer. so i went. i be'd.:::['4-6-86']
i used it to buy all this stuff.:::['4-6-87']
i got another job tomorrow, so i'll pay you back then.:::['4-6-88']
oh! okay. sorry i acted like a bank.:::['4-6-89']
um, would you like to come in?:::['4-6-90']
did homo erectus hunt with wooden tools?:::['4-6-91']
according to recent findings.:::['4-6-92']
here, mitzi! here, mitzi!:::['4-6-93']
uh, mitzi is? my hamster.:::['4-6-94']
i hope she's okay. i haven't seen her in a while.:::['4-6-95']
uh, oh! do you, uh...?:::['4-6-98']
do you have any, um, cinnamon fruit toasties?:::['4-6-99']
what? well, i do.:::['4-6-100']
let's go back to my place, light a couple candles......break open a box:::['4-6-101']
of cinnamon fruit toasties?:::['4-6-102']
i'd rather not. oh, yeah? why not?:::['4-6-103']
okay, um... don't take this the wrong way......but your place kind of:::['4-6-104']
has a weird smell.:::['4-6-105']
is everything in the car? did you settle the bill?:::['4-6-106']
no. i hate this part.:::['4-6-107']
ooh! oh! look what we almost left!:::['4-6-108']
that's not mine. oh.:::['4-6-109']
ooh. look what we almost took!:::['4-6-110']
excuse me, ms. burkart?:::['4-6-111']
well, we're all cleaned up.:::['4-6-112']
oh. good. thank you.:::['4-6-113']
and, well, there's this small matter of the, um...:::['4-6-115']
dear? the matter of... ...payment.:::['4-6-116']
jack used to handle the finances.:::['4-6-117']
you know what we should all do? go see a musical.:::['4-6-118']
you know which one?:::['4-6-120']
the 1996 tony award winner.:::['4-6-121']
do you know the name of that one?:::['4-6-122']
i don't know, um, grease?:::['4-6-123']
rent?:::['4-6-125']
yes! rent!:::['4-6-126']
so when do you want to go?:::['4-6-127']
what? i'm sorry. i can't, i'm busy.:::['4-6-128']
man, it is so hard to shop for girls. ugh!:::['4-6-130']
yes, it is, at office max!:::['4-6-131']
what did you get her?:::['4-6-132']
a pen.:::['4-6-133']
it's two gifts in one. it's a pen that's also a clock. huh?:::['4-6-134']
ha, ha. you can't give her that. why not?:::['4-6-135']
she's not 11!:::['4-6-136']
and it's not the seventh night of chanukah.:::['4-6-137']
what he means by that is, while this is a very nice gift......maybe it's not something:::['4-6-138']
a boyfriend gives.:::['4-6-139']
sure, it is.:::['4-6-140']
she needs a pen for work.:::['4-6-141']
she's writing. she turns it over. "whoa! it's time for my date with joey!":::['4-6-142']
all right. what did you get for angela del veccio's birthday?:::['4-6-143']
she didn't have one.:::['4-6-144']
for three years?:::['4-6-145']
look, it's too late, and i got an audition. i can't shop anymore.:::['4-6-146']
i will go out and try to find something for her.:::['4-6-147']
while you're at it, could you get her a card?:::['4-6-149']
would you like me to write her a little poem as well?:::['4-6-150']
or just get a card that has a poem already in it.:::['4-6-151']
oh! you have to get our money. she couldn't stop crying.:::['4-6-152']
with those thick glasses, her tears look giant.:::['4-6-153']
i know, it's tough.:::['4-6-154']
you know what the first thing i did after my mom's funeral was?:::['4-6-155']
what? pay the caterer!:::['4-6-156']
i've had a lot of jobs.:::['4-6-157']
and there are some people who always try to get out of paying.:::['4-6-158']
it's either "that massage wasn't long enough"......or "i don't know:::['4-6-159']
any of those songs"......or "these sombreros aren't:::['4-6-160']
big enough. bad little white girl!":::['4-6-161']
so you think she's faking?:::['4-6-163']
there weren't any tears till you showed her the bill.:::['4-6-164']
she sounded pretty upset to me.:::['4-6-165']
playing on piano]:::['4-6-166', '4-6-215']
you're a grand old flag:::['4-6-167']
you're a high-flying flag and forever in peace may you wave:::['4-6-168']
she seems fine now.:::['4-6-169']
so you just left? her place was really that bad?:::['4-6-170']
you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day.:::['4-6-171']
like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage.:::['4-6-172']
and instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage.:::['4-6-173']
and instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time......and garbage is all:::['4-6-174']
that has survived.:::['4-6-175']
here. wow. thanks.:::['4-6-176']
so, uh, what happened?:::['4-6-177']
nothing. i had to get out of there.:::['4-6-178']
next time, you take her to your place.:::['4-6-179']
i tried that. she says it has a weird smell.:::['4-6-180']
what kind of smell? i don't know. soap?:::['4-6-181']
listen, you like this girl, right? yeah.:::['4-6-182']
you want to see her again? yeah.:::['4-6-183']
so you're going to have to do it in the mess!:::['4-6-184']
yeah, okay. you're right.:::['4-6-185']
i mean, uh, who cares about a little sloppiness?:::['4-6-186']
it's endearing, really. all right!:::['4-6-188']
now you go get that beautiful pig!:::['4-6-189']
i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present... ...for kathy that would be better than the rabbit.:::['4-6-190']
yeah, i found this great place called "invisible things for kathy.":::['4-6-192']
can you give me a hand with all this stuff?:::['4-6-193']
just return the book, let joey give her the clock pen......and you get her:::['4-6-194']
something worse than that......like a regular pen.:::['4-6-195']
she's really going to love this, you know?:::['4-6-196']
the bottom line is, i want her to have it......even if i don't get to be:::['4-6-197']
the one who gives it to her.:::['4-6-198']
aw, honey, that's so sweet.:::['4-6-199']
yeah? you don't think it's just pathetic?:::['4-6-200']
oh, "pathetic"!:::['4-6-201']
hey! i've been looking all over for you.:::['4-6-202']
where? our place. the hall.:::['4-6-203']
i got something.:::['4-6-204']
it's a book.:::['4-6-205']
a book?:::['4-6-206']
is it a book that's also a safe?:::['4-6-207']
it's a book that's just a book.:::['4-6-208']
it's the velveteen rabbit. it was her favorite as a kid.:::['4-6-209']
so, uh, just let me know if she likes it, okay?:::['4-6-210']
you got it. thanks for doing this. i owe you one.:::['4-6-211']
there wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?:::['4-6-212']
no, it came out to an even twenty.:::['4-6-213']
wow. that's almost as much as a new book.:::['4-6-214']
jeepers creepers:::['4-6-216']
where'd you get those peepers?:::['4-6-217']
jeepers creepers where'd you get those eyes?:::['4-6-218']
you didn't get the money?:::['4-6-219']
maybe i can try at intermission?:::['4-6-220']
you know what? let's just go.:::['4-6-221']
no! hey! we're not leaving till we get paid!:::['4-6-222']
i don't know who she thinks she is.:::['4-6-223']
enough is enough!:::['4-6-224']

oh, uh... don't forget your coupon.:::['4-6-289']
um, thank you for the gift.:::['4-6-291']
oh, uh, i just knew that sometimes when you're writing......you don't always:::['4-6-292']
know the exact time.:::['4-6-293']
no, i didn't mean the pen. thank you for the book.:::['4-6-294']
uh, the book? the velveteen rabbit?:::['4-6-295']
i have a feeling you had something to do with it.:::['4-6-296']
when joey gave it to me he said::::['4-6-298']
"this is because i know you like rabbits, and i know you like cheese.":::['4-6-299']
thanks. i love it.:::['4-6-300']
i know how hard it must have been for you to find.:::['4-6-301']
in case you missed that, that sound was, "oh, well.":::['4-6-302']
you must really like joey to go to all that trouble.:::['4-6-303']
oh, yeah. he's my...:::['4-6-304']
he's my best friend.:::['4-6-305']
well... good night.:::['4-6-306']
hey, that coupon expires, you know.:::['4-6-307']
hi, uh, you don't know me. i'm monica geller, ross' sister.:::['4-6-308']
you know, it's too bad that didn't work out.:::['4-6-309']
anyway, he told me about your apartment.:::['4-6-310']
well, i couldn't sleep thinking about it.:::['4-6-311']
so, uh, would it be okay if i cleaned it?:::['4-6-312']
phoebe: hey, new wallet?:::['4-4-0']
it was time.:::['4-4-1']
the old condom ring in the leather just doesn't say "cool" anymore.:::['4-4-2']
rachel, you just put an empty carton back in the fridge.:::['4-4-3']
i know, but the garbage was full.:::['4-4-4']
have you ever taken out the trash?:::['4-4-5']
well, i thought you liked doing it.:::['4-4-6']
third door on the left. right!:::['4-4-7']
hey, mr. treeger.:::['4-4-8']
um... oh! oh!:::['4-4-10']
it's a little old but...:::['4-4-12']
you're clogging up the chute i just unclogged.:::['4-4-13']
i'm sorry. i don't come in here a lot.:::['4-4-14']
aw, of course not. you're a little princess.:::['4-4-15']
daddy, buy me a pizza.:::['4-4-16']
daddy, buy me a candy factory.:::['4-4-17']
daddy, make the cast of cats sing "happy birthday" to me.:::['4-4-18']
you think you can come here......make a mess and a big man:::['4-4-19']
in coveralls will clean it up?:::['4-4-20']
think of someone else for a change.:::['4-4-21']
okay, i'm sorry.:::['4-4-22']
god, if you're going to cry about it!:::['4-4-23']
whoa, whoa! treeger made you cry? rachel: yes.:::['4-4-24']
he said really mean things that were only partly true.:::['4-4-25']
i'll teach him a lesson.:::['4-4-26']
joey, don't. let's forget about it.:::['4-4-27']
that's easy for you to say. you weren't almost just killed!:::['4-4-28']
all right, that's it. school is in session!:::['4-4-29']
my god.is this a gym card?:::['4-4-30']
oh, yeah, gym member.:::['4-4-31']
i try to go four times a week, but i've missed......the last 1200 times.:::['4-4-32']
so why don't you quit?:::['4-4-33']
you don't think i've tried?:::['4-4-34']
you think i like having $50 a month taken from my account?:::['4-4-35']
they make you go all the way down there.:::['4-4-36']
they use all these phrases and peppiness to confuse you.:::['4-4-37']
and then they bring out maria.:::['4-4-38']
who is maria? oh, maria!:::['4-4-39']
you can't say no to her.:::['4-4-40']
she's like this lycra, spandex-covered, gym treat.:::['4-4-41']
do you need me to go with you and hold your hand?:::['4-4-42']
no. you're strong enough to face her?:::['4-4-43']
oh, no. you'll have to come.:::['4-4-44']
tribbiani.:::['4-4-45']
hold on. i'll get the plunger.:::['4-4-46']
hey. you hold on. you made my friend rachel cry.:::['4-4-47']
so you'll go and apologize to her... ...unless you want me to call the landlord.:::['4-4-48']
and tell him what?:::['4-4-49']
maybe you haven't heard of "not making girls cry.":::['4-4-50']
maybe you haven't heard of the rent stabilization act of 1968.:::['4-4-51']
i have actually not heard of that.:::['4-4-52']
your friends are violating it.:::['4-4-53']
i've been nice until now, but i don't need this grief.:::['4-4-54']
i'm telling the landlord......monica's illegally:::['4-4-55']
subletting her grandmother's place.:::['4-4-56']
your friends are out of here, pal.:::['4-4-57']
why don't you tell me something i don't know?:::['4-4-58']
somebody tell me i don't have to work today.:::['4-4-59']
my first massage is this incredibly gorgeous guy.:::['4-4-61']
every time i see him, i want to......do things to him:::['4-4-62']
i can't charge for.:::['4-4-63']
so do them for free.:::['4-4-64']
no, it is forbidden.:::['4-4-65']
no, no. mrs. potter fires people for messing around with clients.:::['4-4-66']
and it's against my oath as a masseuse.:::['4-4-67']
they make you take one?:::['4-4-68']
no, i made myself take one.:::['4-4-69']
no fooling around with clients......and, um, always be prepared.:::['4-4-70']
that one's from the boy scouts, but it just makes good sense.:::['4-4-71']
why not give him to someone else?:::['4-4-72']
no, i can handle it. i'm a professional.:::['4-4-73']
pheebs, is that a new ankle bracelet?:::['4-4-74']
you got a pedicure. your feet are all dressed up.:::['4-4-75']
that's the only part he can see when he's on the table!:::['4-4-76']
you're going to do some feet flirting!:::['4-4-77']
i don't know what you're talking about. heh.:::['4-4-78']
how do you explain the toe ring?:::['4-4-79']
it's arabian princess day at work. leave me alone!:::['4-4-80']
my hero! what happened?:::['4-4-81']
well, i told him no one treats my friends like that.:::['4-4-82']
and he better apologize. see you!:::['4-4-83']
monica: wait a minute.:::['4-4-84']
what did he say? uh...:::['4-4-85']
he wouldn't apologize, because you're living here illegally.:::['4-4-86']
instead, he'll evict you. see you later!:::['4-4-87']
you got us evicted? i told you not to go down there.:::['4-4-88']
he made rachel cry!:::['4-4-89']
rachel always cries!:::['4-4-90']
that's not true!:::['4-4-91']
you go down there, and you suck up to him.:::['4-4-92']
you suck like you've never sucked before!:::['4-4-93']
all right, i'll try.:::['4-4-94']
if i can't, you stay with us till you get settled.:::['4-4-95']
go! all right, all right.:::['4-4-96']
i'll have to check first, but he'll be cool.:::['4-4-97']
whoa, whoa, whoa. remember what we talked about. you got to be strong. yes, yes!:::['4-4-98']
now one more time.:::['4-4-99']
don't you want a washboard stomach... ...and rock-hard pecs?:::['4-4-100']
no, i want a flabby gut and saggy man-breasts.:::['4-4-101']
i want to quit the gym.:::['4-4-103', '4-4-105', '4-4-107']
you want to quit?:::['4-4-104']
you do realize you won't have access to our new swedish spa?:::['4-4-106']
dave in the membership office handles quitters.:::['4-4-108']
excuse me. are you a member?:::['4-4-109']
no. sorry. members only.:::['4-4-111']
i want to quit the gym!:::['4-4-112']
it's okay, man. be strong.:::['4-4-113']
so are you a member of any gym?:::['4-4-114']
no, and i'm not going to be. so save your little speech.:::['4-4-115']
okay, no problem.:::['4-4-116']
could you come here?:::['4-4-117']
hi, i'm maria.:::['4-4-118']
hi, m...:::['4-4-119']
wow. you have really pretty feet.:::['4-4-120']
these old things? ha.:::['4-4-121']
would you spend time on my sciatic area? it's killing me.:::['4-4-122']
you mean... by sciatic, you mean......the towel-covered portion?:::['4-4-123']
sure, i can do that.:::['4-4-125']
because, um, the muscles in the sciatic area can get......real nice and tight.:::['4-4-126']
yeah. so, um, tell me, rick, how did you injure the area?:::['4-4-127']
a 16-hour sit-in for greenpeace.:::['4-4-128']
did you just bite me? no!:::['4-4-131']
please don't kick the girls out. this was my fault.:::['4-4-133']
you want me to kick you guys out instead?:::['4-4-134']
you can't. where would the chick and the duck live?:::['4-4-135']
you have pets? no. no, no, no.:::['4-4-136']
those are, uh, nicknames.:::['4-4-137']
i'm the chick, and chandler's the duck.:::['4-4-138']
huh. i would've thought it was the other way around.:::['4-4-139']
come on. let the girls stay.:::['4-4-140']
i'll do whatever you want.:::['4-4-141']
really? you'd do anything?:::['4-4-142']
yeah, absolutely.:::['4-4-143']
i got something. what is it?:::['4-4-144']
can you be my dancing partner?:::['4-4-145']
that's not prison lingo, is it?:::['4-4-146']
his dancing partner? yeah.:::['4-4-147']
there's this superintendents' dance, "the super ball.":::['4-4-148']
he wants to impress marge, this lady super he likes.:::['4-4-149']
why not practice with a girl?:::['4-4-150']
he's too shy.:::['4-4-151']
he's not good enough to dance with girls yet.:::['4-4-152']
he almost danced me right down that garbage chute.:::['4-4-154']
would you let it go already? you're fine.:::['4-4-155']
hey. so did you quit?:::['4-4-156']
no. i almost did.:::['4-4-157']
couldn't leave ross there without a spotter.:::['4-4-158']
wait, now, so you joined the gym?:::['4-4-159']
and that's funny, why?:::['4-4-160']
oh, ahem...:::['4-4-161']
i was just, you know, picturing you working out, and...:::['4-4-162']
we're doomed.:::['4-4-164']
they'll take $50 a month from our accounts for the rest of our lives.:::['4-4-165']
what'll we do?:::['4-4-166']
you could actually go to the gym.:::['4-4-167']
or... or we could go to the bank......close our accounts:::['4-4-168']
and cut them off at the source.:::['4-4-169']
oh, man! but then we won't be bank buddies.:::['4-4-171']
now there's two reasons.:::['4-4-172']
you guys, remember that cute client i told you about?:::['4-4-174']
i bit him.:::['4-4-175']
where? on the tushy.:::['4-4-176']
and that's not against your oath?:::['4-4-177']
i know, but the moment i touch him......i want to throw out my old oath:::['4-4-178']
and take a new, dirty one.:::['4-4-179']
next time, try to distract yourself.:::['4-4-180']
like when i'm doing something exciting......and i don't want to get too......excited.:::['4-4-181']
i try and think of other things. like, uh, sandwiches......and, uh, baseball......and, uh, chandler.:::['4-4-182']
thank you. oh, no, thank you.:::['4-4-183']
all right, i'm here. let's get this over with.:::['4-4-184']
okay, uh, well... ...just follow my lead.:::['4-4-185']
don't we need to do some kind of preparation first?:::['4-4-186']
like get really drunk?:::['4-4-187']
come on. hey, just put your arms around me.:::['4-4-188']
no. it's okay. but if i'm marge......my breasts are coming out my back.:::['4-4-190']
ah, forget it! i'm not being any good at this.:::['4-4-191']
my mom was right.:::['4-4-192']
i'm just a big potato with arms and legs and a head.:::['4-4-193']
come on, man. you're not a potato.:::['4-4-194']
i'm sure as hell not a dancer. it's no use.:::['4-4-195']
marge will never go for me.:::['4-4-196']
come on, treeger. don't say that.:::['4-4-197']
you just need more practice.:::['4-4-198']
come on. let's try it again.:::['4-4-199']
plus, it was probably mostly my fault anyway.:::['4-4-200']
i'm not that comfortable dancing with a... whee-hee!:::['4-4-201']
hey! yeah.:::['4-4-202']
so how goes the dancing? gay yet?:::['4-4-203']
ha-ha-ha. you guys owe me bigtime.:::['4-4-204']
what? you just did a little dancy thing.:::['4-4-206']
you did a little hop. you are so enjoying this.:::['4-4-208']
and it wasn't a hop. it was a pas de bourrée.:::['4-4-210']
you know the words! you are so into this!:::['4-4-211']
maybe i'm enjoying it a little. i'm getting pretty good at it.:::['4-4-212']
this is so sweet. joey, our little twinkletoes.:::['4-4-213']
this isn't some kind of girly dance.:::['4-4-214']
it's like a sport, it's manly.:::['4-4-215']
show me some "manly" moves. all right.:::['4-4-216']
i don't know how to lead.:::['4-4-217']
ross: hello. chandler: hi.:::['4-4-218']
we'd like to close our accounts.:::['4-4-219']
close your accounts? is there a problem?:::['4-4-220']
no, no. no, we'd just like to close them.:::['4-4-221']
okay... ms. lambert handles all our closures.:::['4-4-222']
would you come over here, please?:::['4-4-223']
hi, i'm karen.:::['4-4-224']
i want to quit the bank!:::['4-4-225']
okay. baseball.:::['4-4-226']
rick playing baseball. he slides into second.:::['4-4-227']
maybe even his pants come down a little. oh, no, wait! no.:::['4-4-228']
okay, sandwiches. sandwiches. um...:::['4-4-229']
okay, on a plate.:::['4-4-230']
maybe rick's pants come down a little. no! no!:::['4-4-231']
okay, chandler. ooh, that's working!:::['4-4-233']
chandler's knees.:::['4-4-234']
chandler's ankles. chandler's ankle hair.:::['4-4-235']
okay, you're all set. heh.:::['4-4-237']
oh, wow! that was amazing!:::['4-4-238']
was that really just an hour? yeah.:::['4-4-239']
in really long hour-world. what?:::['4-4-240']
ugh! okay...:::['4-4-241']
i have an enormous crush on you.:::['4-4-242']
but since you're a client, i can't ask you out... ...even though you give me the feelings.:::['4-4-243']
wow. i had no idea.:::['4-4-244']
but, uh... i can always find another masseuse.:::['4-4-245']
really? yeah, really.:::['4-4-246']
suddenly i'm very aware i'm naked.:::['4-4-248']
quiet down.:::['4-4-249']
mr. simon's been waiting... oh, my god!:::['4-4-250']
why wasn't i offered that?:::['4-4-251']
i'd definitely pay more for that.:::['4-4-252']
we have rules here. this is not that kind of place.:::['4-4-253']
i know, but this isn't how it looks at all......because rick is, um, my husband.:::['4-4-254']
potter: oh, really?:::['4-4-255']
you'd better tell his other wife. she called three times asking where he is.:::['4-4-256']
yes, i will tell her.:::['4-4-257']
so you didn't leave the bank? no.:::['4-4-258']
and somehow we ended up with a joint checking account.:::['4-4-259']
what will you ever use that for?:::['4-4-260']
to pay for the gym.:::['4-4-261']
so i had a great day.:::['4-4-263']
rick and i hit it off. we were making out.:::['4-4-264']
then my boss walked in and fired me for being a whore.:::['4-4-265']
you got fired? oh, my gosh!:::['4-4-267']
it's so weird. i have never been fired from anything.:::['4-4-268']
sweetie.:::['4-4-269']
i started walking around, not knowing what to do next.:::['4-4-270']
i started asking people on the street if they wanted massages.:::['4-4-271']
then these policemen thought i was a whore too.:::['4-4-272']
it's really been a bad day, whore-wise.:::['4-4-273']
hey, duck. is chick here?:::['4-4-274']
yeah, bunny rabbit.:::['4-4-275']
ready for our last practice?:::['4-4-276']
we're not getting that spin right, because my place is small.:::['4-4-277']
want to use our place? no, i had another idea.:::['4-4-278']
we did it!:::['4-4-279']
that was incredible!:::['4-4-280']
that was amazing! we totally nailed it!:::['4-4-281']
hey, listen. thanks a lot, tribbiani. heh.:::['4-4-282']
oh, my god! look at the time.:::['4-4-283']
i got to catch the bus to the ball.:::['4-4-284']
oh! okay...:::['4-4-285']
good luck. yeah.:::['4-4-286']
unless you want to practice the fox trot. or the tango?:::['4-4-287']
aw, thanks, but no.:::['4-4-288']
you see, i think i'm ready to dance with girls.:::['4-4-289']
okay, heh... go get them, treeger. right.:::['4-4-290']
you want to come? marge has a friend.:::['4-4-292']
you'd dance good with her. she's the same size as me.:::['4-4-294']
you've got great experience.:::['4-4-296']
let's see. reason for leaving last job?:::['4-4-297']
they thought i was a whore.:::['4-4-298']
okay. we'll give you a call if anything comes up.:::['4-4-299']
great. thank you very much.:::['4-4-300']
hello!:::['4-5-0']
oh, right! it's that girl's phone number.:::['4-5-2']
there it is. just a phone number... ...a really hot girl gave me.:::['4-5-3']
no big deal. i mean, it is her home phone number but...:::['4-5-4']
whoops! heh. almost lost this baby!:::['4-5-6']
the lovely amanda gives me her number, and i go and drop it.:::['4-5-7']
rachel? yeah? when's your birthday? may 5th. why?:::['4-5-9']
i'm making a list of birthdays.:::['4-5-10']
mine's december... yeah, whatever.:::['4-5-11']
chandler: oh! she's pretty!:::['4-5-12']
pretty, uh, pretty girl. the pretty... she's pretty.:::['4-5-13']

he's a little sensitive right now because he's so in love!:::['4-5-99']
monica: ooh, kathy! kathy, i love you!:::['4-5-101']
i need to write some depressing stuff for my new bluesy voice.:::['4-5-102']
but nothing sad has ever happened to me.:::['4-5-103']
how about your mom dying?:::['4-5-104']
or living on the streets when you were 14?:::['4-5-105']
i could write about when my hair did that woo-hoo thing.:::['4-5-107']
hey. monica & phoebe: hey.:::['4-5-108', '3-14-100']
i'm going over to amanda's tonight.:::['4-5-109']
rachel's not here. oh.:::['4-5-110']
how's it going with her?:::['4-5-111']
great, actually. i'm thinking tonight may be the night.:::['4-5-112']
the kids will play together, and when they're asleep......amanda and i break:::['4-5-113']
open a bottle of wine......do a little playing ourselves.:::['4-5-114']
hi, guys! this is josh.:::['4-5-115']
josh, these are my friends.:::['4-5-116']

didn't you play soccer in high school?:::['4-5-122']
no, wait. you organized their game schedules on your commodore 64.:::['4-5-123']
it's getting late. i got to get to the game, so i'll... head.:::['4-5-124']
i'll miss you.:::['4-5-125']
dope!:::['4-5-126']

very cute. i know. isn't he great?:::['4-5-128']
so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, you know?:::['4-5-129']
there's nothing boring about him.:::['4-5-130']
i bet he's never set foot in a museum.:::['4-5-131']
maybe he'll get to go soon.:::['4-5-132']
like on a class trip or something.:::['4-5-133']
you know what else is great about him?:::['4-5-134']
ugh, what's the word for an adult... ...who has no dinosaur toys in their bedroom?:::['4-5-135']
monica knows.:::['4-5-138']
it's this dumb thing ross made up to fool our parents.:::['4-5-139']
it's a way of giving the finger without actually giving it.:::['4-5-140']
i cried the night you made that up.:::['4-5-141']
it was the first time i realized i was cooler than my big brother.:::['4-5-142']
i'm going to go get ready......for my date tonight......so i'll just head.:::['4-5-143']
i should go too. i'm playing in one hour.:::['4-5-144']
you guys should come hear me. ooh!:::['4-5-146']

ross: hi. hi. hi, ben.:::['4-5-151']

yeah, okay...:::['4-5-153']
hey, tommy!:::['4-5-154']
i'm so glad you could come tonight.:::['4-5-155']
oh, no. it's my pleasure.:::['4-5-156']
my cell phone number is on the counter. help yourself to the fridge.:::['4-5-157']
i appreciate this. i've been trying to date... ...this guy for a month.:::['4-5-158']
uh, i'd appreciate it if you'd drink your wine... ...after the kids are asleep.:::['4-5-160']
thanks for this. i hope i can do the same for you sometime.:::['4-5-162']
who wants to make some long-distance calls?:::['4-5-163']
kathy! kathy!:::['4-5-164', '4-5-168']
hi, kathy! kathy!:::['4-5-165']
kathy!:::['4-5-166', '4-5-169']
fetch! fetch it!:::['4-5-167']
hey. chandler, what are you doing here?:::['4-5-170']
i just wanted to say, "hey!":::['4-5-171']
hey! okay.:::['4-5-172']
you're making it sound worse than it was.:::['4-5-173']
her date tipped me $10!:::['4-5-174']
i want to be sexy again, so i'm trying to catch a cold.:::['4-5-176']
should be easy. they're pretty common.:::['4-5-177']
monica: you'll catch pneumonia!:::['4-5-178']
you were right. i'm in love with joey's girlfriend.:::['4-5-179']
how's that possible? you barely know her.:::['4-5-181']
i don't know. i just...:::['4-5-182']
i can't get her out of my head.:::['4-5-183']
i'm a very bad person. i'm a very, very bad person.:::['4-5-184']
i'm a horrible person.:::['4-5-185']
"no, you're not. we still love you, chandler!":::['4-5-186']
phoebe, i think i caught your cold.:::['4-5-187']
you mean you stole it!:::['4-5-188']
don't cover your mouth when you do that!:::['4-5-189']
we were just talking about you.:::['4-5-191']
the time you got drunk and fell asleep... ...with your head in the toilet.:::['4-5-193']
right in there!:::['4-5-194']
ninety-nine......a hundred.:::['4-5-195']
ready or not, here i come!:::['4-5-196']
let's go over the concept one more time.:::['4-5-197']
you want to get some dinner with me and kathy tonight?:::['4-5-199']
oh, um... you know what? i already ate.:::['4-5-200']
it's 4:30. i had a big meal on monday.:::['4-5-201']
so that'll get me straight through the week.:::['4-5-202']
i see what's going on here.:::['4-5-203']
you don't like kathy.:::['4-5-205']
you've been avoiding her since we started dating.:::['4-5-207']
i made an effort to like janice.:::['4-5-208']
now you make an effort to like kathy by going out with us. right?:::['4-5-209']
yeah, right. good. and hey, my treat.:::['4-5-210']
because you're not eating, right? right.:::['4-5-211']
ross isn't here.:::['4-5-212']
oh. stop it!:::['4-5-213']
i'll see you at the party?:::['4-5-214']
beer's fear, man! 24/7!:::['4-5-215']
i am so going to marry that guy.:::['4-5-217']
ugh! what?:::['4-5-218']
i think he's stealing from me.:::['4-5-219']
why? because he's stealing from me!:::['4-5-220']
hi, it's me. rachel: hi. and soup.:::['4-5-221']
i saw josh. he looked yummy in your leather jacket.:::['4-5-222']
i don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.:::['4-5-223']
there's no chicken in the broth, so it's really noodle water.:::['4-5-224']
monica: thank you so much. sure.:::['4-5-225']
i need your germs. i want my cold back.:::['4-5-227']
i miss my sexy voice.:::['4-5-228']
sorry, phoebe.:::['4-5-229']
how's the soup? mm.:::['4-5-231']
oh! check it out! you can see that girl's underwear.:::['4-5-233']
is she great, or what? ha, ha.:::['4-5-234']
huh? what do you think?:::['4-5-235']
she's not really my type.:::['4-5-236']
not your type? she's gorgeous.:::['4-5-237']
you know what it is? the fishnet stockings.:::['4-5-238']
whenever i see a girl in those, it reminds me of......my father in fishnet stockings.:::['4-5-239']
understanding a little more of why you're single.:::['4-5-240']
i have a friend you'd like. we could double date.:::['4-5-241']
i've got some ugly friends who are available too.:::['4-5-243']
i'm going to grab a beer.:::['4-5-244']
kathy's being really nice and you walked away.:::['4-5-247']
what do you want from me?:::['4-5-248']
i want you to like her.:::['4-5-249']
if that's too damn difficult, then at least you could pretend.:::['4-5-250']
i am pretending.:::['4-5-251']
then do it better.:::['4-5-252']
what do you say, i go tell her how much i like her?:::['4-5-253']
i could tell her i've been thinking of her.:::['4-5-254']
i haven't stopped thinking of her since we met.:::['4-5-255']
i'm so over-the-top, want-to-slit-my-own-throat......in love with her,that every minute......i can't believe my own damn bad luck:::['4-5-256']
that you met her first!:::['4-5-257']
that's pretty good.:::['4-5-258']
but you might want to tone it down a little.:::['4-5-259']
hey. uh, amanda just dropped me off.:::['4-5-260']
that's one of the things i love about her.:::['4-5-261']
she's old enough to drive.:::['4-5-262']
you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?:::['4-5-263']
where's amanda?:::['4-5-265']
get me some cough drops.:::['4-5-266']
i'm thinking you could bring her......and go to your old room:::['4-5-267']
and not make out.:::['4-5-268']
cough drop, please?:::['4-5-269']
at least she's not going out with me... ...to get into r-rated movies.:::['4-5-270']
why don't you marry her?:::['4-5-271']
wait, you can't! i forgot. she's not a lesbian.:::['4-5-272']
amanda and i... you have nothing!:::['4-5-273']
you're not even going out! you're her babysitter.:::['4-5-274']
you have a 12-year-old girl's job!:::['4-5-275']
oh, that is so sad.:::['4-5-276']
what are you laughing at, miss my-keg-sucking-boyfriend... ...- is-stealing-from me?:::['4-5-277']
so he stole a few bucks. big deal! he got me something with it.:::['4-5-278']
that's mine!:::['4-5-279']
would you both please start acting like adults?:::['4-5-280']
and give me my cough drops!:::['4-5-281']
fine. sorry.:::['4-5-282']
at least i made $10 in my relationship.:::['4-5-284']
parading goats are parading:::['4-5-286', '4-5-288']
parading down the street:::['4-5-287']
leaving little treats:::['4-5-289']
does it even work without my sexy voice?:::['4-5-290']
gunther, kiss me. what?:::['4-5-292']
do it, deputy! do something!:::['4-5-293']
we aren't exactly sleeping in here, but do you mind?:::['4-5-295']
can i sleep on your couch?:::['4-5-296']
and i'm still waiting for my papier-maché man:::['4-5-297']
thank you, my babies.:::['4-5-298']
rachel? rachel: yeah?:::['4-5-299']
did you hear what happened between me and phoebe?:::['4-5-300']
no. we kissed.:::['4-5-301']
i didn't initiate it, but i also didn't stop it.:::['4-5-302']
i've been feeling guilty.:::['4-5-303']
so, um... ...are we cool?:::['4-5-305']
i knew you would understand.:::['4-5-307']
okay, so we went to the beach because phoebe found out about this lady......who knew her mom and dad......and i don't really know:::['4-1-0']
what happened with that.:::['4-1-1']
i'm your mother. huh?:::['4-1-2']
joey: monica joked that she wouldn't go out with a guy like chandler.:::['4-1-3']
hi there. joey: he couldn't let it go.:::['4-1-4']
i don't really know what happened with that. and then ross' new girlfriend shows up......and rachel convinced her:::['4-1-5']
to shave her head. and then ross and rachel kiss.:::['4-1-6']
and now ross has to choose between rachel and the bald girl.:::['4-1-7']
and i don't know what happened there either.:::['4-1-8']
you know what? hold on. let me go get chandler.:::['4-1-9']
rachel was just helping me out. my head got all sunburned.:::['4-1-12']
thanks a million. oh, you're welcome a million.:::['4-1-14']
okay, i'll be in our room. uh.:::['4-1-15']
okay, i gotta go. whoa. what? why?:::['4-1-18']
uh, i gotta go break up with bonnie.:::['4-1-19']
here? now?:::['4-1-20']
well, yeah, i can't stay here all night.:::['4-1-21']
and if i go in there, she's gonna want to......do stuff.:::['4-1-22']
can't you just tell here that you are not in the mood?:::['4-1-23']
no, she likes that.:::['4-1-24']
ha, ha. yeah, faking sleep doesn't work either.:::['4-1-25']
i can't tell you how many mornings i woke up with her...:::['4-1-26']
oh. oh, okay.:::['4-1-27']
ha, ha. yeah, why am i telling you? i don't know. ha, ha.:::['4-1-28']
uh, uh...:::['4-1-29']
it wasn't every morning... oh, making it worse.:::['4-1-30']
so i guess you'd like to know how it all happened.:::['4-1-32']
i mean, well, i think i can figure it out.:::['4-1-33']
i guess, you know, i was born... ...and then everyone started lying their asses off.:::['4-1-34']
no, no, it wasn't like that.:::['4-1-35']
i mean, remember how i told you how lily and frank and i, we were close?:::['4-1-36']
well, we were very close.:::['4-1-37']
how close?:::['4-1-38']
well, the three of us, we were kind of a, um... a couple.:::['4-1-39']
i don't even know how that would work. well, we...:::['4-1-40']
i'm not asking.:::['4-1-41']
well, anyhow, somehow i got pregnant......and i was......scared. i was stupid and selfish and...:::['4-1-42']
i was 18 years old.:::['4-1-43']
i mean, you remember what it was like to be 18 years old, don't you? yeah. let's see, my mom had killed herself and my dad had run off.:::['4-1-44']
and i was living in a gremlin with a guy named cindy, who talked to his hand.:::['4-1-45']
i thought i was leaving you with the best parents in the world.:::['4-1-47']
i didn't even hear about your mom and dad till a couple of years ago.:::['4-1-48']
and by then, you were already grown-up.:::['4-1-49']
i don't know. you're here and i would really... i would like to get to know you.:::['4-1-50']
yeah, well, everybody does. ha, ha.:::['4-1-51']
i'm a really cool person.:::['4-1-52']
and you know, you had 29 years to find that out... ...but you didn't even try.:::['4-1-53']
you know what? you walked out on me, and i'm gonna do the same to you.:::['4-1-54']
wait. okay? i don't ever want to see you again.:::['4-1-55']
where's my purse?:::['4-1-56']
shoot. we're out of soda.:::['4-1-57']
chandler: oh, i'll go out and get you some.:::['4-1-58']
really? no, because i'm not your boyfriend.:::['4-1-59']
hey, pheebs, how'd it go?:::['4-1-60']
huh. well, ahem... my mom's friend, phoebe, is actually my birth mom.:::['4-1-61']
i found a dried-up seahorse.:::['4-1-62']
sweetie, what are you talking about?:::['4-1-63']
oh, my new mom, who's a big fat abandoner.:::['4-1-64']
oh, wait, pheebs. wait a second. don't you want to stay here and talk about it?:::['4-1-65']
no. i just... i wanna... i need to be alone.:::['4-1-66']
monica. oh.:::['4-1-67']
it's over.:::['4-1-68']
oh. was it awful? well, it was long.:::['4-1-69']
i didn't even realize how late it was......till i noticed the five o'clock shadow:::['4-1-70']
on her head.:::['4-1-71']
anyway, she didn't want to stay. i called a cab. she just left.:::['4-1-72']
i wrote you a letter.:::['4-1-73']
oh, thank you. ha, ha.:::['4-1-74']
i like mail.:::['4-1-75']
there's just some things i've been thinking about.:::['4-1-76']
you know, things about us.:::['4-1-77']
and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together......i just need to know:::['4-1-78']
how you feel about this stuff.:::['4-1-79']
okay. heh. okay.:::['4-1-80']
well, it's...:::['4-1-81']
it's 5:30 in the morning. heh.:::['4-1-82']
so i'd better get cracking on this baby.:::['4-1-83']
so i'll be waiting for you. just come up when you're done.:::['4-1-84']
okay. i'll be up......in 18 pages.:::['4-1-85']
front and back.:::['4-1-86']
very exciting.:::['4-1-87']
what happened to you? why didn't you come up?:::['4-1-90']
you just finished? well, i wanted to be thorough.:::['4-1-92']
i mean, this is clearly very, very important to you. to us.:::['4-1-93']
and so i wanted to read every word carefully.:::['4-1-94']
does it?:::['4-1-97', '4-1-99']
yeah, i wanted to give that whole "does it?" part just another glance.:::['4-1-100']
what are you talking about, ross? you just said that you read it twice.:::['4-1-101']
look, you know what? it either does or doesn't. and if you have to think...:::['4-1-102']
no, rach. no, i don't have to think about it. i don't.:::['4-1-103']
uh, in fact......i've decided. i have decided......that it......does.:::['4-1-104']
are you sure? oh, sure, i'm sure.:::['4-1-105']
all right. there's a nuclear holocaust. i'm the last man on earth.:::['4-1-106']
ehh.:::['4-1-108']
i've got canned goods.:::['4-1-109']
hey, you guys, take a look at this.:::['4-1-110']

oh, it's, like, two miles.:::['4-1-118']
yeah, and i'm a little tired from digging the hole.:::['4-1-119']
damn the jellyfish.:::['4-1-120']
damn all the jellyfish.:::['4-1-121']
we've gotta do something. there's only one thing you can do.:::['4-1-122']
you're gonna have to pee on it.:::['4-1-124']
what? gross.:::['4-1-125']
don't blame me. i saw it on the discovery channel.:::['4-1-126']
you know what? he's right. there's something like ammonia in that......that kills the pain.:::['4-1-127']
well, forget it. it doesn't hurt that bad!:::['4-1-128']
if you want some privacy, you can use my hole.:::['4-1-129']
well, i'm ready to get the hell out of here.:::['4-1-130']
are you...?:::['4-1-132']
are you?:::['4-1-133', '3-11-317']
oh, that's so great.:::['4-1-134']
ooh, not for bonnie.:::['4-1-135']
but for you, yay, aah.:::['4-1-136']
hey. rachel: how was the beach?:::['4-1-137']
nothing. i don't know. uh, let's not worry about it.:::['4-1-138']
ross: what happened? nothing.:::['4-1-139']
i'm gonna take a shower. chandler: me too.:::['4-1-140']
joey: me too.:::['4-1-141', '3-2-112']
okay, i'm gonna put this in the car.:::['4-1-142']
oh, i have to go pack. oh!:::['4-1-143']
and it really does? it does.:::['4-1-144']
it really and truly does.:::['4-1-145']
it so does not.:::['4-1-147']
she wants me to take responsibility... ...for everything that went wrong in our relationship.:::['4-1-148']
i mean, she goes on for five pages about how i was unfaithful to her.:::['4-1-149']
oh, my god. if you say that one more time, i'm gonna break up with you.:::['4-1-151']
but this breakup was not all my fault. and she says here::::['4-1-153']
"if you accept full responsibility..." full responsibility.:::['4-1-154']
"...i can begin to trust you again.:::['4-1-155']
does that seem like something you can do? does it?":::['4-1-156']
look, ross, you have what you want. you're back with rachel.:::['4-1-158']
you're gonna wreck the best thing that ever happened to you.:::['4-1-159']
yeah, i know. i know, you're right.:::['4-1-160']
yeah, i guess i'll let it go.:::['4-1-161']
but you understand how hard it is to forget about this?:::['4-1-162']
joey: sure, it's hard to forget......but that doesn't mean:::['4-1-163']
you have to talk about it.:::['4-1-164']
a lot of things happened on that trip... ...that we should never, ever talk about.:::['4-1-165']
what the hell happened on that beach?:::['4-1-166']
it's between us and the sea, ross.:::['4-1-167']
hi, ursula. hey.:::['4-1-168']
okay, well, um, i know that we haven't talked in a long time.:::['4-1-169']
but, um, okay, our mom is not our birth mom. this other lady is our birth mom.:::['4-1-170']
right, okay, the one that lives in montauk. mm-hm.:::['4-1-171']
you know her?:::['4-1-172']
no. i, um... i read about her in mom's suicide note.:::['4-1-173']
there was a suicide note? well, do you still have it?:::['4-1-174']
i can't believe you didn't tell me there was a suicide note.:::['4-1-176']
ursula: yeah, so how have you been doing?:::['4-1-177']
i... shut up.:::['4-1-178']
"goodbye, phoebe and ursula. i'll miss you.:::['4-1-179']
p.s. your mom lives in montauk.":::['4-1-180']
you just wrote this.:::['4-1-181']
well, it's pretty much the gist.:::['4-1-182']
except for the poem. you read the poem, right?:::['4-1-183']
all right. hang on.:::['4-1-185']
pass the cheese, please.:::['4-1-186']
my god, you can't even look at me, can you?:::['4-1-188']
yay, it's phoebe. we can talk to phoebe.:::['4-1-190']
no, i'm too depressed to talk.:::['4-1-191']
i'll give you $1000 to talk to us.:::['4-1-192']
hey, you guys... ...what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?:::['4-1-193']
all: no.:::['4-1-194']
all right, that's it, you guys. what happened out there?:::['4-1-195']
what? we took a walk. nothing happened.:::['4-1-196']
i came back with nothing all over me.:::['4-1-197']
come on, what happened? joey? what does that mean?:::['4-1-198']
all right. no.:::['4-1-199']
joey, we swore we'd never tell.:::['4-1-200']
they'll never understand.:::['4-1-201']
but we have to say something. we have to get it out. it's eating me alive.:::['4-1-202']
monica got stung by a jellyfish. all right.:::['4-1-203']
i got stung.:::['4-1-205']
stung bad.:::['4-1-206']
i couldn't stand. i...:::['4-1-207']
i couldn't walk.:::['4-1-208']
we were two miles from the house.:::['4-1-209']
we were scared and alone.:::['4-1-210']
we didn't think we could make it.:::['4-1-211']
i was in too much pain.:::['4-1-212']
and i was tired from digging the huge hole.:::['4-1-213']
and then joey remembered something.:::['4-1-214']
i'd seen this thing on the discovery channel.:::['4-1-215']
wait a minute, i saw that.:::['4-1-216']
on the discovery channel. yeah, about jellyfish and how if you...:::['4-1-217']
you peed on yourself?:::['4-1-219']
phoebe & rachel: ew.:::['4-1-220']
you can't say that. you don't know.:::['4-1-221']
i thought i was gonna pass out from the pain.:::['4-1-222']
anyway, i tried, but i couldn't......bend that way.:::['4-1-223']
rachel & ross & phoebe: ew.:::['4-1-225']
that's right. i stepped up.:::['4-1-226']
only, uh, i couldn't.:::['4-1-229']
i got the stage fright.:::['4-1-230']
i wanted to help, but there was just too much pressure......so i, uh... i turned to chandler.:::['4-1-231']
joey kept screaming at me, "do it now. do it. do it. do it now.":::['4-1-232']
sometimes, late at night, i can still hear the screaming.:::['4-1-233']
that's because, sometimes, i just do it through my wall to freak you out.:::['4-1-234']
and fuchsia and mauve:::['4-1-235']
those are the 66 colors of my bedroom:::['4-1-236']
oh, and i invite all of you to count the colors in your bedroom.:::['4-1-238']
except for you. you go away.:::['4-1-239']
i'll go in a second.:::['4-1-240']
i just want to tell you......that there hasn't been a day:::['4-1-241']
when i didn't regret giving you up.:::['4-1-242']
no, i'm not done.:::['4-1-244']
i just want you to know, the reason i never looked you up was because......well, i was afraid that you'd react......just, well, like the way:::['4-1-245']
you're reacting now.:::['4-1-246']
can't we just, you know, start from here? please?:::['4-1-247']
but just one last thing.:::['4-1-251']
you know, you came looking for family.:::['4-1-252']
i'm family.:::['4-1-253']
i'm it.:::['4-1-254']
well, now i'm done.:::['4-1-255']
yeah, but it's not like we're losing anything, you know?:::['4-1-256']
it's not like we know each other or anything or that have anything in common.:::['4-1-258']
oh, i don't know. i mean, it's not like we don't have anything in common.:::['4-1-259']
i mean, i like, uh, pizza.:::['4-1-260']
i... i like pizza.:::['4-1-261']
wait, i like, um, the beatles.:::['4-1-263']
oh, my god. so do i!:::['4-1-264']
i knew it. wow.:::['4-1-265']
wait, wait, wait. puppies. cute or ugly?:::['4-1-266']
oh, so cute. oh!:::['4-1-267']
well? ha, ha. you see?:::['4-1-268']
but i'm still... i'm mad at you.:::['4-1-269']
i'm mad at me too.:::['4-1-271']
well, um, do you want to get something to eat? because i'm kind of hungry.:::['4-1-272']
hey. me too.:::['4-1-273']
all right, stop it. now you're just doing it to freak me out.:::['4-1-274']
aw, i missed you.:::['4-1-275']
i missed you too.:::['4-1-276']
oh, i was so nervous about that letter.:::['4-1-277']
but the way you owned up to everything......it just showed me:::['4-1-278']
how much you've grown, you know?:::['4-1-279']
i suppose.:::['4-1-280']
no. you have, ross. you have. you should give yourself credit.:::['4-1-281']
heh. she was all, "once a cheater, always a cheater.":::['4-1-283']
mm-hm. oh.:::['4-1-284']
ross: we were on a break!:::['4-1-287']
coffeehouse? you bet.:::['4-1-288']
and for the record, it took two people to break up this relationship.:::['4-1-289']
yeah, you and that girl from the copy place... ...which yesterday you took full responsibility for.:::['4-1-290']
yeah, it was 5:30 in the morning.:::['4-1-295']
oh, oh, oh. and by the way.:::['4-1-298']
"y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e" means "you are.":::['4-1-299']
"y-o-u-r" means "your.":::['4-1-300']
rachel: oh, and hey, hey, hey. those spelling tips will come in handy when you're at home on saturday nights......playing scrabble with monica.:::['4-1-303']
hey. sorry.:::['4-1-304']
i just feel bad about all that sleep you're gonna miss, wishing you were with me.:::['4-1-305']
oh, no, no. don't you worry about me falling asleep.:::['4-1-306']
i still have your letter!:::['4-1-307']
and hey, just so you know, it's not that common.:::['4-1-308']
it doesn't happen to every guy and it is a big deal!:::['4-1-309']
gin.:::['4-1-311']
we were playing gin?:::['4-1-312']
you know, if we were a couple, we could play this game naked.:::['4-1-313']
ha, ha. would you stop? okay.:::['4-1-314']
okay, all right. i think you're great.:::['4-1-316']
i think you're sweet and you're smart......and i love you.:::['4-1-317']
but you will always be the guy who peed on me.:::['4-1-318']
wow. that ripped.:::['4-2-0']
that ripped real nice.:::['4-2-1']
how many times do i have to tell you? you turn and slide.:::['4-2-2']
you know? turn and slide.:::['4-2-3']
no, you don't turn and slide.:::['4-2-4']
you throw it out.:::['4-2-5']
i'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot every time i get dressed.:::['4-2-6']
well, we're not throwing it out. i built this thing with my own hands.:::['4-2-7']
all right. how about we sell it?:::['4-2-8']
but you're gonna have to tell them.:::['4-2-10']
you mind if we stick you in a different cabinet? they seem all right with it.:::['4-2-11']
who's chip? shh.:::['4-2-13']
chip: it was good running into you today.:::['4-2-14']
so, uh, here's my number. 555-9323. give me a call. later.:::['4-2-15']
chip is chip matthews.:::['4-2-16']
the guy who took rachel to the prom? why's he calling you?:::['4-2-17']
because i ran into him at the bank. he is still so cute.:::['4-2-18']
monica, you're so lucky. he's, like, the most popular guy in school.:::['4-2-19']
chip? hi, it's monica.:::['4-2-21']
oh, my god. we just had the best conversation.:::['4-2-24']
i was just leaving. rachel: good.:::['4-2-25']
because i've got a product report to read.:::['4-2-26']
it's, like, eight pages. i hope i don't fall asleep.:::['4-2-27']
why? did you write it?:::['4-2-28']
chip matthews called. i wonder what he wants.:::['4-2-31']
well, uh, actually...:::['4-2-32']
i bet he sensed that i was ready to have sex with another guy.:::['4-2-33']
why don't you give him a call?:::['4-2-35']
are you sure you want to hear this? oh, i'm sure.:::['4-2-37']
chip. hi, it's rachel.:::['4-2-38']
yeah. um, you left me a message?:::['4-2-40']
yes, you did. my roommate wrote it down.:::['4-2-41']
monica geller?:::['4-2-42']
he called to ask out monica.:::['4-2-45']
that's got to be embarrassing.:::['4-2-46']
dumb drunken bitch:::['4-2-47']
thank you. thanks. ha, ha.:::['4-2-48']
now here's a question.:::['4-2-49']
where'd you guys get the "finest oak east of the mississippi"?:::['4-2-50']
uh-uh. first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.:::['4-2-51']
i'm reading your ad.:::['4-2-52']
looks good, huh? ross: yeah.:::['4-2-53']
"stunning entertainment center, fine...:::['4-2-54']
fine italian craftsmanship.":::['4-2-55']
oh, my god. you guys are selling the entertainment center?:::['4-2-56']
why? i love that thing. you want it?:::['4-2-57']
oh, no. no.:::['4-2-58']
uh, gepetto?:::['4-2-59']
five thousand dollars?:::['4-2-60']
hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks.:::['4-2-62']
all right, look, i'm changing it to $50 or your best offer.:::['4-2-63']
what kind of profit is that? and you call yourself an accountant?:::['4-2-64']
what do you do?:::['4-2-67']
i can't believe you don't know what i do for a living.:::['4-2-68']
i actually don't know. yeah, something to do with numbers?:::['4-2-69']
oh, my god, no. shoo, kitty. no.:::['4-2-70']
no, no. shoo. come on, you. come on.:::['4-2-71']
what? what's wrong?:::['4-2-75']
i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother.:::['4-2-77']
you mean, the mom you met in montauk? she was a cat?:::['4-2-78']
no. no, no. she was a human lady.:::['4-2-79']
this is the spirit of my mom, lily. the one that killed herself.:::['4-2-80']
are you sure she's in the cat? or have you been taking your grandma's glaucoma medicine again?:::['4-2-81']
no, dr. skeptismo.:::['4-2-82']
i'm sure. first of all, okay, there's the feeling.:::['4-2-83']
okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case......which is lined with orange felt.:::['4-2-84']
my mother's favorite fish was orange roughy.:::['4-2-85']
cats like fish.:::['4-2-86']
hi, mommy.:::['4-2-87']
oh. i haven't seen this smile in 17 years.:::['4-2-88']
dude, phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of... let it go.:::['4-2-89']
um, when were you gonna tell me that you're going out with chip matthews?:::['4-2-91']
is it okay if i go out with chip matthews? no. it's not okay.:::['4-2-93']
i can't believe you'd want to after what he did to me.:::['4-2-94']
what, that thing at the prom?:::['4-2-95']
monica, i couldn't find him for two hours. he was having sex with amy welsh.:::['4-2-96']
come on, that was back in high school. how could that still bother you?:::['4-2-97']
i mean, why of all people do you have to go out with chip?:::['4-2-98']
look, you and i went to different schools.:::['4-2-99']
okay, that doesn't help because we went to the same high school.:::['4-2-100']
you went to one where you were popular.:::['4-2-101']
and you got to ride off on chip's motorcycle... ...and wear his letterman jacket.:::['4-2-102']
i went to one where i wore a band uniform that you had to have specially made.:::['4-2-103']
they had to have that specially made?:::['4-2-104']
it was a project for one of the home ec. classes.:::['4-2-105']
oh, my god. they told us that was for the mascot.:::['4-2-106']
back then i thought that i'd never, ever get the chance... ...to go out with a chip matthews.:::['4-2-107']
and now he's called me up and asked me out.:::['4-2-108']
and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. i owe her this.:::['4-2-109']
i never let her eat.:::['4-2-110']
oh, you go out with him. oh, really?:::['4-2-111']
if it's possible, could you leave him somewhere... ...and go have sex with another guy?:::['4-2-113']
i'll try.:::['4-2-114']
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?:::['4-2-115']
there were a couple calls last night... ...but, uh, i don't think any of them are gonna work out.:::['4-2-116']
yes, joey has a very careful screening process.:::['4-2-117']
apparently not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.:::['4-2-118']
stop it. stop it.:::['4-2-119']
she keeps squirming and trying to get away.:::['4-2-120']
just like when she was alive.:::['4-2-121']
so, pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?:::['4-2-122']
well, i'm not sure.:::['4-2-123']
i mean, i guess until she, you know, gets used to the fact that there's......you know, a new mom.:::['4-2-124']
you know, i think she's worried that she's gonna be replaced.:::['4-2-125']
well, that's not gonna happen, is it? no.:::['4-2-126']
okay, i have to return a call in the other room.:::['4-2-127']
why can't you use the phone in here?:::['4-2-128']
well, i'm returning a call from a certain mom at the b-e-a-c-h.:::['4-2-129']
i just spelled the wrong word.:::['4-2-130']
so, guys, am i crazy or does phoebe's mom remind anyone else of a cat?:::['4-2-131']
ross, don't start. ross: come on.:::['4-2-132']
you can't tell me you actually believe that there's a woman inside that cat?:::['4-2-133']
i believe it.:::['4-2-134']
ross: no, you...:::['4-2-136']
you're not gonna suck me into this.:::['4-2-138']
oh, sure i am. because you always have to be right.:::['4-2-139']
i do not always have... okay, okay.:::['4-2-140']
jurassic park could happen.:::['4-2-141']
wow. that's, uh... that's pretty nice.:::['4-2-142']
"pretty nice"?:::['4-2-143']
you'll have to pardon my roommate. he wanted to marry this.:::['4-2-144']
we don't have 50 bucks. but would you be willing to trade for it?:::['4-2-145']
we got a canoe.:::['4-2-146']
you know, i really don't think we need a canoe.:::['4-2-147']
you gotta take the canoe.:::['4-2-148']
all right, just... just take the entertainment center.:::['4-2-149']
and then when you get home, throw the canoe away.:::['4-2-150']
we're not throwing it away. i built that canoe.:::['4-2-151']
you guys, you're never gonna believe what i just found on a telephone pole.:::['4-2-153']
looks kind of familiar?:::['4-2-154']
apparently phoebe's mother also goes by the name julio.:::['4-2-155']
you guys, there's a little girl in soho looking for this cat.:::['4-2-156']
i mean, you know what that means? yeah, 200-dollar reward split five ways.:::['4-2-157']
do we have to tell her?:::['4-2-158']
yes, we have to tell her. oh, but it's made her so happy.:::['4-2-159']
little girl misses her cat.:::['4-2-160']
crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.:::['4-2-161']
okay, ha, ha, you know what? i have to go have dinner with my son.:::['4-2-162']
can i trust that when you see phoebe, you will tell her?:::['4-2-163']
ugh. i hate it when ross is right.:::['4-2-166']
he is right, isn't he? you know what?:::['4-2-167']
this might be one of the times when he's wrong.:::['4-2-168']
joey & rachel: you think? oh, no, he's right.:::['4-2-169']
hi. group: hi. hey.:::['4-2-170']
uh, pheebs, ahem...:::['4-2-171']

my mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred.:::['4-2-175']
huh? what'd you say, joe? i'll be right there.:::['4-2-178']
pheebs... i just feel so...:::['4-2-179']

what? oh, yeah, i got in there myself once.:::['4-2-194']
my roommate bet me 5 bucks that i couldn't.:::['4-2-195']
and then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.:::['4-2-196']
ha, ha. yeah.:::['4-2-197', '3-1-239']
it was funny till i started feeling like i was in a coffin.:::['4-2-198']
no, you... you can't fit in that thing. that's not deep enough.:::['4-2-199']
if i can't......i'll knock 5 bucks off the price:::['4-2-201']

oh, man, he promised he wouldn't take the chairs.:::['4-2-231']
what the hell happened? how were you locked in there? where the hell is all of our stuff?:::['4-2-232']
well, this guy came by to look at the unit......and he said he didn't think:::['4-2-233']
i was trying to make a sale.:::['4-2-236']
oh, man. if i ever run into that guy again, you know what i'm gonna do?:::['4-2-237']
and then zana just let one rip.:::['4-2-239']
look, not that i don't enjoy talking about people who we went to high school with......because i do.:::['4-2-240']
chip: ha, ha.:::['4-2-241']
but, um, maybe we can talk about something else.:::['4-2-242']
like you. i don't even know where you work.:::['4-2-243']
you know where i work. i do?:::['4-2-244']
the movie theater. you used to come in all the time.:::['4-2-245']
you still work at the multiplex? like i'd give up that job. ha, ha.:::['4-2-246']
free popcorn and candy any time i want?:::['4-2-247']
i can get you free posters for your room. thanks, i'm set.:::['4-2-248']
do you live with your parents? yeah, but i can stay out as late as i want.:::['4-2-249']
wow, they really got you guys. your tv, the chairs.:::['4-2-250']
yeah, your microwave, the stereo.:::['4-2-251']
oh, man, he took the five of spades.:::['4-2-252']
oh, no, no, here it is.:::['4-2-253']
oh. um, joey was born, and then 28 years later, i was robbed.:::['4-2-255']
so how was your date?:::['4-2-256']
well, you know how i always wanted to go out with chip in high school?:::['4-2-257']
well, tonight, i actually went out with chip matthews in high school.:::['4-2-258']
no, it's okay. not only did i get to go out with chip matthews......i got to dump chip matthews.:::['4-2-260']
oh, that's so great. i know.:::['4-2-261']
so, uh, what did the insurance company say?:::['4-2-263']
oh, they said, uh: "you don't have insurance here, so stop calling us.":::['4-2-264']
you didn't tell her?:::['4-2-265']
pheebs? yeah. hi.:::['4-2-267']
hi. listen, uh......this cat belongs to a little girl.:::['4-2-268']
all right? there are flyers all over the place.:::['4-2-269']
i'm sorry, sweetie.:::['4-2-270']
hey, we can take her back with you if you want.:::['4-2-271']
but, you know, she chose to find me.:::['4-2-273']
i mean, i have to respect her decision, right?:::['4-2-274']
that's a good call. that's right.:::['4-2-275']
no, no. hey, enough is enough.:::['4-2-276']
look, i'm sorry that you feel guilty or whatever......about spending time with your new mom.:::['4-2-277']
but this is not your old mom.:::['4-2-278']
this is a cat. okay?:::['4-2-279']
julio the cat.:::['4-2-280']
not mom. cat.:::['4-2-281']
ross, how many parents have you lost?:::['4-2-283']
none.:::['4-2-284']
okay, then you don't know what it feels like when one of them comes back. do you?:::['4-2-285']
i believe this is my mother.:::['4-2-286']
even if i'm wrong, who cares?:::['4-2-287']
just be a friend, okay? be supportive.:::['4-2-288']
i don't know what to say. heh.:::['4-2-291']
you could say you're sorry to her mom.:::['4-2-292']
i think she would like that.:::['4-2-293']
come here. here, come here, come here.:::['4-2-294']
mrs. buffay?:::['4-2-295']
sorry about what i said.:::['4-2-296']
um, it was insensitive of me to say......that you were just a cat.:::['4-2-297']
when, clearly, you are also the reincarnated spirit......of my friend's mother.:::['4-2-298']
we both forgive you. heh.:::['4-2-300']
what are you gonna do about the little girl?:::['4-2-301']
yeah. okay, listen.:::['4-2-302']
um, mom, i hope you know that you still mean a lot to me.:::['4-2-303']
and you're welcome to come back any time.:::['4-2-304']
if she could come back as a couch, we'd really appreciate it.:::['4-2-306']
come on, mom, i'm gonna take you home.:::['4-2-307']
i'll go with you. monica: me too.:::['4-2-308']
oh, uh, you know, i got an extra futon.:::['4-2-309']
dude, you don't have to brag. we got nothing here.:::['4-2-310']
hey. we are so in luck.:::['4-3-0']
treeger said we could have all this cool stuff from the basement.:::['4-3-1']
wait right there.:::['4-3-2']
oh, no, no. i'm paddling away.:::['4-3-3']
wow. really? we got all this rusty crap for free?:::['4-3-5']
uh-huh. this and a bunch of bubble wrap... ...and some of it is not even popped.:::['4-3-6']
could we be more white trash?:::['4-3-7']
how desperate am i?:::['4-3-8']
oh, good thing chandler's not here. he always wins at this game.:::['4-3-9']
i just told my mom i'd cater her party for her.:::['4-3-10']
how come? because i need the money.:::['4-3-11']
and i thought it'd be a great way to get rid of that last little smidgen of self-respect.:::['4-3-12']
come on, i think this is a good thing.:::['4-3-13']
i don't think mom would've hired you......if she didn't think you were good:::['4-3-14']
at what you do.:::['4-3-15']
you don't have to stick up for her. she can't hear you.:::['4-3-16']
hey, um, do you guys have any juice?:::['4-3-17']
just pickle.:::['4-3-18']
hey, uh, rach. funny story. i bumped into joanna on the street yesterday.:::['4-3-19']
my boss, joanna? wow, that must have been awkward.:::['4-3-20']
well, no. actually, she asked me if i wanted to get a drink.:::['4-3-21']
you, uh, didn't say yes to that, did you?:::['4-3-22']
ha, ha. no. no.:::['4-3-23']
well, not at first.:::['4-3-25']
what is she doing here?:::['4-3-26']
of squeaking bed]:::['4-3-27', '4-3-30', '4-3-34']
i don't understand. last time you went out with her, you said she was a dud.:::['4-3-28']
i think i judged her too quickly. and this time, we were able to take the relationship to the next level.:::['4-3-29']
well, last time, i almost got fired. you must end it. you must end it now.:::['4-3-31']
it's not like this is an everyday occurrence for me.:::['4-3-32']
i mean, usually i'm pretty much in there by myself.:::['4-3-33']
promise me you will end it.:::['4-3-36']
okay. i promise i'll end it. thank you.:::['4-3-37']
but i hope you know what i'm giving up for you.:::['4-3-38']
because she's not just the boss in your office. you know what i mean?:::['4-3-39']
oh, sorry. i knew what he meant.:::['4-3-41']
how's the hired help?:::['4-3-42']
doing great. quiches are coming along.:::['4-3-43']
what's this? blue nail polish?:::['4-3-44']
yeah, i thought it was cute.:::['4-3-45']
ha. it's what your grandmother's hands looked like when we found her.:::['4-3-46']
let me ask you a question.:::['4-3-47']
why did you hire me?:::['4-3-48']
oh, well, richard raved about the food at his party......of course, you were sleeping with him.:::['4-3-49']
then i heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice.:::['4-3-50']
i assume you weren't sleeping with anyone there.:::['4-3-51']
though, at least that would be something.:::['4-3-52']
oh, my god. did you hear that?:::['4-3-53']
she hired me because she thinks i'm good.:::['4-3-54']
okay, i didn't hear that.:::['4-3-55']
yeah. she didn't hire me out of pity.:::['4-3-56']
it wasn't so she could pick on me in front of her friends. she actually thinks i'm good.:::['4-3-57']
wow. and hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian. ha, ha.:::['4-3-58']
good afternoon. are you the decision-maker of the house?:::['4-3-59']
do you, uh, currently own a set of encyclopedias?:::['4-3-61']
no, no, but, uh, try the classifieds. people sell everything in there.:::['4-3-62']
actually, i'm not buying. i'm selling.:::['4-3-63']
let me ask you one question.:::['4-3-64']
do your friends ever have a conversation......and you just nod along......even though you're not really sure:::['4-3-65']
what they're talking about?:::['4-3-66']
i'm telling you, it's totally unconstitutional.:::['4-3-67']
i hear you. yeah it is. i totally agree.:::['4-3-68']
i think he deserves a nobel prize.:::['4-3-69']
group: no.:::['4-3-70', '3-25-128']
it was like the algonquin kids' table.:::['4-3-71']
excuse me. i'm sorry.:::['4-3-72', '3-22-79']
you haven't said anything for about two and a half minutes.:::['4-3-73']
are you at all interested?:::['4-3-74']
yeah. yeah. yeah, oh, yeah. come on in. come on.:::['4-3-75']
that's weird. what?:::['4-3-76']
your nails. oh, i know. i never wear fake ones.:::['4-3-77']
i just did it so my mom wouldn't give me grief about biting them.:::['4-3-78']
no, i meant it's weird that you only have nine now.:::['4-3-79']
i had them when i put...:::['4-3-82']
oh, my god. it's in the quiche.:::['4-3-83']
oh, my god. okay, don't panic.:::['4-3-84']
i'm gonna go to the store, get you another set of nails.:::['4-3-85']
no one is gonna know, and you're gonna look great.:::['4-3-86']
oh. oh, it's because they're gonna eat... that's the problem.:::['4-3-87']
honey, don't bite your nails.:::['4-3-88']
okay, uh, please don't freak out.:::['4-3-89']
um, but there's a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups.:::['4-3-90']
and there's no way to know which one.:::['4-3-91']
and whoever finds it wins the prize.:::['4-3-92']
ha, ha. i'm not freaking out.:::['4-3-93']
why are you laughing? it's nothing. it's just that now your father owes me $5.:::['4-3-94']
ha, ha. what, you bet i'd lose a nail?:::['4-3-95']
oh, no, don't be silly. i just bet that i'd need these.:::['4-3-96']
monica: frozen lasagnas? mm.:::['4-3-97']
you bet that i'd screw up?:::['4-3-98']
so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was...:::['4-3-99']
no, that was all true.:::['4-3-100']
this was just in case you pulled a monica.:::['4-3-101']
you promised dr. weinberg you'd never use that phrase.:::['4-3-102']
honey, come on. have a sense of humor.:::['4-3-103']
you're never able to laugh at yourself.:::['4-3-104']
that's right. ha, ha.:::['4-3-105']
my mom doesn't have any faith in me. oh, that's hilarious.:::['4-3-106']
no. i have faith.:::['4-3-108']
no. you have lasagnas.:::['4-3-109']
oh, the ruined quiches are ready.:::['4-3-110']
it just doesn't feel like we're breaking up.:::['4-3-111']
no, we are. i'm sad.:::['4-3-112']
uh, can you wait till tomorrow? all right.:::['4-3-115']
no, no. that was my boss. i have to go.:::['4-3-118']
i'm getting dressed. why?:::['4-3-121']
when i walk outside naked, people throw garbage at me.:::['4-3-122']
wait. i want to show you something.:::['4-3-123']
just a little gag gift somebody gave me.:::['4-3-125']
put your hands together.:::['4-3-126', '3-3-152']
you're not the boss of me.:::['4-3-127']
hmm. saucy.:::['4-3-129']
i'll be back in two minutes.:::['4-3-130']
you're, uh...? you're going to leave me like this?:::['4-3-131']
knowing you're here waiting for me, i think that's kind of exciting, don't you?:::['4-3-132']
okay, but if you don't come back soon......there's pretty much nothing:::['4-3-133']
i can do about it.:::['4-3-134']
oh. hi. i brought you back a macaroon.:::['4-3-135']
oh, great. i'll keep it in my butt with your nose.:::['4-3-136']
that's weird. she locked the door.:::['4-3-137']
you know why? she's got the christmas bonus list in there.:::['4-3-138']
i saw her working on it this morning.:::['4-3-139']
okay, swear you won't tell.:::['4-3-140']
but when mark left, he gave me a key to joanna's office.:::['4-3-141']
you want to see the list? sophie: yeah.:::['4-3-142']
hello, joanna...:::['4-3-145']
's office.:::['4-3-146']
i'm sorry. i may be a little longer.:::['4-3-147']
how little? a couple hours. i feel awful.:::['4-3-148']
look, this isn't funny. you get back here now.:::['4-3-149']
i can't. why not?:::['4-3-150']
i'm in my boss' car.:::['4-3-151']
what? uh-oh, tunnel.:::['4-3-152']
rachel, could i see you for a moment?:::['4-3-154']
okay, here's the situation. ahem.:::['4-3-155']
the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door.:::['4-3-156']
could you be a doll......and grab them and scoot on over here:::['4-3-157']
and unlock me?:::['4-3-158']
and on a totally separate subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.:::['4-3-159']
you promised you would break up with her.:::['4-3-160']
i did break up with her. she just took it really, really well.:::['4-3-161']
and the fact that you were jeopardizing my career never entered your mind?:::['4-3-162']
it did enter my mind.:::['4-3-163']
but then something happened that made it shoot right out.:::['4-3-164']
you know what, chandler? you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out them.:::['4-3-165']
no, no, no. i can't get myself right out of them.:::['4-3-166']
you must have me confused with the amazing chandler.:::['4-3-167']
come on, you have to unlock me. she could be gone for hours, and i'm cold and...:::['4-3-168']
ugh! chandler. all right. this is it.:::['4-3-169']
you never see joanna again.:::['4-3-170']
never.:::['4-3-171']
you never come into this office again. fine.:::['4-3-172']
you give me back my walkman. i...:::['4-3-173']
i never borrowed your walkman.:::['4-3-174']
well, then i lost it. you buy me one.:::['4-3-175']
you got it. here we go. come on. this is great.:::['4-3-176']
aw. does it hurt?:::['4-3-177']
no, i just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off.:::['4-3-178']
hello, sweet pants.:::['4-3-179']
wait a minute. what are you gonna tell joanna?:::['4-3-180']
when she sees that you're gone, she's gonna know i let you out and i'm gonna get fired.:::['4-3-182']
i'll make something up. i'm good at lying.:::['4-3-183']
i actually did borrow your walkman.:::['4-3-184']
no, there's nothing to make up. she's gonna know i have a key to her office.:::['4-3-185']
i've gotta get you locked back the way you were.:::['4-3-186']
well, this is much better.:::['4-3-188']
so here's somebody interesting, joey.:::['4-3-189']
what do you know about van gogh?:::['4-3-190']
uh, he cut off his ear. and?:::['4-3-191']
he painted that.:::['4-3-193']
wow. that's pretty nice.:::['4-3-194']
i thought he cut off his ear because he sucked.:::['4-3-195']
what else you got in there? let's see, uh...:::['4-3-196']
where does the pope live? in the woods.:::['4-3-197']
wait, wait, that's the joke answer.:::['4-3-198']
actually, it's vatican city.:::['4-3-199']
now, uh, what do you know about, uh, vulcanized rubber?:::['4-3-200']
spock's birth control.:::['4-3-201']
you need these books.:::['4-3-202']
this used to be your room?:::['4-3-204']
wow. oh, you must have been in really good shape as a kid.:::['4-3-205']
oh, i'm such an idiot.:::['4-3-206']
i can't believe i actually thought she could change.:::['4-3-207']
look, who cares what your mom thinks?:::['4-3-208']
so you pulled a monica.:::['4-3-209']
oh, good. i'm glad that's catching on.:::['4-3-210']
why does that have to be a bad thing? just change what it means.:::['4-3-211']
you know, go down there and prove your mother wrong.:::['4-3-212']
you finish the job you were hired to do and we'll call that "pulling a monica.":::['4-3-213']
okay, um, if a kid gets straight a's, his parents would say: "yeah, you pulled a monica." ha, ha.:::['4-3-215']
oh, or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "yeah, no, he pulled a monica.":::['4-3-216']
or someone hits a home run, and the announcer says: "yeah, that one's out of here.":::['4-3-217']
because some things don't change.:::['4-3-218']
all right. i'll go down there.:::['4-3-219']
but i'm not gonna serve the lasagna. i'm gonna serve something that i make.:::['4-3-220']
oh! wow.:::['4-3-223']
wow, my breasts are really strong.:::['4-3-224']
chandler, please. i have to get you locked up back the way you were.:::['4-3-226']
i'm so going to lose my job.:::['4-3-227']
she's very private about her office.:::['4-3-228']
now i know why.:::['4-3-229']
hey, look. you're in trouble either way, okay?:::['4-3-230']
if she comes and sees me locked to this instead of the chair......she's gonna know you were in here.:::['4-3-231']
so you might as well just let me go.:::['4-3-232']
i'll clean your bathroom for a month. still wouldn't be clean.:::['4-3-233']
all i want is my freedom.:::['4-3-234']
foot rubs for a month. freedom.:::['4-3-235']
i'll take all your photos and put them into albums.:::['4-3-236']
freedom. i want my freedom.:::['4-3-237']
why won't you hear me? sophie, help me.:::['4-3-238']
help me. sophie, sit.:::['4-3-239']
god, would you just calm down?:::['4-3-240']
i'm going to say this for the last time.:::['4-3-241']
would you please just...?:::['4-3-242']
wow, there's a lot i didn't know about vomit.:::['4-3-243']
in a minute.:::['4-3-244']
so, what do you say, joey?:::['4-3-245']
you get the whole set of encyclopedias for $1200.:::['4-3-246']
that works out to just 50 bucks a book.:::['4-3-247']
twelve hundred dollars?:::['4-3-248']
you think i have $1200?:::['4-3-249']
i'm home in the middle of the day......and i got patio furniture:::['4-3-250']
in my living room.:::['4-3-251']
i guess there's a few things you don't get from book learning.:::['4-3-252']
well, uh, what can you swing?:::['4-3-253']
how about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?:::['4-3-254']
you don't have anything?:::['4-3-255']
you want to see what i got? okay.:::['4-3-256']
i got a baby tootsie roll......a movie stub, keys, a kleenex......a rock......and an army man.:::['4-3-257']
okay, i get the picture. uh, thanks for your time.:::['4-3-258']
and a fifty.:::['4-3-259']
huh. these must be chandler's pants.:::['4-3-260']
for 50 bucks you can get one book.:::['4-3-261']
what will it be? a? b? c?:::['4-3-262']
i think i'm gonna stick with the v.:::['4-3-263']
i want to see how this bad boy turns out. heh.:::['4-3-264']
i, uh, will buy and wrap all of your christmas gifts. no. oh.:::['4-3-265']
i, uh... oh, i'll squeeze you fresh orange juice every morning.:::['4-3-266']
with extra pulp? yeah.:::['4-3-267']
i've got it.:::['4-3-269']
you don't have it.:::['4-3-270']
i have so got it.:::['4-3-271']
there's gonna be rumors about this. there's no way to stop it.:::['4-3-272']
sophie knows, monica and phoebe know.:::['4-3-273']
how do monica and phoebe know? oh, i called them.:::['4-3-274']
when they ask me what i saw......i can be very generous......or very stingy.:::['4-3-275']
go on. i can make you a legend.:::['4-3-276']
i can make you this generation's milton berle.:::['4-3-277']
and milton berle has... oh. not compared to you.:::['4-3-278']
well? they're not even touching the lasagna.:::['4-3-279']
really? oh, they love your casserole.:::['4-3-280']
yes. it's hard to believe, just a little while ago, this was nothing but ingredients.:::['4-3-281']
everyone seems to like your dish.:::['4-3-282']
and you?:::['4-3-283']
i thought it was......quite tasty.:::['4-3-284']
so if everyone liked it, and you liked it......that would make this a success.:::['4-3-285']
which would make you...:::['4-3-286']
a bitch?:::['4-3-287']
well, i was going for "wrong," but we can use your word.:::['4-3-288']
yes, well, i was wrong.:::['4-3-289']
and i have to say......you really impressed me today.:::['4-3-290']
um, you might even say that she pulled a monica.:::['4-3-292']
she doesn't know we switched it.:::['4-3-293']
and the next time you cater for me......there will be nothing but ice:::['4-3-294']
in the freezer.:::['4-3-295']
well, that really means a lot.:::['4-3-296']
oh, mom, don't bite your nails.:::['4-3-297']
hello. group: hey.:::['4-3-298']
hello, chandler.:::['4-3-299', '3-9-126']
no, he doesn't.:::['4-3-303']
two hours, that lasted.:::['4-3-304']
so did you break up with joanna?:::['4-3-305']
well, it's a good thing you got out when you did, before she blew up like vesuvius.:::['4-3-307']
the volcano? joey: yeah.:::['4-3-308']
and speaking of volcanoes, man, are they a violent, igneous-rock formation.:::['4-3-309']
oh, yeah. lava spewing, hot ash.:::['4-3-311']
of course, some are dormant.:::['4-3-312']
why are you talking about volcanoes all of a sudden?:::['4-3-313']
oh, we can talk about something else.:::['4-3-314']
what do you want to talk about? vivisection?:::['4-3-315']
the vas deferens?:::['4-3-316']
the vietnam war?:::['4-3-317']
oh, did anybody see that documentary on the korean war?:::['4-3-318']
group: oh, yeah.:::['4-3-319']
oh, god, korea's such a beautiful country.:::['4-3-320']
with such a sad history. phoebe: yeah.:::['4-3-321']
could there be more kims?:::['4-3-322']
joanna: who's out there? it's me. good morning.:::['4-3-323']
joanna: rachel, could you come in here a moment?:::['4-3-324']
yeah, sure. um, they didn't have poppy-seed bagels......so i have sesame ones... oh, my word.:::['4-3-325']
i seem to have had a slight office mishap.:::['4-3-327']
could you get the key off the back of the door? yeah, sure. i...:::['4-3-328']
tell your friend chandler that we're definitely broken up this time.:::['4-3-330']
oh, nothing. it's an acting exercise. i'm practicing my fake laugh.:::['3-18-1']
what? what's so funny?:::['3-18-3']
gunther: oh, no, no.:::['3-18-4']
no, no. there's none of that in here.:::['3-18-5']
oh, come on. at least let me finish this last one.:::['3-18-6']
okay, but only if you give me a drag.:::['3-18-7']
oh, dark mother, once again i suckle at your smoky teat.:::['3-18-9']
why don't you hold on to that one.:::['3-18-10']
that's, like, the least fun game ever.:::['3-18-11']
i'm sick of your smoking, so i brought something......that is going to help you quit.:::['3-18-12']
that patch is no good.:::['3-18-14']
it's a hypnosis tape.:::['3-18-15']
a woman at work used it for two weeks and hasn't smoked since.:::['3-18-16']
what's your problem?:::['3-18-18']
nothing. it's just that hypnosis is beyond crap.:::['3-18-19']
i watched you get hypnotized in atlantic city.:::['3-18-20']
that guy did not hypnotize me, okay?:::['3-18-21']
you always pull your pants down and play "wipe out" on your butt.:::['3-18-22']
forget hypnosis.:::['3-18-23']
the way to quit smoking is to dance naked in a field of heather......and then bathe in the sweat:::['3-18-24']
of six healthy young men.:::['3-18-25']
or what my father calls "thursday night.":::['3-18-26']
here you go. i didn't want cinnamon on this.:::['3-18-27']
hi. hi. oh, my god! frank!:::['3-18-29']
ha, ha. hi. how are you? what are you doing here?:::['3-18-30']
i would've called, but i lost your number.:::['3-18-31']
and then, uh, my mom locked me out of the house, so i couldn't find it.:::['3-18-32']
and, uh, then i tried to find a pay phone,and the receiver was cut off.:::['3-18-33']
uh, oh. vandalism.:::['3-18-35']
but also, what happened between you and your mom?:::['3-18-36']
we got in a fight. she said that i was too immature to get married.:::['3-18-37']
you're getting married? oh, yeah.:::['3-18-38']
my little brother's getting married! ha, ha.:::['3-18-40']
i knew you'd be so cool about this. uh, hey, do you wanna meet her?:::['3-18-41']
cool, all right. she's just parking the truck.:::['3-18-45']
i'm gonna... i'm gonna go get my, uh, fiancée, man!:::['3-18-46']
i'd have bet good money that he'd be the first one of us to get married.:::['3-18-47']
isn't it fantastic?:::['3-18-48']
yeah, but don't you think he's a little young to get married?:::['3-18-49']
what? he's 18. it'll be illegal for him to drink......at his own bachelor party.:::['3-18-50']
yeah, or to get a hooker.:::['3-18-51']
always illegal, joe.:::['3-18-52']
frank: hey! hey!:::['3-18-53']
this is, uh, my fiancée......mrs. knight.:::['3-18-54']
you know, it's funny.:::['3-18-56']
frank told me so much about you, but you're not how i pictured you at all.:::['3-18-57']
yeah, i'm a big surprise.:::['3-18-58']
here you go. here, grab a seat. oh.:::['3-18-59']
so how did you guys meet?:::['3-18-60']
well, um, i was in mrs. knight's...:::['3-18-61']
i mean, alice. sorry. i always do that. ha, ha.:::['3-18-62']
i was in her home ec class.:::['3-18-63']
he was my best student.:::['3-18-64']
she was my best teacher.:::['3-18-65']
if that doesn't keep kids in school, what will?:::['3-18-67']
and so now you guys are gonna be married?:::['3-18-68']
we talked about just living together, but, um......we wanna have kids right away.:::['3-18-70']
great!:::['3-18-72']
wow, kids. frank, are you sure you're ready for that?:::['3-18-73']
how hard can it be?:::['3-18-74']
you know, i mean, you know, babies. who doesn't want babies? right?:::['3-18-75']
and besides, i never had a dad around.:::['3-18-76']
and now i always will, because it'll be me.:::['3-18-77']
really, we do realize that there's an age difference between us.:::['3-18-78']
good. because you were acting like you didn't.:::['3-18-79']
but when it comes to love, what does age matter?:::['3-18-80']
you are falling fast asleep.:::['3-18-81']
deeper, deeper, deeper.:::['3-18-82']
you are now completely asleep.:::['3-18-83']
you don't need to smoke.:::['3-18-84', '3-18-294']
cigarettes don't control you.:::['3-18-85', '3-18-295', '3-18-324']
you are a strong, confident woman......who does not need to smoke.:::['3-18-86', '3-18-296', '3-18-325']
a strong, confident woman.:::['3-18-87']
you know what? i realized in the last year i've only gone out with richard and julio.:::['3-18-88']
you gotta help me out. set me up. get me back in the game.:::['3-18-89']
shouldn't be a problem. i work in fashion, and all i meet are eligible straight men.:::['3-18-90']
can i get you something else?:::['3-18-91']
cheesecake and a date, if you're giving them out.:::['3-18-92']
heh. haven't we covered that topic?:::['3-18-93']
you just said to her... you wanna go out with me......because of my wig, the big boobs,and i serve you food.:::['3-18-94']
if that were true, i'd be dating my aunt ruth.:::['3-18-95']
and the two times we went out, it was plain awkward.:::['3-18-96']
you think she should go out with me, don't you?:::['3-18-97']
well, i mean......are you sure:::['3-18-99']
you wanna go out with her?:::['3-18-100']
that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, know what i mean?:::['3-18-101']
that wig all in disarray, and boobs flung over the nightstand.:::['3-18-102']
really. think about it.:::['3-18-103']
oh, i will. ha-ha-ha.:::['3-18-104']
no, i know. i know that this is frank's life.:::['3-18-105']
i don't wanna be judgmental, but it's sick. it's sick and wrong!:::['3-18-107']
what, is it the age thing?:::['3-18-108']
no, i'm fine with the age thing......until it sticks its tongue:::['3-18-109']
down my brother's throat.:::['3-18-110']
pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.:::['3-18-111']
you think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers......of all the babies:::['3-18-112']
they have to have right away?:::['3-18-113']
this is not fair to frank, and it's not fair to the babies.:::['3-18-114']
you know what? it's not good home economics.:::['3-18-115']
have you told him how you feel?:::['3-18-116']
yes. not out loud.:::['3-18-117']
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.:::['3-18-118']
yeah, but if i do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.:::['3-18-119']
look at him and his mom. i can't.:::['3-18-120']
but you guys can. you talk him out of it.:::['3-18-121']
you have nothing to lose. i have everything to lose.:::['3-18-124']
do you want me to lose everything? everything?:::['3-18-125']
okay, i'm gonna go get frank.:::['3-18-127']
we're walking down the street, and i turn to you and say::::['3-18-128']
"let's go hang out at totally nude nudes." remember?:::['3-18-129']
and then, heh, you say, "let's just hang out at your place.":::['3-18-130']
well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.:::['3-18-131']
i think you should go out with this guy.:::['3-18-132']
no, he doesn't do anything for me.:::['3-18-133']
last saturday night, what happened on walker, texas ranger?:::['3-18-134']
well, um, walker was looking for this big busload of kids. heh.:::['3-18-135']
all right, i get your point.:::['3-18-136']
i forgot the combination to this about a year ago.:::['3-18-138']
i just carry it around.:::['3-18-139']
you got any chap stick? uh, yeah.:::['3-18-140']
hey, how are those tapes working out?:::['3-18-141']
pretty good. good. i haven't smoked yet today.:::['3-18-142']
i feel great and confident. that is a stunning blouse.:::['3-18-143']
okay, mon. let's give pete a chance. he was funny. he seems really nice.:::['3-18-146']
that check thing was adorable.:::['3-18-147']
what check thing?:::['3-18-148']
as a joke, this customer who has a crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.:::['3-18-149']
his number's on the check. he did it so i'd call.:::['3-18-150']
pete becker. pete...:::['3-18-151']
is this him?:::['3-18-152']
that's bill clinton.:::['3-18-153']
who's he hugging?:::['3-18-154']
oh, my god. that's pete. why is bill hugging pete?:::['3-18-155']
this guy invented moss 865.:::['3-18-156']
every office in the world uses that program.:::['3-18-157']
we use it! there you go!:::['3-18-158']
oh, my god. monica's gonna go out with a millionaire.:::['3-18-159']
no, i'm not gonna go out with him. oh, my god.:::['3-18-160']
i can't believe this is a real $20,000 check. this is so exciting.:::['3-18-161']
or incredibly offensive.:::['3-18-162']
yeah, sure. that too.:::['3-18-163']
all we're saying is, don't rush into anything.:::['3-18-165']
come on, think about it. you're 18, okay? she's 44.:::['3-18-166']
when you're 36, she's gonna be 88.:::['3-18-167']
look, the point is......there's a lot of women:::['3-18-169']
you haven't had sex with yet.:::['3-18-170']
yeah, he's right. he's right. this is your time, you know?:::['3-18-171']
you're young. you're weird. chicks dig that.:::['3-18-172']
but isn't sex better when it's with one person that you really care about?:::['3-18-173']
yeah, in a poem, maybe.:::['3-18-174']
no, the man's right. that's what i had with rachel.:::['3-18-175']
you don't have it anymore?:::['3-18-176']
no, i, uh... i slept with someone else.:::['3-18-177']
so wait. so how did that make things better?:::['3-18-178']
it didn't.:::['3-18-179']
what you used to have with rachel is what i got with alice.:::['3-18-180']
now what is that like?:::['3-18-181']
it's so cool, man.:::['3-18-182']
it's because being with her is so much better than not being with her.:::['3-18-183']
why can't i find that? i had it and i blew it.:::['3-18-185']
well, i want it! you can have it.:::['3-18-186']
maybe i can't. maybe there's something wrong with me.:::['3-18-187']
no, it's out there, man. i've seen it! i got it!:::['3-18-188']
then you hold on to it! all right, man!:::['3-18-189']
all right! congratulations, you lucky bastard!:::['3-18-190']
you're frank's best man?:::['3-18-191']
i couldn't help it. their love is so pure.:::['3-18-192']
what about you, huh?:::['3-18-193']
i'm the ring bearer.:::['3-18-194']
hi! oh, alice, hi. thanks.:::['3-18-195']
i'm so glad you could come. i've got a real, um, home ec emergency.:::['3-18-196']
oh, my god. who died on this? yeah, i know.:::['3-18-197']
it's a real "mustard-tastrophe.":::['3-18-198']
can you help me? absolutely.:::['3-18-199']
okay, first, we'll start with a little club soda and salt.:::['3-18-200']
then if that doesn't work... you know what? forget it. it's ruined.:::['3-18-201']
oh, no, never say that. if you can't get it out, cut around the stain......add a little lace,you make a stylish throw.:::['3-18-202']
or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, frank?:::['3-18-203']
can we make it smaller? make it fit on the head of a pin?:::['3-18-204']
i love when we make things fit on the head of a pin.:::['3-18-205']
got it, yeah. yeah, okay.:::['3-18-206']
receptionist: you have monica geller here.:::['3-18-207']
uh, absolutely. yeah, send her in.:::['3-18-208']
pete: hi.:::['3-18-209']
hang on for a sec. i'll talk to you in the morning?:::['3-18-211']
i'm sorry. what? what's this supposed to mean?:::['3-18-213']
well, you know, i never know how much to tip.:::['3-18-214']
you double the tax. not double the tax of romania.:::['3-18-215']
i mean, what's the deal? are you trying to buy me?:::['3-18-216']
is this the way you get girls to go out with you?:::['3-18-217']
uh, i'm still here.:::['3-18-218']
you're taking this wrong. if i didn't leave you that tip......you wouldn't have come,we wouldn't have this argument......and there wouldn't be this,uh, heat between us.:::['3-18-219']
what? come on.:::['3-18-220']
you gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.:::['3-18-221']
you were the chef, and i was the customer.:::['3-18-222']
but now we're this couple that fights.:::['3-18-223']
okay, um......you're a loon.:::['3-18-224']
look, forget the check, okay? i like you.:::['3-18-225']
i think you're great.:::['3-18-226']
come on, what do you say?:::['3-18-227']
i don't wanna encourage this behavior.:::['3-18-230']
one meal. that's all i'm asking for. please?:::['3-18-231']
we go out, we eat.:::['3-18-232']
if you don't have a good time, i'll give you 10 grand, we're even.:::['3-18-233']
frank: hi. aah! no!:::['3-18-234']
wait, no. just put the mail down. it's me.:::['3-18-235']
sorry. why were you just all in the dark?:::['3-18-236']
well, um, your laundry smelled so good that i thought i'd curl up in it.:::['3-18-237']
is that all right? yeah, sure.:::['3-18-238']
it's just probably the worst one since i've been alive.:::['3-18-240']
what, um...? what happened?:::['3-18-241']
um, alice, uh...:::['3-18-242']
she, uh, called it off.:::['3-18-243']
did, um... did she say why?:::['3-18-245']
uh, no, not really. just that i was too young.:::['3-18-246']
i don't see how i could suddenly be too young......because i'm older than i was:::['3-18-247']
when we first got together.:::['3-18-248']
yeah, yeah, no, i don't...:::['3-18-249']
i don't know. but you know what? maybe it's just all for the best.:::['3-18-250']
well, yeah, if the best is like unbelievable pain.:::['3-18-251']
you know, i was just finally happy.:::['3-18-253']
for the first time in my life......after my dad left me......and then getting arrested:::['3-18-254']
for stealing those birds......and then the whole:::['3-18-255']
punctured-lung thing.:::['3-18-256']
it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather......but with alice,all that stuff kind of went away.:::['3-18-257']
and now it's gone, and i don't know why.:::['3-18-258']
ugh. well, i can tell you why. it's because of me.:::['3-18-259']
but you know what? i only did it because i love you, okay?:::['3-18-260']
what? um, i kind of had a little chat with alice......and i sort of made her see:::['3-18-261']
why you two shouldn't be together.:::['3-18-262']
and you'll see it too, one day. you really, really will.:::['3-18-263']
wait a minute. this is because of you?:::['3-18-264']
wait, no. my mother didn't want us to be together......but the worst thing she did:::['3-18-266']
was tie me to the porch.:::['3-18-267']
okay, but...:::['3-18-268']
i came to you because i thought you'd understand.:::['3-18-269']
no... ugh.:::['3-18-271']
i would storm out of here......if i had some money:::['3-18-272']
or a place to go.:::['3-18-273']
oh, my god! the millionaire's here!:::['3-18-274']
guys, please. i'm just gonna have dinner with him.:::['3-18-276']
okay, just because he buys you dinner does not mean you owe him anything.:::['3-18-277']
okay, then get the lobster.:::['3-18-279']
monica: hey. hi.:::['3-18-280']
hey, how much cash you got in your pocket right now?:::['3-18-283']
and that's why i'm not inviting you in for a drink. bye.:::['3-18-284']
rachel: why not? hey, come in for drink.:::['3-18-285']
where do you wanna go? you like pizza?:::['3-18-286']
oh, that sounds great. i know a great little place.:::['3-18-287']
you're not paying for the pizza.:::['3-18-288']
come on, it's only fair. you paid for the flight.:::['3-18-289']
is that enough lira?:::['3-18-290']
uh, i'd throw another 1000 on that.:::['3-18-291']
how much is that? that's about 60 cents.:::['3-18-292']
every night!:::['3-18-293']
a strong, confident woman......who does not need to smoke.:::['3-18-297']
so can i.:::['3-18-298']
phoebe: hey, frank.:::['3-18-299']
look, i know that you think i did this totally evil thing.:::['3-18-300']
but i so didn't.:::['3-18-301']
someone's here who can explain this better than i can.:::['3-18-302']
we can go look.:::['3-18-303']
hi, frank.:::['3-18-304']
hi, mrs. knight.:::['3-18-305']
phoebe's right, frank.:::['3-18-306']
it's hard to hear, but it would've been wrong to go through with it.:::['3-18-307']
i was being selfish.:::['3-18-308']
even though we want the same things right now......in the future, we may not.:::['3-18-309']
is that what it is? yes, but not just that.:::['3-18-310']
right, not just that.:::['3-18-311']
even though we love each other as much as we do......nonetheless...:::['3-18-312']
nonetheless. nonetheless.:::['3-18-313']
you're too young......to really know what you want.:::['3-18-315']
that's right, exactly.:::['3-18-316']
that's a goodbye kiss. that's good.:::['3-18-317']
the important thing is, is that you see what i'm saying.:::['3-18-319']
this is clearly wrong.:::['3-18-320']
i've decided i'm gonna let this happen.:::['3-18-321']
okay, can i just get my purse?:::['3-18-322']
frank: mmm. okay, all right, good.:::['3-18-323']
joey's your best friend.:::['3-18-326']
you wanna make him a cheese sandwich every day.:::['3-18-327']
and you also wanna buy him hundreds of dollars worth of pants.:::['3-18-328']
do you think there's a town in missouri or someplace......called sample?:::['3-24-0']
and as you're driving into the town, there's a sign and it says::::['3-24-1']
"you're in sample.":::['3-24-2']
monica: hey. all: hey.:::['3-24-3']
rachel: how did it go with pete? ross: tell us.:::['3-24-4']
you're not gonna believe this. so i go...:::['3-24-5']
i'm sorry. excuse us.:::['3-24-6']
it's a little crowded. do you mind? could you skooch?:::['3-24-7']
tim: move over just a little bit.:::['3-24-8']
keep on skooching.:::['3-24-9']
so, guys, listen. i go over there and, you know, i'm...:::['3-24-11']
tomas: why? what is wrong with me?:::['3-24-12']
what's the matter? tim......i have a feeling......my wife is sleeping:::['3-24-13']
with her gynecologist.:::['3-24-14']
he's got access. i know.:::['3-24-16']
it's a feeling you get.:::['3-24-17']
like when you're in somebody else's bowling shoes?:::['3-24-18']
that's the one.:::['3-24-19']
so you went to pete's. what happened?:::['3-24-20']
tomas: why is this happening to me?:::['3-24-21']
maybe it's my wound.:::['3-24-22']
it's not healed yet?:::['3-24-24']
it's oozing!:::['3-24-25']
would you pass the cream? there's the cream.:::['3-24-26']
tomas, this is gonna be hard, but i wanted it to come from me.:::['3-24-28']
what is it? i've been sleeping with your wife.:::['3-24-29']
you're the gynecologist?:::['3-24-30']
i'm trying to have a private conversation.:::['3-24-31']
can i have a napkin? could you please hand me a napkin?:::['3-24-32']
just give me the thing, all right?:::['3-24-33']
and you are no longer my friend!:::['3-24-35']
we are finished! nada! no more!:::['3-24-36']
you are a bastard for doing that!:::['3-24-37']
stay away from me!:::['3-24-38']
tim: come back!:::['3-24-39']
so what were you gonna tell us?:::['3-24-40']
what was the big news pete wanted to tell you?:::['3-24-42']
or should i say, "mrs. monica becker"?:::['3-24-43']
oh, keep your name.don't take his name.:::['3-24-44']
he didn't ask me to marry him.:::['3-24-45']
all: aw. then definitely don't take his name!:::['3-24-46']
he wanted to tell me he's going to compete in some ultimate......fighting competition thingy.:::['3-24-47']
joey: pete? rachel: why? what is it?:::['3-24-48']
i don't know exactly. it's sort of like wrestling.:::['3-24-49']
oh? but without the costumes.:::['3-24-50']
and it's not fake. it's totally brutal.:::['3-24-52']
it's two guys in the ring and the rules are, "there are no rules"!:::['3-24-53']
you can bite and pull people's hair and stuff?:::['3-24-54']
anything goes except eye-gouging and fish-hooking.:::['3-24-55']
what's fish-hooking? what's fish-hook...:::['3-24-56']
thanks. that would have been hard to describe.:::['3-24-57']
what is that taste?:::['3-24-58']
my hands are totally clean. i just gave the duck a bath.:::['3-24-59']
doug: thanks for the warm welcome.:::['3-24-60']
it's good to have you guys on my team. i come to play. i hope you do too.:::['3-24-61']
let's go out there and get them! and remember::::['3-24-62']
there is no i in "team.":::['3-24-63']
yes, but there's two in "martini." so, everybody, back to my office.:::['3-24-64']
you! chuckles. what's your name?:::['3-24-65']
it's bing, sir. i'm sorry. i was just...:::['3-24-66']
no, no. i heard what you said. funny. i like funny.:::['3-24-67']
this team's about hard work, but it's also about having fun.:::['3-24-68']
good to have you aboard, bing!:::['3-24-69']
ross: that's right. ryder.:::['3-24-70']
winona ryder for six.:::['3-24-71']
yeah. we have the reservations. rachel: yes!:::['3-24-73']
all right, buddy! way to go!:::['3-24-74']
dude, what are you doing?:::['3-24-75']
thank you. my boss keeps slapping my butt and acting like it's no big deal.:::['3-24-76']
what'd you do about it?:::['3-24-77']
i didn't do anything. i didn't want to be the guy......who has a problem with his boss:::['3-24-78']
slapping his bottom.:::['3-24-79']
i gotta tell you, i think it's okay to be that guy.:::['3-24-80']
maybe it's that jock thing.:::['3-24-81']
you know, how football players pat each other after touchdowns.:::['3-24-82']
you know, i don't understand guys.:::['3-24-83']
i mean, i would never congratulate monica on a great stew......by, you know, grabbing her boob.:::['3-24-84']
i know. for a really great stew, you'd just......stick your head in between them.:::['3-24-85']
can we please go eat?:::['3-24-86']
yeah, what are we getting? anything but stew.:::['3-24-87']
so from now on, don't give your boss a chance to get you.:::['3-24-88']
don't turn your back to him.:::['3-24-89']
or you could teach him a lesson, you know?:::['3-24-90']
what you do is rub something that smells really bad on your butt, right?:::['3-24-91']
then when he goes to smack you, his hand will smell.:::['3-24-92']
now, what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad?:::['3-24-93']
what if joey was president?:::['3-24-94']
yeah. okay, you can totally say no......but would it be okay with you:::['3-24-96']
if i set ross up on a date?:::['3-24-97']
oh. uh, with who?:::['3-24-98']
my friend bonnie. she always thought ross was cute......and she asked if i could set it up.:::['3-24-99']
but if that's not cool... which one is bonnie?:::['3-24-100']
you remember her from my birthday party?:::['3-24-101']
average height......medium build, bald...:::['3-24-102']
great! okay! good for you! all right!:::['3-24-105']
you are iron! you are steel!:::['3-24-106']
let me ask you, how come when i call your computer support line......i have to wait an hour and a half?:::['3-24-107']
we're adding operators all the time. could we concentrate on my training?:::['3-24-108']
it's just hard when i know i have e-mail i can't get.:::['3-24-109']
hi. monica!:::['3-24-110']
on the table. on the table, please.:::['3-24-112']
hey, um, so listen, my friends were telling me a little bit about......this ultimate fighting thing.:::['3-24-113']
it sounds really dangerous.:::['3-24-114']
i don't want you to get hurt, because i kind of like you.:::['3-24-115']
i don't want to get hurt either. i'm being smart about this.:::['3-24-116']
see these guys? they're the best trainers in the world.:::['3-24-117']
hoshi was a paid assassin.:::['3-24-118']
a housepainter! he used to be a housepainter!:::['3-24-119']
promise me you'll be careful. i promise.:::['3-24-120']
are we still on for tonight? good. because......maybe we could have:::['3-24-121']
a little workout of our own.:::['3-24-122']
no! no boom-boom before big fight!:::['3-24-123']
how about just a boom?:::['3-24-124']
that was depressing. i just bought a pretzel......from one of the kids from fame.:::['3-24-125']
ready to go to the movies? mm-hm. oh, this is bonnie!:::['3-24-126']
this is bonnie?:::['3-24-128']
this is bonnie? you're bonnie?:::['3-24-129']
i can show you an i.d. if you want.:::['3-24-130']
oh, no. you look a lot different than the last time i saw you.:::['3-24-131']
oh, yeah. well, i just started wearing bras again.:::['3-24-132']
oh, that must be it.:::['3-24-133']
have fun tonight.:::['3-24-134']
thanks. you too.:::['3-24-135']
you said she was bald.:::['3-24-136']
she was bald. she's not now.:::['3-24-137']
how could you not tell me she has hair?:::['3-24-138']
i don't know. i hardly ever say that about people.:::['3-24-139']
oh, well this is just perfect!:::['3-24-140']
well, i'm sorry. i thought you said it was okay.:::['3-24-141']
i said it was okay when i thought she was some weird bald chick.:::['3-24-142']
that girl has got hair all over her head!:::['3-24-143']
maybe ross won't like her personality. does she have a bad personality?:::['3-24-144']
oh, no, bonnie's the best!:::['3-24-145']
read your computek proposal. real home run.:::['3-24-147']
ooh. barely got you that time. get over here!:::['3-24-148']
oh, yeah! good one.:::['3-24-150']
that was a good one. keep at it, team!:::['3-24-151']
what is with him? "with him"?:::['3-24-152']
you're his favorite. you're his guy!:::['3-24-153']
we never get smacked.:::['3-24-154']
that's not true. he smacked you once.:::['3-24-155']
not on purpose. he ricocheted off you and got me.:::['3-24-156']
i'm telling you, i need some smacks.:::['3-24-157']
i got a kid starting dartmouth.:::['3-24-158']
dartmouth? who went to dartmouth? dartmouth sucks!:::['3-24-159']
you go to dartmouth? no, sir.:::['3-24-160']
there you go! ha-ha-ha.:::['3-24-161']
god, ross! what is that?:::['3-24-163']
the ultimate fighting combo.:::['3-24-164']
i saved 30 cents. plus i get to keep the cup. yay!:::['3-24-165']
announcer: from new york city, new york......appearing in his ultimate:::['3-24-166']
fighting championship debut......he's known for his:::['3-24-167']
confrontational business style!:::['3-24-168']
ladies and gentlemen, introducing......pete becker!:::['3-24-169']
i love you, pete!:::['3-24-170']
and his opponent from huntington beach, california......he's a 300-pound:::['3-24-171']
street fighter......tank abbott!:::['3-24-172']
boo! boo!:::['3-24-173']
pete? pete?:::['3-24-174']
that guy's pretty huge. don't worry.:::['3-24-175']
i'll use his strength and weight against him.:::['3-24-176']
well, then that guy is in serious, serious trouble.:::['3-24-177']
you go get him. let's go!:::['3-24-178']
here we go, gentlemen.:::['3-24-179']
are you ready?:::['3-24-180']
are you ready? then let's get it on!:::['3-24-181']
uh-oh!:::['3-24-182']
can i just tell you how proud i am of you?:::['3-24-186']
it would be nice after hearing 20,000 people chant, "you suck!":::['3-24-187']
i thought you were nuts at first......but you did it.:::['3-24-188']
now you can just look back at this with no regrets.:::['3-24-189']
look back?:::['3-24-190']
you're not gonna keep going?:::['3-24-191']
let me ask you a question: am i the ultimate fighting champion?:::['3-24-192']
well, no. but...:::['3-24-193']
i'm not gonna stop until i'm the ultimate fighting champion.:::['3-24-194']
that guy stood on your neck until you passed out.:::['3-24-195']
let me tell you a story.:::['3-24-196']
when i set out to create moss 865, do you think it happened overnight?:::['3-24-197']
no. there was moss 1 that burned down my dad's garage.:::['3-24-198']
there was moss 2 that would only schedule appointments in january.:::['3-24-199']
and 862 others that i learned from.:::['3-24-200']
just like i learned from this fight never to let a guy stand on my neck.:::['3-24-201']
you didn't know that already?:::['3-24-202']
look, i'm gonna get better.:::['3-24-203']
okay? i promise you.:::['3-24-204']
just get a lot better.:::['3-24-206']
fast.:::['3-24-207']
one other thing.:::['3-24-208']
hoshi thinks you being ringside may have affected my concentration.:::['3-24-209']
that was the problem.:::['3-24-211']
how long until pete's fight? about five minutes.:::['3-24-212']
they're interviewing his opponent.:::['3-24-213']
apparently, he trains by going to iran and pulling the arms off thieves.:::['3-24-214']
wow. ha, ha. hot dog? four, please.:::['3-24-215']
i'm really nervous.:::['3-24-216']
so how did it go with bonnie?:::['3-24-218']
oh, i gotta tell you, i wasn't expecting to like her at all.:::['3-24-219']
i actually wasn't expecting to like anyone right now.:::['3-24-220']
but she's really terrific.:::['3-24-221']
it's too bad.:::['3-24-222']
no, i'm saying i liked her.:::['3-24-223']
there are other fish in the sea.:::['3-24-224']
i think she's great, okay? we're going out again.:::['3-24-225']
i hear you. are you capable of talking about anything else?:::['3-24-226']
which one's my turkey burger?:::['3-24-227']
the one next to my foot. sorry.:::['3-24-228']
fight's starting! we'll be right in.:::['3-24-229']
so did your boss try to slap you again today?:::['3-24-230']
nine times.:::['3-24-231']
i had to put on lotion.:::['3-24-232']
but it'll be okay. tomorrow, i conduct an experiment.:::['3-24-233']
and if all goes as planned, my butt will be smack-free.:::['3-24-234']
joey: fight's over!:::['3-24-235']
excuse me, doug?:::['3-24-236']
hey there, sports fan!:::['3-24-237']
bing! you got those numbers for me?:::['3-24-238']
no. i didn't do them.:::['3-24-239']
oh. you forgot?:::['3-24-240']
no, i just didn't do them.:::['3-24-241']
instead, i hung out with some friends and had a couple of beers.:::['3-24-242']
so i certainly don't deserve praise. verbal......or otherwise.:::['3-24-243']
i got tanked myself last night. pretty dicey drive home.:::['3-24-244']
tappan zee bridge never looked smaller. ha, ha.:::['3-24-245']
that's okay. you're still my number one guy! bing!:::['3-24-246']
doug! hmm?:::['3-24-247']
i'm a little bit uncomfortable with the way that you express yourself.:::['3-24-248']
is it the swearing? is it the constant swearing?:::['3-24-249']
because i gotta tell you, if it is, you can just kiss my ass!:::['3-24-250']
no. it's not about the swearing. it's more about......the way that you occasionally......concentrate your enthusiasm......on my buttocks.:::['3-24-251']
don't get me wrong, i appreciate the sentiment.:::['3-24-253']
it's just that i have a rather sensitive posterior.:::['3-24-254']
and besides, it's making all the other guys jealous.:::['3-24-255']
well, say no more. you know, it takes guts to bring this up.:::['3-24-256']
bing, you're okay.:::['3-24-257']
ha! ah! ah!:::['3-24-259']
would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant......or inside his shower drain?:::['3-24-260']
look. it's ross and that girl.:::['3-24-262']
look at that! it's a line of ants! they're working as a team!:::['3-24-263']
right. oh, yeah. it looks like ross is breaking up with her.:::['3-24-264']
i hope he lets her down easy.:::['3-24-265']
look at that! they are not breaking up! look at them!:::['3-24-266']
you know what that is? a second date, that's what that is.:::['3-24-267']
look, she just put her hand on his thigh.:::['3-24-268']
that's nothing. she's very sexually aggressive.:::['3-24-269']
it's your fault. now he loves her. he'll marry her. it's all your fault.:::['3-24-271']
you said it was okay.:::['3-24-272']
you said she was bald!:::['3-24-273']
was! was, was, was!:::['3-24-274']
we can't let it happen. we have to do something. we have to break them up.:::['3-24-275']
just go in there and shave her head! you owe me one bald girl!:::['3-24-276']
okay, first of all, breathe.:::['3-24-277']
second of all, i don't get it.:::['3-24-278']
aren't you the one that decided you didn't want to be with ross?:::['3-24-279']
well, isn't he your friend? don't you want him to be happy?:::['3-24-281']
it's just, you know, i didn't expect him to be this happy so soon.:::['3-24-284']
oh, no. what?:::['3-24-285']
we killed them all!:::['3-24-286']
it's not as bad as it looks. it's a precaution.:::['3-24-287']
i'm not supposed to move my spine.:::['3-24-288']
please tell me you're stopping now.:::['3-24-289']
i'm fine. i'd fight tonight if they'd let me.:::['3-24-290']
now, see this circle i'm marking off here?:::['3-24-291']
this is my zone of terror.:::['3-24-292']
you are insane! you've got to give this up!:::['3-24-293']
i can't until i'm the ultimate fighter.:::['3-24-294']
i will do it.:::['3-24-295']
the day will come when children will argue over who will win a fight......me or superman.:::['3-24-296']
not that i could beat superman, but kids are stupid.:::['3-24-297']
just sit down.:::['3-24-298']
please listen to me.:::['3-24-299']
you are terrible at this, okay? you are the worst ultimate fighter ever.:::['3-24-300']
i have a torn rotator cuff, a hairline fracture in my right forearm......and a severely bruised adam's:::['3-24-302']
apple, but that really hurt.:::['3-24-303']
well, then you know what?:::['3-24-304']
i care about you too much to watch you hurt yourself like this.:::['3-24-305']
so if you have to do this, you'll have to do it without me.:::['3-24-306']
if you're asking me to quit......then you're asking me:::['3-24-307']
to be someone i'm not.:::['3-24-308']
i've got to do this.:::['3-24-309']
then i've gotta go.:::['3-24-310']
monica? yes?:::['3-24-312']
could you leave a note? i'm on painkillers......and i might not:::['3-24-313']
remember this tomorrow.:::['3-24-314']
so, in conclusion, the lines all go up, so i'm happy.:::['3-24-315']
great job, team! tomorrow at 8:30.:::['3-24-316']
phil, nice job! stevens, way to go!:::['3-24-317']
goldberg, you maniac!:::['3-24-318']
bing, couldn't have done it without you. thank you, sir.:::['3-24-320']
oh, excuse me.:::['3-24-321']
i forgot my briefcase, you know, by accident.:::['3-24-322']
of course you did. forgot something else too, you bastard!:::['3-24-323']
well, what about you?:::['3-24-324']
you're not feeling left out, are you?:::['3-24-325']
no. heh. no, not at all. that's ridiculous.:::['3-24-326']
everybody else got one, and you want one too. don't you?:::['3-24-327']
yes, i do. ha-ha-ha.:::['3-24-328']
now, get on out of here, you!:::['3-24-329']
pete becker circles the ring.:::['3-24-330']
looks like he's just trying to feel him out.:::['3-24-331']
bruiser is charging!:::['3-24-332']
run, you crazy, rich freak!:::['3-24-333']
i can't watch this.:::['3-24-334']
check it out! pete's winning!:::['3-24-335']
really? no!:::['3-24-336']
announcer: uh-oh, bruiser has becker on the canvas and is going for his favorite area!:::['3-24-337']
all: oh! oh!:::['3-24-338']
wait! if that's his favorite area, why is he being so mean to it?:::['3-24-339']
ross: this is ironic.:::['3-24-340']
your last boyfriend, richard, didn't want to have kids.:::['3-24-341']
and from the looks of it, now pete can't.:::['3-24-342']
here you go, pheebs.:::['3-8-0']
who wants one of my special home-baked brownies?:::['3-8-1']
i'll have one.:::['3-8-2']
agh! ugh.:::['3-8-3']
that's okay. i'm not having one.:::['3-8-4']
no, no. it's just my tooth.:::['3-8-5']
all right. i'll have one.:::['3-8-6']
so you need a dentist? i've got a good one.:::['3-8-7']
thanks. i have a good one too. i just can't see him.:::['3-8-8']
see, that is the problem with invisible dentists.:::['3-8-9']
why can't you go to him?:::['3-8-10']
because every time i go to the dentist, somebody dies.:::['3-8-11']
that's so weird. every time i go to the dentist......i look down the hygienist's blouse.:::['3-8-12']
phoebe, what, um?:::['3-8-13']
first, it was my aunt mary.:::['3-8-15']
and then there was, um, john, my mailman.:::['3-8-16']
and then my cowboy friend, albino bob.:::['3-8-17']
ahem. and all these people actually died?:::['3-8-18']
yes. while i was in the chair.:::['3-8-19']
that's why i take care of my teeth. it's not about oral hygiene.:::['3-8-20']
i floss to save lives.:::['3-8-21']
come on, you didn't kill anybody.:::['3-8-22']
these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist.:::['3-8-23']
it's just a coincidence.:::['3-8-24']
tell that to them. oh, you can't! they're dead!:::['3-8-25']
thanks, gunther.:::['3-8-26']
um, can i get a napkin too?:::['3-8-28']
oh, like you don't already have everything.:::['3-8-29']
you're in pain. would you just go to the dentist? just go.:::['3-8-31']
fine. but if you're my next victim......don't come back as a poltergeist:::['3-8-32']
who sucks me into the tv set.:::['3-8-33']
although, don't feel like you can't visit.:::['3-8-35']
no. no, he's not.:::['3-8-37']
you guys, joey just saw janice kissing her ex-husband.:::['3-8-38']
huh? oh! ross: what?:::['3-8-39']
what are you gonna do? how are you gonna tell chandler?:::['3-8-40']
i was thinking about that. i think the best way would be......to not.:::['3-8-41']
joey, if you know about this, you have to tell him.:::['3-8-42']
it'll kill him. it'll just kill him.:::['3-8-43']
wait till i go to the dentist. maybe i'll kill him.:::['3-8-44']
joey: ew!:::['3-8-45']
ugly naked guy's using a hammock. it's like a play-doh fat factory.:::['3-8-46']
i'm going to the dentist. so listen......just be on the lookout for anything:::['3-8-47']
that you could fall into......or that can fall on you......or...:::['3-8-48']
all right, just look out!:::['3-8-49']
okay? and, um, i also just want to...:::['3-8-50']
i just want to tell you all that, um...:::['3-8-51']
i have a problem. i have to go into work for a few hours.:::['3-8-52']
some kids messed up the homo sapien display.:::['3-8-53']
what did they do?:::['3-8-54']
they painted over the word "sapien," for one thing.:::['3-8-55']
then they rearranged the figures. let's just leave it at that.:::['3-8-56']
do you want me to watch ben for you?:::['3-8-57']
yes, that's what i was gonna ask. thank you.:::['3-8-58']
woah, wait, hello! heh, what about me?:::['3-8-59']
you. you want to watch ben?:::['3-8-60']
that would be great! i just asked monica......because i know how empty her life is.:::['3-8-61']
hey, ross? i got a science question. yeah. mm-hm.:::['3-8-62']
if the homo sapiens were, in fact, "homo" sapiens......is that why they're extinct?:::['3-8-63']
joey, homo sapiens are people.:::['3-8-64']
hey, i'm not judging.:::['3-8-65']
look, benny! spoon!:::['3-8-66']

he's fine. let's just put him down.:::['3-8-76']
come here, babe. yes, you're such a good boy.:::['3-8-77']
how could you do that to him? ross trusted me! what's he gonna say?:::['3-8-78']
nothing, because we're not telling him.:::['3-8-79']
we're not? no.:::['3-8-80']
all right, i like that. okay.:::['3-8-81']
so we're okay. we're okay, aren't we?:::['3-8-82']
no, we're not okay. there's a bump.:::['3-8-83']
there's a bump. what bump?:::['3-8-84']
oh, my god! well, push it in! push it in!:::['3-8-85']
i can not push it in!:::['3-8-86']
okay, we're gonna need a distraction. okay.:::['3-8-87']
that's it. okay.:::['3-8-88']
the second ross walks in... yeah.:::['3-8-90']
...take him to your bedroom and do whatever you do that makes him go::::['3-8-91']
or......we could put a hat on his head.:::['3-8-92']
a hat! yes! we need a hat! where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?:::['3-8-93']
oh, oh, oh! i'll get rainy day bear!:::['3-8-94']
because he'll know what to do?:::['3-8-95']
oh, my god. you're a genius!:::['3-8-96']
oh, god. it's kind of sewn on.:::['3-8-97']
give it. give it. okay.:::['3-8-98']
agh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today!:::['3-8-100']
hey, hold on a second. hold on a second.:::['3-8-101']
do you think these pearls are nice?:::['3-8-102']
i'd prefer a mountain bike.:::['3-8-103']
janice's birthday's coming. i wanna get her something special.:::['3-8-104']
come in here with me. woah, woah, whoa, wait. woah.:::['3-8-105']
you wanna get her something special? get her flowers.:::['3-8-106']
get her candy. get her gum. girls love gum.:::['3-8-107']
that's a good idea. "dear janice: have a hubba-bubba birthday.":::['3-8-108']
i'd like to get her something serious.:::['3-8-109']
oh, you want something serious.:::['3-8-110']
you know what you should do? you should get her one of those, um......barium enemas.:::['3-8-111']
those are dead serious.:::['3-8-112']
look, i'm gonna go in here. and you don't buy me anything, ever!:::['3-8-113']
you can't! you can't. you can't buy her pearls.:::['3-8-114']
you just can't, you can't, you can't!:::['3-8-115']
oh, god. uh, okay.:::['3-8-117']
here's the thing. ahem.:::['3-8-118']
this is the thing. okay, the thing is...:::['3-8-119']
what is the thing? okay.:::['3-8-120']
i went down to the mattress king's showroom......and i saw janice kissing:::['3-8-121']
her ex-husband.:::['3-8-122']
they were in his office.:::['3-8-124']
well, she... she wouldn't do that. she's with me.:::['3-8-125']
i'm telling you, i saw it.:::['3-8-126']
well, you're wrong. okay? you're wrong.:::['3-8-127']
i'm not wrong.:::['3-8-128']
i wish i was.:::['3-8-129']
bet that barium enema doesn't sound so bad now, huh?:::['3-8-131']
it makes more sense as an ensemble. and it takes the focus off the hat.:::['3-8-132']
oh! you're alive! you're alive!:::['3-8-133']
see? i promised you no one would die, didn't i?:::['3-8-134']
we'll see about that. can i use your phone to call everyone i know?:::['3-8-135']
sure. we have no money. go ahead.:::['3-8-136']
hey, you're not dead! okay, see you.:::['3-8-137']
ben: monica.:::['3-8-138', '3-8-207']
oh, my god! he just said my name!:::['3-8-139']
did you hear that? yeah.:::['3-8-140']
monica bang!:::['3-8-141']
ahem. okay, i heard that.:::['3-8-142']
did he just say, "monica bang"? mm-hm.:::['3-8-143']
oh, my god! he's gonna rat me out!:::['3-8-144']
monica bang! oh, ho, ho.:::['3-8-145']
sweetie, you need to stop saying that now.:::['3-8-146']
it's no big deal. it's not even worth mentioning.:::['3-8-147']
you see? we all do it all the time.:::['3-8-148']
see? watch this.:::['3-8-149']
ben, ben, ben. ow.:::['3-8-150']
monica bang! everybody bang!:::['3-8-151']
ben bang!:::['3-8-152']
rachel bang!:::['3-8-153']
bang, rachel! bang!:::['3-8-154']
oh, isn't it fun? look at that! look at that!:::['3-8-155']
we all do it!:::['3-8-156']
okay, i'm stopping now. are you okay?:::['3-8-157']
oh, yeah. you know, if it's not a headboard, it's just not worth it.:::['3-8-158']
how's my bing-a-ling?:::['3-8-159']
you tell me.:::['3-8-162', '3-8-167']
anything you, uh, want to tell me?:::['3-8-163']
because if you, uh... you should...:::['3-8-164']
you would tell me.:::['3-8-165']
why are your eyes so wide?:::['3-8-166']
maybe it's because i was just fooling around with my ex.:::['3-8-168']
oh, no. no, no, no. that was you!:::['3-8-169']
all right! how did you know?:::['3-8-171']
joey told me. he saw you two kissing.:::['3-8-172']
in the park?:::['3-8-173']
no. in his office. how many kisses were there?:::['3-8-174']
just those two! wh...? why? why?:::['3-8-175']
why was there kissing? there should be no kissing!:::['3-8-176']
oh, i'm sorry, honey. i'm so, so...:::['3-8-177']
i'm so, so sorry. i just...:::['3-8-178']
what happened was i... i can't breathe.:::['3-8-179']
can you get me a bag or something? aah.:::['3-8-180']
here. here. aah.:::['3-8-181']
it's the receipt. i'll take it.:::['3-8-183']
look, i've got to know.:::['3-8-184']
are you finished with me?:::['3-8-185']
are you finished with him?:::['3-8-186']
do you still love him?:::['3-8-187']
do you still love me?:::['3-8-188']
all right, look......i'm gonna need an actual:::['3-8-189']
answer here, okay?:::['3-8-190']
so which is it?:::['3-8-191']
him or me?:::['3-8-192']
okay, if you're alive, you answer your phone!:::['3-8-194']
monica: ben, i won't tell your daddy that you had ice cream before dinner......if you won't tell him about:::['3-8-195']
our little bonking incident.:::['3-8-196']
number one, i don't think ben understands the concept of bribery.:::['3-8-197']
and number two, i...:::['3-8-198']
you said "number two.":::['3-8-200']
i also said "number one.":::['3-8-201']
ha-ha-ha, i know.:::['3-8-202']
hey, everyone! hi!:::['3-8-203']
how's my little boy?:::['3-8-204']
monica: he's perfect. aren't you, ben?:::['3-8-205']
he's never been better. what did you do, take him whaling?:::['3-8-206']
oh, my god! he just said your name! that's great! good job, ben!:::['3-8-208']
ben: monica bang!:::['3-8-209']
ha-ha-ha. that's right.:::['3-8-210']
that's what i'd sound like if i exploded.:::['3-8-211']
woo-hoo! the curse is broken! i called everybody i know......and everyone is alive!:::['3-8-212']
huh. phoebe: what?:::['3-8-213']
ugly naked guy looks awfully still.:::['3-8-214']
oh, my god, i killed another one!:::['3-8-215']
the curse is getting stronger too, to bring down something that big.:::['3-8-216']
maybe he's just taking a nap.:::['3-8-217']
i'm telling you, he hasn't moved since this morning.:::['3-8-218']
we should call somebody.:::['3-8-219']
tell them the naked guy we stare at isn't moving?:::['3-8-220']
we've got to find out if he's alive.:::['3-8-221']
how are we gonna do that? there's no way.:::['3-8-222']
well, there is one way.:::['3-8-223']
his window's open. i say......we poke him.:::['3-8-224']
you know how we, uh, save all those chopsticks......for no reason:::['3-8-226']
when we get chinese food?:::['3-8-227']
well, now we got a reason.:::['3-8-229']
well, we're fashioning a very long poking device.:::['3-8-231']
hey, uh, what's the matter?:::['3-8-233']
i talked to janice.:::['3-8-234']
oh, my god. is she going back to him?:::['3-8-235']
she doesn't know.:::['3-8-236']
says she loves us both.:::['3-8-237']
i woke up this morning, i was in love.:::['3-8-238']
i was happy!:::['3-8-239']
it serves me right for buying that 12-pack of condoms.:::['3-8-240']
and now i can't even return them, because she choked on the receipt!:::['3-8-241']
what are you, uh...? what are you gonna do?:::['3-8-242']
you know? what would you do?:::['3-8-244']
uh, it doesn't matter what i'd do.:::['3-8-245']
come on. come on. tell me.:::['3-8-246']
all right, you, uh......you probably won't want:::['3-8-247']
to hear this, but, uh......if it was me,and this is just me, i would, uh...:::['3-8-248']
i would bow out. what?:::['3-8-249']
they have a kid together......you know? they're like...:::['3-8-251']
they're, like, a family.:::['3-8-252']
and if, i don't know......if there's a chance:::['3-8-253']
they can make that work......i wouldn't want to be the guy:::['3-8-254']
who stood in the way.:::['3-8-255']
you, uh?:::['3-8-257']
you wanna come poke a nude guy?:::['3-8-258']
well, he's finally asleep. mm.:::['3-8-259']
about that, uh, bump on his head...:::['3-8-260']
are you, uh, sure it's a new bump?:::['3-8-261']
no offense, but i've always thought of ben as a fairly bumpy-headed child.:::['3-8-262']
it's okay if he bumps his head. kids bump their heads all the time.:::['3-8-263']
it was your first time babysitting. you did your best.:::['3-8-264']
i did! i know.:::['3-8-265']
you just have to watch them all the time.:::['3-8-266']
i did! i watched! i watched!:::['3-8-267']
i watched monica bang his head against that thing!:::['3-8-268']
monica did it?:::['3-8-269']
monica? um... yeah.:::['3-8-270']
did you notice anything weird about ben today?:::['3-8-271']
no, why?:::['3-8-272']
i was just playing with him, and we were doing the "alphabet song"......which he's good at.:::['3-8-273']
but he left out "e" and "f.":::['3-8-274']
it's like they just, uh, i don't know, fell out of his head.:::['3-8-275']
oh, and also, he's walking......kind of funny.:::['3-8-277']
it's like his left leg is moving a lot faster than his right leg.:::['3-8-278']
yeah, he's in there, just sort of, you know...:::['3-8-279']
oh, my god! i wrecked your baby!:::['3-8-280']
i hope it's still funny when you're in hell.:::['3-8-281']
you jerk!:::['3-8-282']
monica: you know i love that kid! ross: monica bang! monica bang!:::['3-8-283']
i'll get the hat.:::['3-8-285']
i have something to tell you.:::['3-8-286']
and i want you to let me get through it......because......it's not gonna be easy.:::['3-8-287']
i think you should go back with gary.:::['3-8-289']
i don't want to be the guy that breaks up a family.:::['3-8-290']
you know, when my parents split up, it was because of that guy.:::['3-8-291']
whenever i'd see him, i'd always think::::['3-8-292']
"you're the reason. you are why they're not together.":::['3-8-293']
and i hated that guy.:::['3-8-294']
and it didn't matter how nice he was or how happy he made my dad.:::['3-8-295']
yeah, wow.:::['3-8-297']
it's the right thing to do. ugh.:::['3-8-298']
oh, god. but before i can say goodbye......there's something i really:::['3-8-300']
need you to know.:::['3-8-301']
the way i feel about you......it's like i finally understand......what lionel richie's:::['3-8-302']
been singing about.:::['3-8-303']
you know? i mean, what we have......it's like movie love.:::['3-8-304']
you're my soul mate.:::['3-8-305']
i can't believe we're not gonna spend the rest of our lives together.:::['3-8-306']
then don't leave me.:::['3-8-307']
forget what i said! i was babbling! pick me!:::['3-8-309']
no, you were right! i gotta give my marriage another chance.:::['3-8-310']
pssh! no, you don't!:::['3-8-311']
no, i say you have to give your divorce another chance!:::['3-8-312']
oh, don't go.:::['3-8-314']
no, i gotta go.:::['3-8-315']
no. no. no, no.:::['3-8-316']
honey. honey. ha, ha.:::['3-8-317']
people are looking. i don't care.:::['3-8-318']
i don't care!:::['3-8-319']
yeah, um, okay. i'm...:::['3-8-320']
i'm leaving now.:::['3-8-321']
you can't leave! i have your shoe!:::['3-8-322']
rachel has those in burgundy.:::['3-8-324']
remember, something this big and long will be very difficult to maneuver.:::['3-8-325']
fortunately, i have experience in that area.:::['3-8-326']
can we please focus here? a naked man's life hangs in the balance.:::['3-8-327']
i'm telling you, he's dead.:::['3-8-328']
what we're about to have here is a dead fat guy on a stick!:::['3-8-329']
all right, ladies and gentlemen, let's poke.:::['3-8-330']
steady.:::['3-8-331']
okay, a little higher.:::['3-8-332']
careful of the angle.:::['3-8-333']
okay, okay. we're approaching the window.:::['3-8-334']
thread the needle. thread the needle.:::['3-8-335']
he's alive! he's alive!:::['3-8-336']
and yet we're still poking him.:::['3-8-337']
okay, retract the device! retract the device!:::['3-8-338']
he does not look happy. hey, hey.:::['3-8-339']
now he's showing us his poking device.:::['3-8-340']
hey, that's never gonna make it all the way over here, buddy! ha.:::['3-8-341']
i'll hold you close in my arms:::['3-8-342']
i can't resist your charms:::['3-8-343']
and love:::['3-8-344']
love:::['3-8-345', '3-8-356']
i'll be a fool for you:::['3-8-346']
i'm sure:::['3-8-347']
you know i don't mind:::['3-8-348']
oh, you know i don't mind:::['3-8-349']
yes:::['3-8-350']
you mean the world to me:::['3-8-351']
oh, i know i know:::['3-8-352']
i've found i've found:::['3-8-353']
in you:::['3-8-354']
my endless love:::['3-8-355']
lo... love love:::['3-8-357']
no, you want to put them in concentric circles.:::['3-9-4']
to the 10, to the 5. touchdown, giants!:::['3-9-7']
you know, for once, i am gonna try to watch one of these things.:::['3-9-8']
halftime.:::['3-9-9']
who wants to, uh, throw the ball around? get a little 3-on-3 going?:::['3-9-10']
oh, that would be so much fun! can i play too?:::['3-9-11']
i've never played football, ever.:::['3-9-12']
great! you can cover chandler.:::['3-9-13']
i don't... i don't really want to play.:::['3-9-14']
you never do anything since you and janice broke up.:::['3-9-15']
not true.:::['3-9-16']
i wanted to wear my bathrobe and eat peanut clusters all day.:::['3-9-17']
and start drinking in the morning. don't say i don't have goals!:::['3-9-18']
you have to start getting over her, all right?:::['3-9-19']
if you play, maybe it'll take your mind off janice.:::['3-9-20']
if you don't, everyone will be mad at you because the teams won't be even.:::['3-9-21']
all right, i'll play.:::['3-9-22']
yay! yay! let's do it! ross?:::['3-9-23']
what? rachel: wanna play football?:::['3-9-24']
monica and i aren't supposed to play football.:::['3-9-26']
says who? your mom? ha-ha-ha.:::['3-9-27']
ahem. every thanksgiving, um, we used to have a touch football game......called the geller bowl.:::['3-9-29']
no, no, no. you say that proudly!:::['3-9-30']
anyway, ross and i were always captains, and, um...:::['3-9-31']
it got kind of competitive. and one year, geller bowl vi......i accidentally broke ross' nose.:::['3-9-32']
it was so not an accident.:::['3-9-33']
she saw i was about to tag her, so she threw......her big fat grandma-arm:::['3-9-34']
elbow in my face......and just kept running.:::['3-9-35']
to score the winning touchdown, by the way.:::['3-9-36']
whoa, whoa, whoa! heh.:::['3-9-37']
uh, you did not win the game. the touchdown didn't count......because of the spectacularly illegal,and savage, nose-breaking.:::['3-9-38']
i won the game.:::['3-9-39']
yeah? then how come you didn't get the geller cup?:::['3-9-40']
ahem, there was a geller cup?:::['3-9-41']
yes, the trophy you got if you won the game.:::['3-9-42']
but dad said nobody won, and he was sick of our fighting.:::['3-9-43']
so he took the trophy......threw it in the lake.:::['3-9-44']
and was the curse lifted?:::['3-9-45']
anyway......mom said we weren't:::['3-9-46']
allowed to play football again.:::['3-9-47']
you know what? i think we should play a game.:::['3-9-48']
i mean, come on. it's been 12 years.:::['3-9-49']
wuss!:::['3-9-51']
all right, we're gonna play.:::['3-9-52']
wait. how we gonna get there? my mom won't let me cross the street.:::['3-9-53']

let's bring it in. rachel: wait.:::['3-9-56']
honey, throw it to me!:::['3-9-57']
here you go. aah!:::['3-9-58']
that almost hit me in the face!:::['3-9-59']
we have to pick captains.:::['3-9-60']
and then "tennilles.":::['3-9-61']
so how do we decide that?:::['3-9-62']
why don't we just bunny up? all: what?:::['3-9-63']
bunny! bunny!:::['3-9-64']

just sit right there. yeah, why don't you stick around?:::['3-9-139']
that went well. i think so.:::['3-9-140']
i was thinking about, uh, asking her for her number.:::['3-9-141']
thanks, man, but it makes a stronger statement if i ask for it myself.:::['3-9-142']
i was thinking about for me, as part of that getting-over-janice thing.:::['3-9-143']
oh, yeah. that.:::['3-9-144']
if it means that much, i'll let you have her.:::['3-9-145']
wh...? "let me have her"?:::['3-9-147']
you mean if you didn't, i wouldn't have a shot?:::['3-9-148']
i don't like to say it out loud......but yeah!:::['3-9-149']
we all have our strengths. you're better with numbers and stuff.:::['3-9-150']
math? you're giving me math?:::['3-9-151']

i want you to run a post-pattern to the left. and, sweetie...:::['3-9-154']

all i'm doing is running back and forth from the huddle.:::['3-9-156']
well, uh, you wanna just stay out there?:::['3-9-157']
can i see that for a second? yeah.:::['3-9-158']

well, now you have two.:::['3-9-164']
hey, i am good at math!:::['3-9-165']
that's it. i was still gonna let you have her.:::['3-9-166']
but now, prepare to feel bad about yourself.:::['3-9-167']
i've been preparing for that my entire life!:::['3-9-168']
or something about you that's mean!:::['3-9-169']
come on, guys. let's go.:::['3-9-170']
tie score. we're running out of time.:::['3-9-171']
forty-two, 38, hike!:::['3-9-172']
i got it! ooh! ugh!:::['3-9-173']
broken boobs! ow.:::['3-9-174']
joey: pheebs, run! monica: run, phoebe! run!:::['3-9-175']
god! touchdown! touchdown! joey: yes! touchdown! hey, oh!:::['3-9-176']
uh, the buzzer buzzed. it doesn't count.:::['3-9-178']
after the snap. before the snap.:::['3-9-179']
after. before.:::['3-9-180']
does it really matter? all: yes!:::['3-9-181']
but i made a touchdown. it was my first touchdown.:::['3-9-182']
pheebs, that's great. doesn't count.:::['3-9-183']
does so count. cheater, cheater, compulsive eater.:::['3-9-184']
that's fine. maybe you haven't grown up, but i have.:::['3-9-186']
oh, okay. dead leg!:::['3-9-187']
ugh, oh! oh.:::['3-9-188']
okay, fine. you want to win by cheating, go ahead.:::['3-9-189']
the touchdown does count. you win.:::['3-9-190']
whoo! yay! no!:::['3-9-191']
i won't do this again. i wanna beat you when you can't blame it......on the broken nose or the buzzer:::['3-9-192']
or the fact that you might have mono.:::['3-9-193']
let's just call this tie score and it's halftime.:::['3-9-194']
first, i don't play with cheaters.:::['3-9-195']
second of all, you know i had swollen glands!:::['3-9-196']
you know what? i think you'll play.:::['3-9-197']
oh, really? why's that?:::['3-9-198']
monica: because the winner gets this.:::['3-9-199']
the geller cup!:::['3-9-200']
is everybody else seeing a troll doll nailed to a two-by-four?:::['3-9-201']
all: mm-hm.:::['3-9-202']
okay, where the hell did you get that?:::['3-9-204']
when you went to the hospital for your nose......i swam into the lake:::['3-9-205']
and fished it out.:::['3-9-206']
that cup is mine!:::['3-9-207']
no, it's not. you want it, you're gonna have to win it.:::['3-9-208']
so are we not having dinner at all?:::['3-9-209']
come on, let's go. it's time to get serious. huddle up.:::['3-9-210']
keep your head in the game.:::['3-9-211']
it's hard, you know? his huddle's close to the dutch girl.:::['3-9-212']
if i take chandler out of the running, will you be able to focus?:::['3-9-213']
what are you gonna do? just make sure he catches the ball.:::['3-9-214']
i'll do the rest.:::['3-9-215']
ross: come on, you wuss! rachel: okay, come on.:::['3-9-216']
ross: go, cha... chandler. i got it!:::['3-9-217']
ross: come on! this way! come on!:::['3-9-218']
rachel: look out! oof!:::['3-9-219']
tackled by a girl! bet you don't see that every day.:::['3-9-221']
whoa, whoa, whoa! what's with the tackling?:::['3-9-222']
i just touched him and he went over.:::['3-9-224']
okay. you wanna play rough? we can play rough.:::['3-9-225']
boxing announcer: let's get ready to rumble!:::['3-9-226']
monica: go, go, go! ross: get her! get her!:::['3-9-228']
i love this game!:::['3-9-229']
where'd you get that?:::['3-9-230']
i went really long.:::['3-9-231']
forty-two to 21.:::['3-9-232']
like the turkey, ross is done!:::['3-9-233']
you got to pick first, so you got the better team.:::['3-9-234']
pathetic! why can't you just accept that we're winning......because i'm better than you?:::['3-9-235']
pfft! oh, what a great argument. exhaling!:::['3-9-236']
all right, i'll prove it to you. okay?:::['3-9-237']
i'll trade you joey for rachel and i'll still win the game.:::['3-9-238']
what? the guys against the girls?:::['3-9-239']
that's ridiculous because i'm only down by three touchdowns.:::['3-9-240']
oh, then bring it on!:::['3-9-241']
unless you're afraid you might lose to a bunch of girls.:::['3-9-242']
fine. rachel, you're with monica. joey, you're with me.:::['3-9-243']
i can not believe you're trading me.:::['3-9-244']
let's see what it's like to be on a winning team for a change.:::['3-9-245']
you're gonna let me play?:::['3-9-246']
the game is over? we eat now?:::['3-9-248']
no, the game's not over. we're switching teams.:::['3-9-249']
chandler finds me so intimidating that it's better if we're on the same team.:::['3-9-250']
ross: okay, let's play. let's go.:::['3-9-251']
oh, uh, hold on a second.:::['3-9-252']
ahem. where do dutch people come from?:::['3-9-253']
uh, well, the, uh......pennsylvania dutch:::['3-9-254']
come from pennsylvania.:::['3-9-255']
and the, uh, other dutch people?:::['3-9-256']
they come from somewhere near the netherlands, right?:::['3-9-257']
the netherlands is this make-believe place......where peter pan:::['3-9-259']
and tinker bell come from.:::['3-9-260']
enough "geography for the insane." let's play ball.:::['3-9-262']
no. no, i'm not playing with this guy.:::['3-9-263']
oh, fine with me. i've had enough of this.:::['3-9-264']
let's just cut to the chase. heidi, which of my boys do you like?:::['3-9-265']
joey: what are you doing?:::['3-9-266']
chandler: what are you doing? shh, shh.:::['3-9-267']
which do i like?:::['3-9-268']
yeah, for dating, general merriment, taking back to your windmill?:::['3-9-269']
well, if i had to choose right now......which, by the way,i find really weird......i would have to say chandler.:::['3-9-270']
wait a minute. she didn't understand the question.:::['3-9-272']
why don't you have captain hook explain it to her?:::['3-9-273']
i'm sorry. that is my truth.:::['3-9-274']
you hear that? that is her truth, mr. "i'll let you have her"!:::['3-9-275']
i win! you suck! i rule all!:::['3-9-276']
mini-wave in celebration of me!:::['3-9-277']
i am now thinking i would like to change my answer to "no one.":::['3-9-279']
i now find you shallow, and, um......a dork.:::['3-9-281']
heh. nice going.:::['3-9-283']
you just saved yourself a couple months of sex.:::['3-9-284']
it doesn't matter, because she picked me.:::['3-9-285']
from now on, i get the dates......and you stay home on saturday nights:::['3-9-286']
watching ready, set, cook!:::['3-9-287']
save the breakthroughs for therapy. the clock is ticking.:::['3-9-288']
we have no time, and we are losing to girls.:::['3-9-289']
we're not gonna lose to girls.:::['3-9-290']
it's 42-21!:::['3-9-291']
this sucks! i was just up by that much!:::['3-9-292']
are we playing football or what? come on, you hairy-backed marys!:::['3-9-293']
we have to do this. we're playing for women everywhere.:::['3-9-294']
think about every lousy date you ever had.:::['3-9-295']
every guy who kept one eye on the tv while you were making out.:::['3-9-296']
oh, my god. you dated someone with a glass eye too?:::['3-9-297']
come on, okay? this is for all womankind. let's kill them!:::['3-9-298']
yeah! kill them!:::['3-9-299']
all right, i want to kill them too.:::['3-9-300']
but they're boys.:::['3-9-301']
you know, how are we gonna beat three boys?:::['3-9-302']
a minute and a half left, and we're down by two points.:::['3-9-303']
two points, ladies.:::['3-9-304']
phoebe, you do a buttonhook again.:::['3-9-305']
rachel, you go long.:::['3-9-306']
no, don't make me go long. use me. they never cover me.:::['3-9-307']
honey, there's a reason.:::['3-9-308']
i'm not lame, okay? i can do something.:::['3-9-309']
would you let me throw? this is my game too.:::['3-9-310']
let her throw the ball.:::['3-9-311']
sweep behind, i'll pitch it. you throw it downfield to phoebe.:::['3-9-312']
break! break!:::['3-9-314']
ross: all right, here we go.:::['3-9-315']
thirty-two, 71, hike!:::['3-9-316']
chandler: one mississippi, two mississippi, three mississippi!:::['3-9-317']
catch it! ow!:::['3-9-319']
i'm so sorry. are you okay? no, i'm not okay!:::['3-9-320']
they were coming at me, and i didn't know what to do.:::['3-9-321']
thirty seconds left on the timer. ross: woo-hoo.:::['3-9-322']
so we get to take that, uh, stupid troll thing home.:::['3-9-323']
come on! hurry! we're running out of time.:::['3-9-324']
huddle up! phoebe: okay.:::['3-9-325']
oh! this is our last huddle!:::['3-9-326']
all right, phoebe, get open. rachel......go long.:::['3-9-327']
ahh! i did it! touchdown! we did it!:::['3-9-330']
you know? funny thing, actually. the end zone starts at that pole.:::['3-9-331']
so you're five feet short. so......ha-ha-ha, we win!:::['3-9-332']
yes, yes, yes!:::['3-9-334']
wait, explain something, though.:::['3-9-335']
if nobody tagged rachel, then isn't the play still going?:::['3-9-336']
joey: let me in! let me in! ross: no way! let go!:::['3-9-337']
let go? i'm a tiny little woman!:::['3-9-338']
guys, come on, it's thanksgiving!:::['3-9-339']
it's not important who wins or loses.:::['3-9-340']
the important thing is the dutch girl picked me!:::['3-9-341']
me, not you! holland loves chandler! thank you, amsterdam! good night!:::['3-9-342']
we should play football more often.:::['3-9-344']
maybe there's a league we could join.:::['3-9-345']
isn't there a "national football league"?:::['3-9-346']
yes, there is. they play on sundays and monday nights.:::['3-9-347']
oh, shoot! i work monday nights.:::['3-9-348']
this stuffing is amazing. do you think we should bring them some?:::['3-9-350']
when they're hungry, they'll come in.:::['3-9-351']
monica: let go! ross: no, you let go!:::['3-9-352']
how come it's always us left holding the ball?:::['3-9-353']
i don't know. i guess the other people just don't care enough.:::['3-9-354']
hey, it's starting to snow.:::['3-9-355']
give it to me! let go! let it go! come on, let go!:::['3-9-356']
so, uh, your first sexual experience was with a woman?:::['3-25-0']
all right, i was 15. it was my best friend, ruth......and we got drunk on that hard cider.:::['3-25-1']
and then suddenly, i don't know, we were making out.:::['3-25-2']
tell it again.:::['3-25-3']
is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex?:::['3-25-5']
yeah, sure. well, you know, earlier, she was talking about geography.:::['3-25-6']
joey, she was listing the countries she's done it in.:::['3-25-7']
well, i think we all learned something.:::['3-25-8']
hey, you guys. look what i found. look at this.:::['3-25-9']
that's my mom's writing. look.:::['3-25-10']
"me and frank and phoebe, graduation, 1965.":::['3-25-11']
do you know what that means? that you're actually 50?:::['3-25-12']
no, no. that's not "me" phoebe. that's her pal, phoebe.:::['3-25-13']
according to her high school yearbook, they were bff.:::['3-25-14']
best friends forever. both oh.:::['3-25-15']
that's great. that is so cool.:::['3-25-16']
i know. so this woman probably could...:::['3-25-17']
like, has all kinds of stories about my parents.:::['3-25-18']
and she might even know where my dad is.:::['3-25-19']
so i looked her up and she lives by the beach.:::['3-25-20']
so maybe this weekend we can go to the beach.:::['3-25-21']
joey: yeah, we can. group: yeah.:::['3-25-22']
shoot, i can't go. i have to work. that's too bad.:::['3-25-23']
aw, big fat bummer.:::['3-25-24']
so great. okay, tomorrow we're gonna drive out to montauk.:::['3-25-25']
hey, bonnie had sex there.:::['3-25-26']
would you look at them?:::['3-25-27']
i'm never gonna find a boyfriend again.:::['3-25-28']
i'm gonna die an old maid.:::['3-25-29']
you're not gonna die an old maid.:::['3-25-30']
maybe an old spinster cook.:::['3-25-31']
thanks. hey, besides, worse comes to worse......i'll be your boyfriend.:::['3-25-32']
why is that so funny?:::['3-25-35']
you made a joke, right?:::['3-25-36']
so i laughed.:::['3-25-37']
a little too hard.:::['3-25-38']
what, am i not, uh, boyfriend material?:::['3-25-39']
no. you're chandler.:::['3-25-40']
you know. chandler.:::['3-25-41']
okay, so we've established my name, and hit me.:::['3-25-42']
but theoretically, say we weren't friends. say it's a blind date.:::['3-25-43']
i show up at your door and i'm, like, uh::::['3-25-44']
"hey, nice to meet you. hey. hey.":::['3-25-45']
i'd probably be scared of a guy using a fake voice.:::['3-25-46']
joey: hey. oh, hey. oh, good. you bought food.:::['3-25-47']
no, just my luggage.:::['3-25-48']
joey: hey. chandler: hey, guys.:::['3-25-49']
joey: all right. yeah.:::['3-25-50']
oh, i am having the best karma this week.:::['3-25-51']
first, i find this woman who knew my parents......and then my client with the fuzzy back:::['3-25-52']
gives me his beach house.:::['3-25-53']
what about that, uh, bike messenger you hit?:::['3-25-54']
oh, i wasn't talking about his karma.:::['3-25-55']
rachel: hey. group: hey.:::['3-25-56']
joey: hey, check out the hat.:::['3-25-57']
wait a minute, i know that hat.:::['3-25-58']
i was taken aboard that hat.:::['3-25-59']
they did experiments on me.:::['3-25-60']
i can't have children.:::['3-25-61']
seriously, where did you get the hat?:::['3-25-62']
ross gave it to me.:::['3-25-63']
aw, i think she looks good. thank you.:::['3-25-64']
did he buy it for you......or win it for you?:::['3-25-65']
well, excuse me, my fashion-impaired friends......i'm here to tell you that hats are back.:::['3-25-66']
and this time, they've ganged up and formed one giant super-hat.:::['3-25-67']
ross: go, go, go.:::['3-25-68']
rachel: now everybody wants to be under the hat.:::['3-25-69']
what's with all this sand?:::['3-25-71']
oh, yeah. bob said there might be flood damage.:::['3-25-72']
either that or he has a really big cat.:::['3-25-73']
well, yes, it's kind of an unusual house.:::['3-25-74']
it has, um, three beautiful bedrooms and, uh, no baths.:::['3-25-75']
but, you know, the ocean is right there.:::['3-25-76']
knock, knock, knock.:::['3-25-77', '3-15-221']

well, i assume the, uh, happy couple isn't up yet?:::['3-25-202']
did you guys hear them last night?:::['3-25-203']
oh, yeah. i don't know what they were doing......but sea turtles actually came up:::['3-25-204']
to the house.:::['3-25-205']
good morning. group: hey.:::['3-25-206']
how'd everybody sleep? great.:::['3-25-207']
like a log.:::['3-25-208']
both: us too.:::['3-25-209']
i'm going for a walk.:::['3-25-210']
good morning. nice breasts, by the way.:::['3-25-211']
hey, what happened to you?:::['3-25-212']
oh, uh, nothing. i just felt like hanging out here and reading.:::['3-25-213']
oh, the water was so great.:::['3-25-214']
we jumped off this pier and my suit came off.:::['3-25-215']
oh. sorry i missed that.:::['3-25-216']
joey and chandler sure are funny.:::['3-25-217']
i think i brought back half the beach in my hair.:::['3-25-219']
it was so much easier when i used to shave my head.:::['3-25-220']
you know, i gotta tell you......i just loved your look:::['3-25-221']
when you were bald.:::['3-25-222']
really? oh.:::['3-25-223']
because i think about shaving it all off again sometimes.:::['3-25-224']
i mean, you definitely should do that.:::['3-25-226']
you know what? i should do it. yeah.:::['3-25-227']
you know what? thank you, rachel. you are so cool.:::['3-25-228']
oh, stop. go on.:::['3-25-229']
now, go shave that head. bonnie: all right.:::['3-25-230']
what's the matter, pheebs?:::['3-25-231']
she canceled. my namesake canceled on me.:::['3-25-232']
chandler: what? she claims she had to go out of town.:::['3-25-233']
she's avoiding me.:::['3-25-234']
she doesn't want to tell me where my father is. she knows and she won't tell.:::['3-25-235']
aw, pheebs, that sucks.:::['3-25-236']
yeah, well, don't "aw, pheebs, that sucks" me yet.:::['3-25-237']
where are you going? well, she's out of town.:::['3-25-238']
so there's gotta be something in her house that tells me where my father is.:::['3-25-239']
uh, pheebs, some people call that "breaking and entering.":::['3-25-240']
well, are any of those people here? chandler & joey: oh, no.:::['3-25-241']
okay. look, i'll do something nice, okay?:::['3-25-242']
i'll fill her ice trays. good?:::['3-25-243']
wow. wow!:::['3-25-245']
ha, look what you did.:::['3-25-246']
you wanna touch it? no, but it's great.:::['3-25-247']
come on, touch it.:::['3-25-248']
you can feel all the bones in your skull.:::['3-25-250']
i was having a little chat with bonnie, and, uh, guess what.:::['3-25-252']
she happened to bring up, you know......who was behind the whole, um,head-shaving idea.:::['3-25-253']
and now, who was it? oh, that's right. that's right, it was you.:::['3-25-254']
that was her idea.:::['3-25-255']
i just gave her a nudge.:::['3-25-256']
she said you gave her the razor.:::['3-25-257']
yo. hey.:::['3-25-258']
so anyone up for a midnight dip in the ocean?:::['3-25-259']
uh, no, i'm good. rachel: no, thanks.:::['3-25-260']
okay, i'll see you in a bit. okay, have fun. bye.:::['3-25-261']
come on, see? she doesn't look that bad.:::['3-25-262']
you can see the moonlight bouncing off her head.:::['3-25-263']
what the hell were you thinking? i don't know.:::['3-25-264']
you don't know? rach, you balded my girlfriend.:::['3-25-265']
all right. ross.:::['3-25-266']
do you think it's easy for me to see you with somebody else?:::['3-25-267']
you know what? you're the one who ended it.:::['3-25-268']
you still love me.:::['3-25-271']
yeah, so? you love me.:::['3-25-272']
no... mm.:::['3-25-273']
what does this mean? what do you...?:::['3-25-274']
i mean, do you want to get back together?:::['3-25-275']
i still can't forgive you for what you did.:::['3-25-279']
i just... but sometimes when i'm with you, i just feel so...:::['3-25-280']
i just... what?:::['3-25-283']
i feel...:::['3-25-284']
no. i don't care.:::['3-25-285']
i'm not playing one-on-one strip poker with you for practice.:::['3-25-286']
but i made cards.:::['3-25-287']
i'm going upstairs.:::['3-25-290']
joey: good night. chandler: night.:::['3-25-291']
wanna play strip poker for practice?:::['3-25-292']
my ass.:::['3-25-294']
ooh. shh.:::['3-25-297']
shh, shh.:::['3-25-298']
aah! no! oh, it's me. it's me.:::['3-25-300']
i didn't wanna make any noise. then don't break in.:::['3-25-301']
i'm sorry. what are you doing here?:::['3-25-302']
i came to fill your ice-cube tray.:::['3-25-303']
um, okay.:::['3-25-305']
okay, look. huh. ahem.:::['3-25-306']
i took this picture from your fridge, okay? because i know that this is my father.:::['3-25-307']
yeah, this is frank buffay, and you were standing right there next to him.:::['3-25-308']
now, look, i deserve to know where i came from.:::['3-25-309']
all right? so if you can help me find my father, then you should.:::['3-25-310']
otherwise, you're just mean.:::['3-25-311']
so just tell me the truth.:::['3-25-312']
the man in that picture is chuck mangione.:::['3-25-314']
my father is chuck mangione?:::['3-25-315']
no, no. that's just chuck mangione.:::['3-25-316']
i sold him a house last year.:::['3-25-317']
and i'm very sorry, but i really don't know where your father is.:::['3-25-318']
and that's the truth.:::['3-25-319']
but, um, you're right.:::['3-25-321']
i think that a person should know where they come from.:::['3-25-322']
which is why i, uh...:::['3-25-323']
i'm your mother.:::['3-25-326']
you know, i wanted to tell you yesterday, but i just...:::['3-25-328']
i felt all floopy, and...:::['3-25-329']
i'm telling you. you guys are getting back together.:::['3-25-330']
that's not true. she doesn't even know what she wants.:::['3-25-331']
rachel's still mad about the whole thing.:::['3-25-332']
okay, well, then you gotta back away. you don't need that kind of hurt.:::['3-25-333']
take it from a guy who's......never had a long-term relationship.:::['3-25-334']
i know, but i really want to go up there and finish that kiss.:::['3-25-335']
bonnie: hey. aah.:::['3-25-336']
you guys, the water is great. you should really go in.:::['3-25-337']
oh, uh, no, thanks. i just had an m&m.:::['3-25-338']
okay. well, good night.:::['3-25-339']
don't be too long. okey-dokey.:::['3-25-341']
there is not one hair on that head.:::['3-25-342']
hey, it'll grow back, right? and she's really fun, and she's cool.:::['3-25-343']
and i'm finally moving on.:::['3-25-344']
i mean, getting over rachel was so, ugh, you know?:::['3-25-345']
you know, i'm finally feeling sane again. and now if i go up there......and i kiss her and...:::['3-25-346']
god, i want to kiss her.:::['3-25-347']
and it doesn't work out, right?:::['3-25-348']
do i really wanna put myself through that again?:::['3-25-349']
so let me get this straight.:::['3-25-350']
if you go with bonnie tonight......you're doing the smart,healthy thing and moving on.:::['3-25-351']
yeah. right?:::['3-25-352']
and if you go with rachel, bonnie's free tonight?:::['3-25-353']
hi there.:::['3-25-355']
that's that weird voice again.:::['3-25-356']
let me try it again.:::['3-25-357']
you're gonna wanna date this next guy, i swear. okay, come on.:::['3-25-358']
hi, i'm dorf.:::['3-25-359']
your date for the evening.:::['3-25-360']
oh, come on. dorf on dating? that's good stuff.:::['3-25-361']
here you go. thank you.:::['3-19-0']
gunther: "say, rachel......i was wondering if you'd like to go:::['3-19-1']
to a movie with me sometime......as my lover.":::['3-19-2']
mm. too out there.:::['3-19-3']
"maybe you'd just like to get something to eat with me sometime......as my lover.":::['3-19-4']
all right, let's go shopping.:::['3-19-6']
you know, before we go, uh, there's something i need to say.:::['3-19-7']
oh. okay. okay.:::['3-19-8']
i've kind of had this, uh... this crush on you.:::['3-19-9']
but since you were with ross, i didn't do anything about it.:::['3-19-10']
now that you're not, i'd really like to ask you out sometime.:::['3-19-11']
so that's what i'm doing now.:::['3-19-12']
wow. um...:::['3-19-13']
i dropped a cup.:::['3-19-14']
so that's why within a few years, that voice recognition......is gonna be pretty much standard:::['3-19-15']
on any computer.:::['3-19-16']
you know, so you could be, like, "wash my car. clean my room.":::['3-19-17']
it's not gonna be able to do any of those things......but it'll understand:::['3-19-18']
what you're saying.:::['3-19-19']
oh, this was so great. yeah, it was.:::['3-19-20']
hello, people who do not live here.:::['3-19-23']
both: hi. hello.:::['3-19-24']
i gave you a key for emergencies.:::['3-19-25']
we were out of doritos.:::['3-19-26']
hey, how'd the date go with mr. millionaire?:::['3-19-27']
"mr. millionaire. new, from snooty playthings.:::['3-19-28']
third wife sold separately.":::['3-19-29']
he's great. i mean,we have such a good time together.:::['3-19-30']
he's so funny and so sweet. and i'm not attracted to him at all.:::['3-19-31']
still? monica: no.:::['3-19-32']
it's driving me crazy. i mean, in every other way, he's like the perfect guy.:::['3-19-33']
he has everything. plus, he actually has everything.:::['3-19-34']
life-sized lmperial storm troopers from sharper lmage?:::['3-19-35']
wow. can joey and i put them on and fight?:::['3-19-37']
oh, mommy. oh, daddy. i am a big old baddy.:::['3-19-38']
i guess he must've gotten the part in that play.:::['3-19-39']
oh. either that or gloria estefan was right.:::['3-19-40']
eventually, the rhythm is going to get you.:::['3-19-41']
joe, how's it going? good.:::['3-19-42']
ah, so you're playing adrianne, huh?:::['3-19-44']
yes. are you one of the retarded cousins?:::['3-19-45']
no, no. uh, i'm playing your husband, victor. i'm joey tribbiani.:::['3-19-46']
hi. nice to meet you. kate miller.:::['3-19-47']
heh. so the, uh, play's pretty great, huh?:::['3-19-48']
oh, yeah. i love jennifer banberry's work.:::['3-19-49']
she's so brilliantly incisive......when it comes to deconstructing:::['3-19-50']
the psyche of the middle class.:::['3-19-51']
oh, forget about it. she rocks. ha, ha.:::['3-19-52']
where do i know you from?:::['3-19-53']
dr. drake ramoray?:::['3-19-54']
days of our lives?:::['3-19-55']
voted most datable neurosurgeon by teen beat?:::['3-19-56']
so you're a soap actor.:::['3-19-58']
well, this must be exciting for you, being in a real play. hmm?:::['3-19-59']
hey, i've done plays before. i'm a serious actor.:::['3-19-60']
that infomercial.:::['3-19-61']
for the milk-carton-spout thing.:::['3-19-62']
you're the guy who doesn't know how to pour milk.:::['3-19-63']
see, i actually can pour milk. but i got you believing that i couldn't.:::['3-19-64']
ha, ha. now, see, that's acting.:::['3-19-65']
right. at the end, you choked on a cookie.:::['3-19-66']
yeah, that was real.:::['3-19-67']
wow. i cannot believe mark asked you out. i know.:::['3-19-68']
well, so, what are you gonna tell him?:::['3-19-69']
well, i told him i would think about it, but i'm gonna tell him no.:::['3-19-70']
i mean, i think i'd say no to anybody right now.:::['3-19-72']
oh, but it was so strange. i mean, i'm standing there......with this charming, cute guy:::['3-19-73']
who's asking me to go out with him......which i'm allowed to do......and i felt guilty, you know,like i'd be cheating on ross or something.:::['3-19-74']
wow. so, okay, maybe that means......that you're not over ross yet:::['3-19-75']
and you have issues with your father.:::['3-19-76']
i don't have any issues with my father. okay, so it's probably just the ross thing.:::['3-19-77']
i hate this woman. i hate her.:::['3-19-78']
she told everyone in the company about that infomercial......and now they all keep asking me:::['3-19-79']
to open their drinks.:::['3-19-80']
okay? and whenever i can't do it, they're all, like, laughing at me.:::['3-19-81']
hello. chandler & joey: hey.:::['3-19-82']
so rachel called.:::['3-19-83']
wants to see me.:::['3-19-84']
going over in a minute.:::['3-19-85']
wow. what do you think she wants? well, maybe the crazy fog has lifted......and she realizes that life without me......sucks.:::['3-19-86']
it's possible. you are very lovable. i'd miss you if i broke up with you.:::['3-19-87']
just trying to be supportive.:::['3-19-88']
well, be supportive like a guy.:::['3-19-89']
if i broke up with you, i'd miss you.:::['3-19-90']
you, uh, wanted to see me?:::['3-19-92']

i mean, why am i only attracted to guys where there's no future?:::['3-19-143']
either they're too old or they're too young.:::['3-19-144']
and there's pete, who's crazy about me......and he's absolutely perfect,and there's, like, zip going on.:::['3-19-145']
seriously. does it sound like something's wrong with me?:::['3-19-146']
yeah, kind of.:::['3-19-147']
happy? is that what i'm supposed to be, vic?:::['3-19-148']
happy?:::['3-19-149']
well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be? huh?:::['3-19-150']
because i sure as hell can't figure it out.:::['3-19-151', '3-19-278']
i talk to you, and nothing.:::['3-19-152']
you look at me, and it's nothing.:::['3-19-153']
tasty.:::['3-19-155']
i'm really starting to feel like you guys have a history. it's nice.:::['3-19-156']
i have a question about this scene. man: yes.:::['3-19-157']
well, i don't understand why adrianne's attracted to victor.:::['3-19-158']
peel the onion.:::['3-19-159']
first of all, he's good-looking.:::['3-19-160']
i think my character is gonna need a bit more of a reason than that.:::['3-19-162']
oh, hey, how about this one? uh, it says so in the script.:::['3-19-163']
you know, i don't know why my character likes you either.:::['3-19-164']
i mean, it says in the script here that you're a bitch.:::['3-19-165']
it doesn't say that in the script. it does in mine.:::['3-19-166']
i can blow-dry it, i can put gel on it. it doesn't matter.:::['3-19-167']
i still wind up with this little cowlick-y thing......on the middle part of my head.:::['3-19-168']
it's so annoying.:::['3-19-169']
does it bug you? you bug me.:::['3-19-170']
is there any chance you didn't see that?:::['3-19-171']
chandler: ross, you gotta stop, okay?:::['3-19-172']
you can't just stare through the peephole for three hours.:::['3-19-173']
you're gonna get peep-eye.:::['3-19-174']
i knew it. i knew it. i always knew she liked him.:::['3-19-175']
she'd say no, but here we are, right?:::['3-19-176']
we just broke up, first thing she does.:::['3-19-177']
you didn't just break up.:::['3-19-178']
hey, it's been, like, three weeks.:::['3-19-179']
you slept with somebody three hours after you thought you broke up.:::['3-19-180']
i mean, bullets have left guns slower.:::['3-19-181']
ross: here they come. here they... oh.:::['3-19-182']
if she kisses him good night, i'm gonna kill myself. i swear.:::['3-19-183']
come on. date over. date over.:::['3-19-185']
here we go. she's going in. okay.:::['3-19-186']
she's going in. ha, ha. wait. he's going in.:::['3-19-187']
he's going in.:::['3-19-188']
the door's closed. i can't see anything with the door closed.:::['3-19-189']
and the inventor of the door rests happily in his grave.:::['3-19-190']
okay, i have to do something. i mean, i have to stop it.:::['3-19-191']
stop what? i don't know.:::['3-19-192']
but i have a feeling that my being there will do it.:::['3-19-193']
i'll go over and i will borrow something.:::['3-19-194']
juice. i need juice. no.:::['3-19-195']
you can't. a little help.:::['3-19-196']
they must be stopped. i am your friend......and i am not gonna let you do this.:::['3-19-197']
you are surprisingly strong.:::['3-19-198']
i need juice. people need juice. look, man...:::['3-19-199']
people need juice. juice. they need... listen to me.:::['3-19-200']
she's moving on, okay? if it's not this guy, it's gonna be somebody else.:::['3-19-201']
and unless you're thinking about subletting my peephole......you are gonna have to get used:::['3-19-202']
to the fact that the relationship is over.:::['3-19-203']
okay, man? it's over.:::['3-19-204']
yeah, okay. okay.:::['3-19-205', '3-3-55']
it's just i miss her so much.:::['3-19-206']
why do all your coffee mugs have numbers on the bottom?:::['3-19-208']
oh, that's so monica can keep track.:::['3-19-209']
that way, if one of them is missing, she can be like, "where's number 27?":::['3-19-210']
no, and i don't think i'm gonna want to.:::['3-19-212']
yep. yep. that's what i didn't want to know.:::['3-19-214']
yeah. oh, mark, i'm just doing this for the wrong reasons, you know?:::['3-19-215']
i'm just doing it to get back at ross.:::['3-19-216']
i'm sorry. it's not very fair to you.:::['3-19-217']
ah. fair, shmair. you know?:::['3-19-218']
look, you wanna get back at ross, i am here for you.:::['3-19-219']
no, no. i say we get back at him right here on this couch. right here.:::['3-19-221']
i'm sorry about this.:::['3-19-223']
you sure? yeah.:::['3-19-225']
i can just go home and get back at him by myself.:::['3-19-226']
woman: and should become the penicillin of the 21 st century.:::['3-19-227']
and so today, this hospital is about to take major steps......toward leading that revolution.:::['3-19-228']
it is truly ironic. hey. can i ask you something?:::['3-19-229']
where are we?:::['3-19-230']
well, with all these doctors and nurses......i'm gonna say, midget rodeo.:::['3-19-231']
just tell me the truth.:::['3-19-232']
um, you know, i don't think i told you this......but, um, i just recently got out:::['3-19-234']
of a really serious relationship.:::['3-19-235']
oh, right. wasn't that like a year ago?:::['3-19-236']
so i did tell you.:::['3-19-237']
okay, well, you know, that's not really the thing.:::['3-19-238']
the thing is, is that right now i'm just in a place in my life......where i just need to focus on me.:::['3-19-239']
do you know what i mean? oh, yeah, i know.:::['3-19-241']
i so want to be attracted to you. but you're not. okay. good.:::['3-19-242']
you know what? don't be. this is not...:::['3-19-244']
don't be, because it's not so bad.:::['3-19-245']
it's not? yeah. i know i'm no jon bon jovi.:::['3-19-246']
or someone you find attractive.:::['3-19-247']
i just think, you know......that you might end up:::['3-19-248']
feeling differently.:::['3-19-249']
well, look, i don't want this to come out wrong......but, uh, you seem awfully confident:::['3-19-250']
for a guy i just told i wasn't attracted to.:::['3-19-251']
yeah, stupidly charming, isn't it?:::['3-19-252']
uh, listen. let's... you wanna get something to eat?:::['3-19-253']
because this place is kind of depressing.:::['3-19-254']
woman: now the man who made this possible, mr. peter becker.:::['3-19-255']
i don't think this town is big enough for the both of us to relax in.:::['3-19-257']
draw.:::['3-19-258', '3-19-324']
i wasn't doing anything.:::['3-19-259']
uh-oh. what did she do now?:::['3-19-260']
just because she went to yale drama, she thinks she's, like, the greatest actress......since sliced bread.:::['3-19-261']
ah, sliced bread. a wonderful lady macbeth.:::['3-19-262']
god, i just... i hate her. i hate her with her "oh, i'm so talented"......and "oh, i'm so pretty,":::['3-19-263']
and "oh, i smell so good.":::['3-19-264']
i think somebody has a crush on somebody.:::['3-19-265']
hey, chandler, can we please try and stay focused on my problem here?:::['3-19-266']
i'm talking about you, you big, big freak.:::['3-19-268']
oh. you're out of your mind.:::['3-19-270']
hey, you've done nothing but talk about her for the last 48 hours.:::['3-19-271']
if you were in school yard......you'd be pulling her pigtails:::['3-19-272']
and pushing her down now.:::['3-19-273']
oh, yeah? then how come i keep thinking about her......in all these sexual scenarios:::['3-19-274']
and stuff, huh?:::['3-19-275']
happy? is that what i'm supposed to be, vic? happy?:::['3-19-276']
well, why don't you tell me what you're supposed to be, huh?:::['3-19-277']
i talk to you, and it's nothing.:::['3-19-279']
you look at me, and nothing.:::['3-19-280']
you guys make me fly.:::['3-19-282']
high.:::['3-19-283']
okay, we're gonna pick it up here tomorrow.:::['3-19-284']
well, that was, uh... better?:::['3-19-285']
yeah, yeah, it was definitely......an improvement.:::['3-19-286']
good night. joey: uh, kate.:::['3-19-287']
you, uh... you forgot your shoes.:::['3-19-289']
i'm probably gonna need those, huh?:::['3-19-290']
okay. hey, listen......you, uh, feel like getting:::['3-19-291']
a cup of coffee?:::['3-19-292']
um... yo. kate.:::['3-19-293']
you ready to go? yeah.:::['3-19-294']
very nice. very nice.:::['3-19-295']
see you tomorrow, huh? yeah. yeah. sure.:::['3-19-297']
right. good night.:::['3-19-298']
why isn't it "spiderman"?:::['3-19-300']
you know, like goldman, silverman?:::['3-19-301']
because it's not his last name.:::['3-19-302']
it isn't? no, it's not, like...:::['3-19-303']
like phil spiderman.:::['3-19-304']
he's a spider......man.:::['3-19-305']
you know, like, uh... like goldman is a last name.:::['3-19-306']
but there's no gold man.:::['3-19-307']
there should be a gold man.:::['3-19-309']
hey. monica: hey, rach.:::['3-19-310']
how was work? oh, great.:::['3-19-311']
although i did sit down where there wasn't a chair.:::['3-19-312']
by the way, ross dropped by a box of your stuff.:::['3-19-313']
oh. well, i guess i had that one coming.:::['3-19-314']
i'm just gonna throw it out. it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...:::['3-19-315']
hmm. no. nothing.:::['3-19-317']
so, uh, what kind of powers would gold man have?:::['3-19-318']
okay. well, he would turn things to gold.:::['3-19-319']
what about things that are already gold? ah. his work is done.:::['3-19-320']
okay, let's play my game.:::['3-19-321']
all right, you yellow-bellied, lily-livered...:::['3-19-323']
yeah, it's fun.:::['3-19-325']
so whose idea was it to put everybody in the diner on skates?:::['3-21-0']
some idiot customer put a suggestion in the suggestion box.:::['3-21-1']
oh, my god. they took my idea. that was you?:::['3-21-2']
okay, there you go.:::['3-21-4']
rachel, i made you a cocoa.:::['3-21-5']
rachel: oh, that's so... aah!:::['3-21-6']
oh, my god. are you guys okay? you all right?:::['3-21-8']
you know, with that goatee, you kind of look like satan.:::['3-21-11']
oh, so that's why the priest threw holy water on me.:::['3-21-12']
okay, listen, you have to cheer up.:::['3-21-13']
okay? you should come out with ross and me.:::['3-21-14']
i mean, anything is better than sitting around here crying all day about kate.:::['3-21-15']
hey, i was crying because...:::['3-21-16']
because nobody believed quincy's theory, okay?:::['3-21-17']
hey. i'm gonna be on tv. chandler: hey.:::['3-21-18']
no way. ross: yeah.:::['3-21-19']
they're putting together this panel to talk about these fossils they found in peru.:::['3-21-20']
the discovery channel's gonna film it. oh, my god. heh. who's gonna watch that?:::['3-21-21']
thanks. you ready to go? chandler: yeah.:::['3-21-22']
ahem, i saw a girl with that vest.:::['3-21-23']
chandler: thanks.:::['3-21-24']
most of us think of chocolate bunnies and baskets as traditional easter gifts.:::['3-21-25']
some people insist on giving live chicks as presents.:::['3-21-26']
unfortunately, the sad fact remains......that most of these little guys:::['3-21-27']
won't live to see the fourth of july.:::['3-21-28']
because as a result of improper care, they will be dead.:::['3-21-29']
you guys got any of those baby chicks?:::['3-21-30']
because i was watching this, uh, commercial on tv......and, man, those things are cute.:::['3-21-31']
hi. monica: hi.:::['3-21-32']
oh, pete, you're back. hey, check this out.:::['3-21-33']
pete: wow. skates. ha, ha.:::['3-21-34']
wow. you're a lot sturdier than chandler. he crumbled like a piece of paper.:::['3-21-36']
so how was your trip?:::['3-21-37']
well... oh, what did you bring me?:::['3-21-38']
aw, hotel toiletries from japan. oh.:::['3-21-39']
these are gonna go in my permanent collection.:::['3-21-40']
you want some coffee? sure, that'd be great.:::['3-21-41']
regular or decaf? pete: ha, ha.:::['3-21-43']
uh, whichever's closest. monica: all right.:::['3-21-44']
okay. so ask me what i did today.:::['3-21-45']
so, what did you do today, pete?:::['3-21-46']
i bought a restaurant, and i would like you to be the chef.:::['3-21-47']
what? oh.:::['3-21-48']
can you believe he just offered me a restaurant?:::['3-21-49']
what a jerk. you want me to kick his ass?:::['3-21-50']
i mean, this has been my dream since i got my first easy-bake oven......and opened easy-monica's bakery.:::['3-21-51']
i mean, i would kill for this job. i mean, i can totally do this job......and god knows i've paid my dues. ugh.:::['3-21-52']
but pete's just doing this because he has a crush on me.:::['3-21-53']
and you're still not attracted to him at all? mm. no.:::['3-21-54']
i mean, how could i accept a restaurant from him? i can't.:::['3-21-55']
i couldn't even accept a necklace from stu vincent in the seventh grade.:::['3-21-56']
yeah, mon, that was totally different. he was your health teacher.:::['3-21-57']
ow. what, honey?:::['3-21-58']
ow, my side still hurts from when you crashed into me yesterday.:::['3-21-59']
oh, god, i'm so sorry. i know. ow.:::['3-21-60']
hey, you guys. guess what. rachel: hey.:::['3-21-62']
got a job on a riverboat?:::['3-21-63']
you know what? i didn't wear this suit for a year because you hated it.:::['3-21-64']
guess what. you're not my girlfriend anymore, so...:::['3-21-65']
oh, i see. so this suit is making a point. ross: mm.:::['3-21-66']
now that you're on your own, you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.:::['3-21-67']
you like it, right?:::['3-21-68']
absolutely. i like it even more on you than i did on colonel sanders.:::['3-21-69']
huh. ross, ross, i'm kidding. come here.:::['3-21-70']
what were you gonna tell us? was it how you invented the cotton gin?:::['3-21-71']
okay, goodbye.:::['3-21-72']
so, um, after you put the suggestion in the box......how long did it take:::['3-21-73']
for the roller-skating thing to happen?:::['3-21-74']
um, about three months.:::['3-21-75']
okay, so i guess that's about, uh, two weeks......before the topless thing kicks in.:::['3-21-76']
i got you something. open it. open it.:::['3-21-78']
it's a chicken.:::['3-21-80']
it's cute, huh?:::['3-21-81']
whoa, whoa, whoa. you guys, do you know anything about chicks?:::['3-21-82']
fowl? no.:::['3-21-83']
women? no.:::['3-21-84']
okay, well, they are a huge responsibility.:::['3-21-85']
especially at this age. they require constant care.:::['3-21-86']
they need just the right food and lots and lots of love.:::['3-21-87']
oh, well, no problem there.:::['3-21-88']
easy, lenny.:::['3-21-89']
so, i mean, have you thought about it?:::['3-21-90']
okay, here's the thing.:::['3-21-91']
oh, no. not "the thing." i hate "the thing.":::['3-21-92']
what's "the thing"?:::['3-21-93']
i'm sorry. i wish i could......but, um, see,you have these feelings for me.:::['3-21-95']
wait, wait, wait. that's what you're worried about?:::['3-21-96']
if that's the problem, we've got no problem.:::['3-21-97']
huh? no. i was gonna tell you this over dinner, but i met somebody else, on my trip.:::['3-21-98']
her name's ann. she's a journalist. uh, we met on the plane.:::['3-21-100']
she asked me if she could finish off my peanuts.:::['3-21-101']
i thought she said something else. we had a big laugh.:::['3-21-102']
yeah, i just... i mean, i got tired of waiting.:::['3-21-103']
oh, that's great. i mean, i'm sorry, but i'm so happy for you.:::['3-21-104']
and now i can work for you. i guess you can.:::['3-21-105']
oh, my god. oh, this is incredible. oh.:::['3-21-106']
all right. you know what? i'm just gonna roll right into that office and quit.:::['3-21-107']
could you give me a little push? yeah, sure.:::['3-21-109']
good luck. monica: i'm quitting. woo-hoo!:::['3-21-110']
i'm okay. i'm all right.:::['3-21-111']
wow. that's exciting. you went to japan, made up a woman.:::['3-21-112']
i'm just saying, this woman, i mean, she's fictitious, no?:::['3-21-114']
why would you say that? you're still into monica.:::['3-21-115']
so you told her there's somebody else so she'd agree to work with you.:::['3-21-116']
because you figure, if you spend time together, maybe something might happen.:::['3-21-117']
you're good. you're good.:::['3-21-118']
yeah. no, i'm fairly intuitive. and psychic.:::['3-21-119']
it's a substantial gift.:::['3-21-120']
listen, can you promise me that you won't tell her, though?:::['3-21-121']
absolutely. oh, i promise. tell her what?:::['3-21-122']
thanks a lot.:::['3-21-123', '3-3-53']
no, i'm serious. i mean, i'm intuitive, but my memory sucks.:::['3-21-124']
chandler: okay, but this is the last time.:::['3-21-125']
and a chick-chick there:::['3-21-126']
here a chick, there a chick everywhere a chick-chick:::['3-21-127']
chicken:::['3-21-128']
how's she doing?:::['3-21-130']
she?:::['3-21-131']
well, yeah. don't you think it's a she?:::['3-21-132']
i can't tell. whatever it was, went back in too quickly.:::['3-21-134']
anyway, i gotta change. i'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.:::['3-21-135']
i stayed home from work while you were at rehearsal......so somebody could be here:::['3-21-138']
with our chick.:::['3-21-139']
hey. who was up from 2:00 this morning until 5:00 this morning......trying to get her back to sleep?:::['3-21-140']
you don't think i get up when you get up?:::['3-21-141']
oh, here it comes.:::['3-21-142']
yes. here it comes. i'm stuck here all day.:::['3-21-143']
and then you come in and spend two seconds with us......and then expect to go off:::['3-21-144']
gallivanting with your friends?:::['3-21-145']
well, i don't think so, mister.:::['3-21-146']
hey. i need to relax, okay? i was working all day.:::['3-21-147']
and you don't think taking care of our chick is work?:::['3-21-148']
that's not what i said. okay, i just meant...:::['3-21-149']
i know what you meant.:::['3-21-150']
did you notice that ever since we got this chick......we've been fighting:::['3-21-151']
a lot more than we used to?:::['3-21-152']
i don't know, maybe we weren't ready to have a chick.:::['3-21-153']
i'll take her back tomorrow.:::['3-21-154']
you think we'll get our 3 bucks back?:::['3-21-155']
hey. joey & chandler: hey.:::['3-21-156']
oh. hey.:::['3-21-157']
listen, i have that tv thing in, like, two hours, and i need your help.:::['3-21-158']
okay, what do you think? this blue suit or this brown one?:::['3-21-159']
well, the brown one brings out your eyes.:::['3-21-160']
but your butt looks great in the blue one.:::['3-21-161']
wow. that aspirin dance really works.:::['3-21-164']
rachel: ow. oh, my god. is that still? i'm fine. i'm fine.:::['3-21-165']
no, you're not. yes, i am.:::['3-21-166']
rach. look, i'm fine.:::['3-21-167']
watch. look at that. uh-oh.:::['3-21-168']
okay, okay. look, you've got to go to a doctor, okay?:::['3-21-169']
no, i have to get ready and go to a dinner at my boss's house.:::['3-21-170']
very big deal. there's people there that i have to meet.:::['3-21-171']
yeah, and i'm sure you're gonna make a great impression. "hi, i'm rachel.:::['3-21-172']
it's nice to meet you.":::['3-21-173']
come on, you probably have a broken rib.:::['3-21-174']
well, i will go to the hospital tomorrow. it'll still be broken then.:::['3-21-175']
but you know, i could use a hand getting ready.:::['3-21-176']
rachel. look, either help me or go.:::['3-21-177']
fine. i'll go.:::['3-21-178']
okay, but before you go, could you help me first?:::['3-21-179']

ooh, i have to tell you something.:::['3-21-208']
what? well, i can't tell you.:::['3-21-209']
okay, but wouldn't it be easier to tell me something that you could tell me?:::['3-21-210']
well, sure, in a perfect world.:::['3-21-211']
but no. i promised i wouldn't tell, and i swore to, like, all my gods.:::['3-21-212']
does it have to do with ross and rachel?:::['3-21-214']
does it have to do with joey? no.:::['3-21-216']
does it have to do with chandler and that sock that he keeps by his bed?:::['3-21-217']
no, but let's come back to that later.:::['3-21-218']
there you go. good enough for your party? huh?:::['3-21-219']
sure. i'll just sit next to the transsexual from purchasing.:::['3-21-221']
okay, come on. all right, i gotta go. so good luck at the party, okay?:::['3-21-223']
oh, wait, ross. could you just stay and help me get dressed?:::['3-21-224']
okay. okay, great. um, okay, just turn around.:::['3-21-226']
what? i don't want you to see me naked.:::['3-21-227']
rachel, i've seen you naked a million times. i ate hot fudge off you naked.:::['3-21-228']
i sucked that mini-marshmallow out of your bellybutton.:::['3-21-229']
yeah, but that was different, you know? we were going out then.:::['3-21-230']
now it's weird.:::['3-21-231']
rach, you know, i can see you naked anytime i want.:::['3-21-232']
all i have to do is close my eyes. see? woo-hoo.:::['3-21-234']
ross, stop that. i'm sorry.:::['3-21-235']
come on. i don't want you thinking of me like that anymore.:::['3-21-236']
uh, sorry. nothing you can do about it.:::['3-21-237']
it's one of my, uh, rights as the ex-boyfriend.:::['3-21-238']
huh? oh. oh, yeah.:::['3-21-239']
stop it. cut it out. cut it out. okay, okay.:::['3-21-240']
i'm sorry. it will never happen... uh-oh.:::['3-21-241']
wait a minute. wait, wait...:::['3-21-242']
now there are a hundred of you, and i'm the king.:::['3-21-243']
ross... oh, come on.:::['3-21-244']
would you grow up? it's no big deal.:::['3-21-245']
yowza. okay.:::['3-21-247']
see what you did? i'm gonna be doing it by myself now.:::['3-21-248']
okay, that's it. ow! oh, come on.:::['3-21-249']
oh, my god. all right, look, look, okay.:::['3-21-250']
rach. easy. easy. you have to go to the hospital, okay?:::['3-21-251']
okay, i do. i really do. okay.:::['3-21-252']
okay, i'm gonna get your coat, then i'll put you in a cab.:::['3-21-253']
oh, wait, wait, you're not gonna come with me?:::['3-21-254']
uh, i just have to make a call.:::['3-21-256']
i'm sorry. i just can't go to the hospital looking like this.:::['3-21-261']
does it involve travel? no.:::['3-21-262']
does it involve clogs?:::['3-21-263']
wait, wait. clogs or claws?:::['3-21-264']
clogs. no.:::['3-21-265']
claws? no.:::['3-21-266']
okay, so it doesn't involve ross or rachel or chandler or joey.:::['3-21-267']
what about pete? no.:::['3-21-268']
what about pete? i don't know.:::['3-21-270']
okay, i feel like i'm talking to lassie.:::['3-21-271']
phoebe, would you just tell me? i can't.:::['3-21-272']
okay, you know, i gotta go. but you're so close. no.:::['3-21-273']
something to do with pete's company?:::['3-21-274']
ugh. just go. you're never gonna get it.:::['3-21-275']
see, yes. that's yasmine bleeth.:::['3-21-277']
she's a completely different kind of chick.:::['3-21-278']
but in very different ways.:::['3-21-280']
ooh. ah.:::['3-21-282']
what are you doing? i though you were gonna take her back.:::['3-21-283']
i did. but the store wouldn't take her back.:::['3-21-284']
so then i took her to the shelter. and you know what i found out?:::['3-21-285']
if they can't find a home for her, they kill her.:::['3-21-286']
and i'm not gonna let that happen to little yasmine.:::['3-21-287']
okay, good, good, good.:::['3-21-288']
because i was kind of having second thoughts too.:::['3-21-289']
okay. and it's not just chicks, you know? it's all kinds of other animals.:::['3-21-290']
that's horrible. well, you did the right thing, man.:::['3-21-291']
thanks. i'm glad you see it that way.:::['3-21-292']
oh, funny story.:::['3-21-293']
wow, look at this refrigerator. it's gigantic.:::['3-21-295']
i mean, i could live in this thing. i'd be cold, but i'm always cold.:::['3-21-296']
oh, my god. look at these spider burners. i love spider burners.:::['3-21-297']
so you like it?:::['3-21-298']
oh, it is so perfect. thank you so much.:::['3-21-299']
you're welcome. oh.:::['3-21-300']
did you just smell my hair?:::['3-21-301']
no. no way. what? no.:::['3-21-302']
oh, god. what?:::['3-21-303']
you still have feelings for me, don't you?:::['3-21-304']
no. i'm just excited about the restaurant, that's all.:::['3-21-305']
pete? okay, i love you. is that so bad?:::['3-21-306']
no, it's not bad. it's not bad at all.:::['3-21-307']
it's really nice.:::['3-21-308']
look, the only one who stands to get hurt is me, and i'm okay with that.:::['3-21-309']
yeah, you may be okay with getting hurt......but i am not okay with being:::['3-21-310']
the one who hurts you.:::['3-21-311']
that's why i can't take this job. what?:::['3-21-312']
well, we probably shouldn't see each other anymore.:::['3-21-313']
i mean, if that's really what you want, okay.:::['3-21-316']
i'm sorry things didn't work out...:::['3-21-318']
shut up for a second and let me just see something.:::['3-21-319']
okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?:::['3-21-321']
rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray. okay.:::['3-21-322']
hey, now, you stay out here and you think about what you did.:::['3-21-323']
that's a duck. that's a bad duck.:::['3-21-324']
how'd the thing go tonight, ross? oh, it was... no, no.:::['3-21-325']
what thing? what thing?:::['3-21-326']
nothing. there was this thing at the museum. come on.:::['3-21-327']
okay, now, when you come back......i hope you remember:::['3-21-329']
that that chick is not a toy.:::['3-21-330']
what thing? what is this thing?:::['3-21-331']
aw, i was kind of supposed to be on tv tonight for the discovery channel.:::['3-21-332']
ross, why didn't you tell me that?:::['3-21-334']
ah, i knew that if i told you, you'd make me go......and i knew you needed someone:::['3-21-335']
to be with you tonight. come on.:::['3-21-336']
come on. i cannot believe you.:::['3-21-337']
what? that is the sweetest thing.:::['3-21-338']
you should get some sleep.:::['3-21-339']
so i'll, um... i'm sorry i spoiled your evening.:::['3-21-341']
no, that's... no, as long as you're okay.:::['3-21-342']
so i'll, uh... i'll see you tomorrow.:::['3-21-343']
what did you do?:::['3-21-346']
joey: what you doing?:::['3-21-347']
having a swim.:::['3-21-348']
what about the chick?:::['3-21-349']
chicks don't swim.:::['3-21-350']
should we try? sure.:::['3-21-353']
see, i told you. they don't swim.:::['3-21-354']
well, give him a minute. no.:::['3-21-355']
oh, it's okay. it's okay, baby, baby, baby.:::['3-21-356']
wait a minute. you're telling me this actress person......is the only woman you ever wanted:::['3-20-0']
who didn't want you back?:::['3-20-1']
is this what it's like to be you?:::['3-20-4']
wow, you're really crazy about her, huh? oh. you have no idea.:::['3-20-5']
and when we're on-stage, i get to kiss her and touch her.:::['3-20-6']
but then she goes home with the director......and it's like somebody's:::['3-20-7']
ripping out my heart.:::['3-20-8']
oh, it's so great to see you feeling like this.:::['3-20-9']
monica, uh, dad called this morning......and, uh, aunt sylvia passed away.:::['3-20-11']
yes. yes. yeah, yeah, yeah.:::['3-20-12']
we were all pretty shaken up about it.:::['3-20-13']
wait, am i missing something?:::['3-20-14']
because i always thought death was supposed to be sad, in a way.:::['3-20-15']
well, uh, aunt sylvia was......well, not a nice person.:::['3-20-16']
no, she was a cruel, cranky old bitch.:::['3-20-17']
and i'm sorry she died.:::['3-20-18']
did dad say i get the dollhouse?:::['3-20-19']
you get the dollhouse. i get the dollhouse.:::['3-20-20']
wow. a house for dolls. that is so cool.:::['3-20-21']
when i was a kid, i had a barrel.:::['3-20-22']
uh, pheebs, you had a barrel for a dollhouse?:::['3-20-23']
no, just a barrel.:::['3-20-24']
you know what? you can play with my dollhouse.:::['3-20-25']
really? really? any time you want.:::['3-20-26']
when i was younger, all i wanted to do was to play with this dollhouse.:::['3-20-27']
but no. it was to be looked at, but never played with.:::['3-20-28']
my grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me.:::['3-20-29']
hey, sophie. hey, rach.:::['3-20-30']
thanks for lunch, chandler. you didn't have to walk me here.:::['3-20-32']
oh, that's okay. no problem.:::['3-20-33']
honey, you do realize we don't keep the women's lingerie here in the office.:::['3-20-34']
yes, i realize that.:::['3-20-35']
summer catalog. that's the stuff.:::['3-20-36']
rachel, i need the versace invoice.:::['3-20-37']
hello. you don't work for me.:::['3-20-38']
rachel: joanna, this is my friend chandler bing. joanna.:::['3-20-39']

rachel: bye, chandler.:::['3-20-43']
so, uh, what's wrong with him?:::['3-20-44']
oh, nothing. he's just goofy like that. i actually hardly notice it anymore.:::['3-20-45']
oh, no, no, no. i mean, is he, um, married or involved with anyone?:::['3-20-46']
no, no. he's not married or involved with anyone.:::['3-20-47']
oh, rachel...:::['3-20-48']
actually, you know what? forget it.:::['3-20-49']
i'll ask him for you if you want me to. joanna: would you?:::['3-20-50']
or is it just too sad and desperate......you know,something that sophie would do?:::['3-20-51']
i am here. i know that.:::['3-20-52']
look at it.:::['3-20-53']
wallpaper's a little faded. that's okay.:::['3-20-55']
carpet's a little loose.:::['3-20-56']
hardwood floors?:::['3-20-57']
hey. oh! chandler: hello.:::['3-20-58']

so i'm here, ready to play. hee-hee. okay.:::['3-20-61']
i brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. ha, ha.:::['3-20-62']
that's a dog. every house should have a dog.:::['3-20-64']
not one that can pee on the roof.:::['3-20-65']
well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste.:::['3-20-66']
and is this in case the house sneezes?:::['3-20-67']
no. no, that's the ghost for the attic.:::['3-20-68']
i don't want a ghost. well, nobody wants a ghost.:::['3-20-69']
but you've got one......because the house is sitting on:::['3-20-70']
an ancient indian burial ground.:::['3-20-71']
wait a minute. the house was built on radioactive waste......and an ancient indian burial ground?:::['3-20-72']
ha, ha. that would never happen.:::['3-20-73']
okay, obviously you don't know much about the u.s. government. ha, ha.:::['3-20-74']
i need to talk to you. sure. what's up?:::['3-20-76']
oh, sorry. i meant chandler.:::['3-20-77']
well, if something comes up...:::['3-20-79']
well, i'm glad you guys are past that little awkward phase.:::['3-20-80']
okay. my boss, joanna. when you left......she started asking questions:::['3-20-81']
about you.:::['3-20-82']
ha, ha. liked what she saw, huh?:::['3-20-83']
dug my action, did she?:::['3-20-84']
checking out the chan chan man.:::['3-20-85']
that was......surreal.:::['3-20-86']
okay, what do you think? you interested at all?:::['3-20-87']
yeah, she seemed cool, attractive. i'll do it.:::['3-20-88']
oh, thank you, chandler. this is great. she's gonna love me.:::['3-20-89']
okay, dinosaur attack. quick, everybody into the house. aah!:::['3-20-90']
all right, phoebe, you know what? that's it. that's it. all right?:::['3-20-91']
no dinosaurs, no ghosts, no giant dogs, okay?:::['3-20-92']
they're not the right size, they're not victorian, and they just don't go.:::['3-20-93']
okay. fine.:::['3-20-94']
come, dinosaur. we're not welcome in the house of no imagination.:::['3-20-95']
uh, pheebs, while we're hovering around the subject......i just have to say that dinosaurs,they don't go, "ruff.":::['3-20-96']
the little ones do.:::['3-20-97']
joey: hey, kate. morning.:::['3-20-98']

man: hey, lovely.:::['3-20-100']

and i ate the food. it was good. i had the fish.:::['3-20-102']
yeah, it was pretty good. yeah.:::['3-20-103']
i'm lauren. kate's understudy.:::['3-20-105']
oh. hey. joey tribbiani.:::['3-20-106']
i know. i'm a big fan of yours.:::['3-20-107']
i used to, um, schedule my classes so i could watch dr. drake ramoray......on days of our lives.:::['3-20-109']
get out of here. really?:::['3-20-110']
absolutely. huh.:::['3-20-111']
oh, but then they went and dropped you down that elevator shaft.:::['3-20-112']
yeah, they gave me the shaft, all right.:::['3-20-113']
listen, um, what are you doing after rehearsal?:::['3-20-115']
do you wanna get a drink or something?:::['3-20-116']
yeah. yeah, sure. a drink sounds great.:::['3-20-118']

all right. it's time to act, my talking props.:::['3-20-120']
hey. ross & rachel: hey.:::['3-20-121']
look, everybody. look at my new dollhouse.:::['3-20-122']
ross & rachel: wow.:::['3-20-123']
ha, ha. look, look.:::['3-20-124']
ross: hey, what's this?:::['3-20-125']
oh, okay. it's a slide instead of stairs. look.:::['3-20-126']
very interesting, phoebe.:::['3-20-128']
rachel: what's this?:::['3-20-129']
the licorice room. you can eat all the furniture.:::['3-20-130']
and when guests come over, they can stay on the tootsie roll-away bed.:::['3-20-131']
this is the coolest house ever.:::['3-20-132']
hey. does anyone want to join me in the aroma room?:::['3-20-133']
rachel: all right. ross: i would.:::['3-20-134']
monica: hey, guys? guys.:::['3-20-135']
did you see my new china cabinet?:::['3-20-136']
both: uh-huh.:::['3-20-137']
watch. watch.:::['3-20-138']
ross & rachel: ooh. and? and?:::['3-20-139']
hey, my father's house does that.:::['3-20-140']
okay, how did it go? tell me everything.:::['3-20-141']
well, the movie was great......dinner was great, and there's nothing:::['3-20-142']
like a cool, crisp new york evening.:::['3-20-143']
of course, i didn't get to enjoy any of that because joanna's such a big dull dud.:::['3-20-144']
chandler is fantastic.:::['3-20-145']
what? oh, god. you know how people just click?:::['3-20-146']
like, he came by to pick me up. i opened the door, and it was just like, "click.":::['3-20-147']
did he tell you? well...:::['3-20-148']
oh, and he's got such a good heart. doesn't he have a good heart?:::['3-20-149']
oh, i know. and he's so sweet.:::['3-20-150']
he said he'd call, so put him straight through.:::['3-20-151']
isn't this great? don't spoil it.:::['3-20-152']
come on, baby, don't go. please?:::['3-20-153']
hello? oh!:::['3-20-155']
it's you. just, uh... just one sec.:::['3-20-156']
i am going to take this call.:::['3-20-157']
when i continue, i hope that there will appear on-stage......this magical thing:::['3-20-158']
that in the theater we call......committing to the moment.:::['3-20-159']
the guy's like a cartoon.:::['3-20-160']
what do you see in him, anyway?:::['3-20-161']
he happens to be brilliant.:::['3-20-162']
which is more than i can say for that sweater you're dating.:::['3-20-163']
hey, i'm not interested in her sweater.:::['3-20-164']
it's what's underneath her sweater that counts.:::['3-20-165']
and besides, since, uh...:::['3-20-166']
since when do you care who i'm going out with?:::['3-20-167']
i don't care. why? do you want me to care?:::['3-20-168']
heh. do you want me to want you to care?:::['3-20-169']
okay. i'm afraid to say this, but let's pick it up where we left off.:::['3-20-172']
come on, baby, don't go. please? what do you say?:::['3-20-173']
i've got no reason to stay.:::['3-20-174']
stop it. you must stop.:::['3-20-176']
you are bad actors.:::['3-20-177']
this is a terrible play.:::['3-20-178']
i'll see you in the morning.:::['3-20-179']
i can't believe we go on in a week.:::['3-20-180']
hey, it's gonna be all right. lauren: hey.:::['3-20-181']
so since we're getting off early, do you want to go and paint mugs?:::['3-20-182']
you know, at that place i told you about last night?:::['3-20-184']
oh, yeah, with the mug-painting. yeah.:::['3-20-185']
i was so listening to that. lauren: ha, ha.:::['3-20-186']
but, uh, you know what? i think i need to work on my stuff tonight.:::['3-20-187']
oh, okay. joey: okay.:::['3-20-188']
i'll see you tomorrow. joey: okay.:::['3-20-189']
okay. ha, ha. lauren: night.:::['3-20-190']
like, what are we gonna do about the scene, huh?:::['3-20-193']
maybe if it had more heat.:::['3-20-196']
well, how do you mean?:::['3-20-197']
well, adrianne's looking for a reason to stay, right?:::['3-20-198']
victor can't just kiss her. he's gotta...:::['3-20-199']
he's gotta really give her a reason, you know?:::['3-20-200']
maybe he could slip her the tongue.:::['3-20-201']
or maybe...:::['3-20-202']
maybe he could grab her and lift her up.:::['3-20-203']
yeah, yeah. then adrianne, maybe she could wrap her legs around his waist.:::['3-20-204']
and then she could rip off his shirt and kiss his chest and his stomach.:::['3-20-205']
and then he could use his teeth, his teeth, to undo her dress and...:::['3-20-206']
and bite her.:::['3-20-207']
and then right when the scene ends, he could take her......with this raw, animal...:::['3-20-208']
something like that?:::['3-20-209']
yeah, that's pretty much what i had in mind.:::['3-20-210']
it's a little early to be drinking.:::['3-20-213']
things, uh, finally happened with kate.:::['3-20-214']
oh. that's great. you're kidding. that's great.:::['3-20-215']
oh, it was so amazing.:::['3-20-216']
after the lovemaking...:::['3-20-217']
i just watched her sleep for, like, hours.:::['3-20-219']
just breathing in... ross: huh.:::['3-20-220']
...and breathing out.:::['3-20-221']
and i knew she was dreaming because her eyes kept going like this::::['3-20-222']
i'm telling you, joanna's got it all wrong, okay?:::['3-20-223']
all i said was, "this was fun. let's do it again sometime.:::['3-20-224']
i'll give you a call.":::['3-20-225']
oh, gee...:::['3-20-226']
i wonder why she thinks you're going to call her?:::['3-20-227']
that's what you say at the end of a date.:::['3-20-228']
you can't just say, "nice to meet you. good night"?:::['3-20-229']
to her face?:::['3-20-230']
it's the end of the date, i'm standing there......she's waiting for me to say:::['3-20-231']
i'll call her......and it just, you know, comes out.:::['3-20-232']
i can't help it.:::['3-20-233']
it's a compulsion.:::['3-20-234']
come on, rach, when a guy says he's gonna call......it doesn't mean he's going to call.:::['3-20-235']
this never happened to you?:::['3-20-236']
well, they always called.:::['3-20-237']
bite me.:::['3-20-238']
did he call? no, sorry.:::['3-20-239']
why? why? he said he'd call. why hasn't he called?:::['3-20-240']
maybe he's intimidated by really smart, strong, successful women.:::['3-20-241']
sophie, will you please climb out of my butt.:::['3-20-242']
why hasn't he called, rachel? why? okay, okay.:::['3-20-243']
um, well, uh, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.:::['3-20-244']
awkward? why should he feel awkward?:::['3-20-245']
the only person that should feel awkward is you. you didn't tell him not to call me?:::['3-20-246']
if you're uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for......there are always ways to fix that.:::['3-20-247']
call her. call her now.:::['3-20-249']
multiple, so many paper cuts.:::['3-20-250']
"why hasn't he called, rachel? why? why?:::['3-20-251']
i don't understand. he said he'd call.":::['3-20-252']
chandler, i'm telling you, she's flipped out. she's gone crazy.:::['3-20-253']
oh. well, give me the phone, then.:::['3-20-254']
this isn't funny. she thinks it's my fault you haven't called her.:::['3-20-255']
you have to call her.:::['3-20-256']
look, you can't call somebody after this long just to say::::['3-20-257']
"in case you didn't notice, i don't like you.":::['3-20-258']
then you're gonna have to take her out again.:::['3-20-259']
no. she's really dull, and she gets this......gross mascara-goop thing:::['3-20-260']
in the corner of her eye.:::['3-20-261']
you'll take her out again and end it......and end it in a way:::['3-20-263']
that she knows it's actually ended.:::['3-20-264']
and i don't care how hard it is for you. do not tell her you'll call her again.:::['3-20-265']
but it's just a lunch date. from now on, i get my own dates.:::['3-20-267']
i don't want you setting me up with anybody again.:::['3-20-268']
that's just a lot of big talk, you know. i know.:::['3-20-270']
monica: i'm in the shower.:::['3-20-272']
aah! fire. there's a fire. fire.:::['3-20-273']
so i, uh, talked to lauren. i kind of told her how things were with us.:::['3-20-275']
did you, uh...? did you talk to marshall?:::['3-20-276']
ha, ha. you know, about what happened with us.:::['3-20-278']
and there's really no reason why he should find out.:::['3-20-280']
so, uh, let's not make a big deal out of it, okay?:::['3-20-281']
it was a big deal.:::['3-20-283']
i mean, come on, you can't tell me last night didn't mean something to you.:::['3-20-284']
i was there. you're not that good an actress.:::['3-20-285']
um, i was... i was just caught up in the moment.:::['3-20-287']
that's all it was.:::['3-20-288']
joey, i'm sorry you feel bad......but haven't you ever slept with a woman:::['3-20-289']
where it meant more to her than to you?:::['3-20-290']
hi, kate. kate: hi, lauren.:::['3-20-292']
hi, lauren.:::['3-20-293']
hi, pig.:::['3-20-294']
sorry i, uh... i scared you in there.:::['3-20-295']
by the way......i was just checking:::['3-20-297']
the shower massager.:::['3-20-298']
i tried to reach you at work.:::['3-20-301']
there's been a fire.:::['3-20-302']
well, we believe it originated here......in the aroma room.:::['3-20-305']
all right, did everyone get out okay?:::['3-20-306']
well, the giraffe's okay and so is the pirate.:::['3-20-307']
what is this? no, phoebe, don't look.:::['3-20-308']
you don't want to see what's under there.:::['3-20-309']
the foster puppets.:::['3-20-310']
it's not a big deal.:::['3-20-311']
it's just... it's right here, and it's all the time.:::['3-20-312']
well, thanks again for lunch.:::['3-20-313']
yes, this was pleasant. it was, wasn't it?:::['3-20-314']
the food there was great. wasn't it?:::['3-20-315']
so take care.:::['3-20-316']
this was great. i'll give you a call. we should do it again.:::['3-20-318']
joanna: great. i'm looking forward to it.:::['3-20-319']
rachel, any messages? rachel: sophie's desk.:::['3-20-320']
chandler. are you gonna call her?:::['3-20-321']
look, i'm sorry, okay? i'm weak and pathetic and sorry.:::['3-20-323']
okay, you are gonna tell her. you're gonna tell her now.:::['3-20-324']
ow, i'm not gonna call you.:::['3-20-325']
i'm sorry that i said i was going to when i'm not.:::['3-20-328']
ugh. look, this has nothing to do with you.:::['3-20-329']
and this isn't rachel's fault. it's me.:::['3-20-330']
i have serious, serious problems when it comes to women.:::['3-20-331']
i have issues with commitment, intimacy......mascara goop.:::['3-20-332']
and i'm really sorry. it's just that this is not... this isn't gonna work out.:::['3-20-333']
well, this isn't how i was hoping this would end......but i guess i have to appreciate:::['3-20-334']
your honesty.:::['3-20-335']
well, this is great. i'll give you a call. we should do it again sometime.:::['3-20-338']
wha... so anyway, beth, what i'm saying is......i should have considered your feelings:::['3-20-339']
before i went home with you that night.:::['3-20-340']
i've, uh...:::['3-20-341']
i've recently learned what it's like to be on your side of it... ...and i'm sorry.:::['3-20-342']
so do you think you can forgive me?:::['3-20-343']
hello, jennifer?:::['3-20-347']
oh, hi, mrs. laurio. is jennifer there?:::['3-20-348']

uh. huh.:::['3-22-78']
i think you may be in our seats.:::['3-22-80']

what are you, a moron? huh? it says, "d-13." okay?:::['3-22-86']
look, you're surrounded by even numbers. does that give you some clue?:::['3-22-87']
well, the usher told me... oh. oh, the usher must be right.:::['3-22-88']
what, with all his training they go through. get out!:::['3-22-89']
hey, man, you want the aisle? no, i'm good.:::['3-22-91']
chandler: there he is. rachel: there's our star.:::['3-22-92']
you were great.:::['3-22-93']
so? so? what'd you think?:::['3-22-94']
almost as good as the play with the two naked girls on the seesaw.:::['3-22-95']
i wasn't in that. i know.:::['3-22-96']
hey, kate, listen i want you to meet everybody. everybody, this is kate.:::['3-22-97']
excuse me. excuse me. sweetheart. hi.:::['3-22-98']

so that's the girl you like.:::['3-22-100']
i'm telling you, this guy rachel is with is crazy, okay?:::['3-22-101']
he viciously screamed at total strangers.:::['3-22-102']
i think he's bad news.:::['3-22-103']
wait a minute, wait a minute. you don't like the guy rachel's dating?:::['3-22-104']
well, that's odd.:::['3-22-105']

hi. hey, gosh, you look so familiar.:::['3-22-107']

it was right after i slept with joey. he dumped me the next day.:::['3-22-109']
so how'd you guys meet?:::['3-22-110']
well, uh, the short version is, i pursued her for a couple of months.:::['3-22-111']
then i gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.:::['3-22-112']
yeah, and in the long version, i dump him for telling people the short version.:::['3-22-113']
joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous.:::['3-22-114']
hey, you guys, this is my agent, estelle.:::['3-22-115']
oh, you two girls were outstanding.:::['3-22-117']

they weren't in the play.:::['3-22-119']
huh. we're not actors. estelle: oh. what a shame.:::['3-22-120']
because with her face and her chest......i could really put something together.:::['3-22-121']
could i borrow it?:::['3-22-122']
hi. remember me?:::['3-22-123']
hi. yeah. ahem, tommy's in line for the bathroom......and someone just cut in front of him.:::['3-22-124']
i think he's gonna snap.:::['3-22-125']
ross, i'm gonna go. go? why?:::['3-22-126']
i don't know. could be because i don't feel like......standing around all night, waiting:::['3-22-127']
for some guy who may or may not scream.:::['3-22-128']
oh, but cailin......he definitely will scream.:::['3-22-129']

you know what you should do? become a drama critic.:::['3-22-158']
i am hurt.:::['3-22-159']
a plague......on both your houses.:::['3-22-160']

how much we connected, you know?:::['3-22-213']
then she passed out.:::['3-22-214']
but then she woke up. yeah.:::['3-22-215']
and we stayed up all night talking.:::['3-22-216']
and now we're, like, totally crazy about each other.:::['3-22-217']
joey, you had "the night." what?:::['3-22-218']
when two people finally realize their feelings for each other......and they talk for hours and they learn:::['3-22-219']
all about the other person.:::['3-22-220']
ha, ha. did you learn about her family? two brothers. one died.:::['3-22-222']
yes. joey: yeah.:::['3-22-223']

hmm. or maybe i should stay away from all men.:::['3-22-235']

phoebe, 800 is toll free. 801 is utah.:::['3-22-334']
it has to be 800 because all those big companies have 800 numbers.:::['3-22-336']
every...:::['3-22-337']
yeah, every big utah-based company has one.:::['3-22-338']
sorry. i'm so sorry. i will pay you back.:::['3-22-340']

well, i think i broke it.:::['3-22-346']
but that's all right. here's the number where you can call.:::['3-22-347']
hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck and our chick had a little baby?:::['3-23-0']
we could call it chuck.:::['3-23-1']
or dick.:::['3-23-2']
hey. chandler & joey: hey.:::['3-23-3']
listen, i need a favor.:::['3-23-4']
i was in the shower, and as i was......cleansing myself, i, uh...:::['3-23-5']
well, i felt something.:::['3-23-6']
was it like a sneeze, only better?:::['3-23-7']
no, no. i mean, like, a thing on my body.:::['3-23-8']
well, what was it?:::['3-23-9']
well, i don't know. it's kind of in a place that's not...:::['3-23-10']
it's not visually accessible to me. and i was hoping maybe you guys......could help me out.:::['3-23-11']
whoa! whoa! no.:::['3-23-12']
come on, you guys. it's no big deal.:::['3-23-13']
both: hey, hey, hey.:::['3-23-14']
well, what is it? is it a mole?:::['3-23-16']
no, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.:::['3-23-17']
ew. is it...? what, a pimple?:::['3-23-18']
no, it's......fancier than a pimple.:::['3-23-19']
look, ross, just go see a doc... guys, what's...?:::['3-23-20']
okay, well, it's definite. two more weeks of winter.:::['3-23-21']
yeah, right. ah.:::['3-23-22']
and, um, this is the coffeehouse. this is where i play my music.:::['3-23-23']
good deal. yeah, and these are my friends.:::['3-23-24']
people? this is vince. vince, the people.:::['3-23-25']
hey. vince is a fireman.:::['3-23-27']
wow. have you ever rescued anyone from a burning building before?:::['3-23-28']
ninety-eight hot saves. highest on the force.:::['3-23-29']
well, you know, if joey and i play with matches......we could get you up to an even 100.:::['3-23-30']
fire safety is not a joke, son. ha, ha. oh.:::['3-23-31']
you're right. i know.:::['3-23-32']
look, i gotta go. i'm on call tonight.:::['3-23-33']
see you saturday. okay.:::['3-23-34']
wow, he's cute, pheebs.:::['3-23-35']
but i thought you just started dating that teacher.:::['3-23-36']
oh, jason? rachel: yeah.:::['3-23-37']
uh-huh. we're seeing each other tonight.ahem.:::['3-23-38']
well, pheebs?:::['3-23-39']
two dates in one day? that's so unlike you.:::['3-23-40']
i know, i know. i'm, like, playing the field, you know?:::['3-23-41']
i'm juggling two guys. i'm sowing my wild oats, you know?:::['3-23-42']
you know, this kind of, like, you know, oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.:::['3-23-43']
so, pheebs, do they know about each other?:::['3-23-44']
does a dog's lips move when he reads?:::['3-23-45']
okay, no, they don't know.:::['3-23-46']
hey, guys. all: hi.:::['3-23-47']
joey: well? how'd it go at the doctor's?:::['3-23-48']
well, he said there's definitely nothing to worry about. it's totally benign.:::['3-23-49']
well, what is it? he couldn't even tell me.:::['3-23-50']
he said it was just some sort of skin abnormality.:::['3-23-51']
and the worse thing is, he said not being able to identify it......he was reluctant to remove it.:::['3-23-52']
you know what? you should go to my guy.:::['3-23-53']
because when i went in there with my third nipple......he just lopped it right off, you know?:::['3-23-54']
so i guess i'm lucky. heh.:::['3-23-56']
i mean, not as lucky as people who are born with two nipples.:::['3-23-57']
at least they knew what yours was. you know? yours had a name.:::['3-23-58']
oh. maybe they'll name yours after you.:::['3-23-59']
you know? they'd call it the ross.:::['3-23-60']
and then people would be, like, "oh, he's got a ross.":::['3-23-61']
yeah, that'd be cool.:::['3-23-62']
pete's breaking up with me.:::['3-23-63']
yeah, i just checked my messages.:::['3-23-65']
he said that when he gets back from atlanta, "we need to talk.":::['3-23-66']
and? monica: well, that's it.:::['3-23-67']
people never say, "we need to talk," unless it's something bad.:::['3-23-68']
whoa. that doesn't necessarily mean he's breaking up with you.:::['3-23-69']
phoebe: yeah. really?:::['3-23-70']
yeah. maybe he just cheated on you.:::['3-23-71']
and i know i'll never get rich doing it, but i gotta tell you, it's pretty cool......knowing you're making:::['3-23-72']
a difference in a kid's life.:::['3-23-73']
that is so great.:::['3-23-74']
oh, my god! ooh.:::['3-23-76']
uh, we'd better call the fire department. no. no.:::['3-23-77']
no, no? well, we don't need a fireman.:::['3-23-78']
we need, like, a good mechanic.:::['3-23-79']
oh, my god. here they come. we gotta get out of here.:::['3-23-80']
wait. why?:::['3-23-81']
look, if i wanted to see a fireman, i would date one, okay?:::['3-23-82']
that's all it is, a third nipple.:::['3-23-83']
you know? just your run-of-the-mill third nipple. yeah.:::['3-23-84']
you can take it off. just slice that baby right off.:::['3-23-85']
take your shirt off and let's see what we're dealing with here.:::['3-23-86']
just showing you my run-of-the-mill, slice-it-right-off third nipple.:::['3-23-88']
well, that's not a third nipple. oh?:::['3-23-89']
first of all, it's on your ass.:::['3-23-90']
well, then what is it?:::['3-23-91']
wait a minute. hold it.:::['3-23-92']
jansen, will you come in here a moment? jansen: i'm with hamilton.:::['3-23-93']
he's good with weird things. bring him in too.:::['3-23-94']
i gotta go water pete's plants.:::['3-23-95']
you know what? if he's gonna break up with me, maybe i won't water his plants.:::['3-23-96']
well, if he's gonna break up with you, maybe joey and i should water his plants......if you know what i mean.:::['3-23-97']
or, ha, ha... ...we could go over there and pee on them.:::['3-23-98']
i can't take it, you know?:::['3-23-99']
i'm always afraid one of them is gonna catch me with the other.:::['3-23-100']
it's making me crazy.:::['3-23-101']
well, honey, why don't you break up with one of them?:::['3-23-102']
whoa, whoa, whoa. what happened to playing the field?:::['3-23-103']
well, it doesn't feel like playing anymore.:::['3-23-104']
it's feels like work. it's like i'm working in the field.:::['3-23-105']
so, pheebs, pick one of them. yeah, which one do you like more?:::['3-23-106']
well, vince is great, you know? because he's, like, a "guy" guy.:::['3-23-107']
you know? he's just so burly, so very burly.:::['3-23-108']
okay, good. so there you go. go with vince.:::['3-23-109']
yeah, but jason's really sensitive.:::['3-23-110']
well, sensitive is important. pick him. yeah.:::['3-23-111']
oh, sure. go with the sissy.:::['3-23-112']
jason is not a sissy.:::['3-23-113']
oh, no, no, no. i meant chandler.:::['3-23-114']
you know, i have dinner plans.:::['3-23-115']
thank you so much for coming on such a short notice.:::['3-23-116']
ladies and gentlemen, i've been practicing medicine for 23 years......and i'm stumped.:::['3-23-117']
okay, this is the den.:::['3-23-118']
all right, check this out. lights.:::['3-23-119']
whoa. all right, less lights. bad lights.:::['3-23-120']
lights, go away.:::['3-23-121']
aw, see? you just need to find the right command.:::['3-23-122']
yes. and the dimmer switch.:::['3-23-123']
whoa. for a rich guy, that's a pretty small tv.:::['3-23-124']
no, no, no. that's the videophone.:::['3-23-125']
but hey, guys, you're not supposed to be here, so please don't touch anything.:::['3-23-126']
ikea, this is comfortable.:::['3-23-127']
this place is amazing.:::['3-23-128']
oh, god. that is the nicest kitchen. i know.:::['3-23-129']
no, no. it's the nicest kitchen.:::['3-23-130']
the refrigerator told me to have a great day.:::['3-23-131']
look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.:::['3-23-132']
joey, put that down.:::['3-23-133']
oh, my god, that's pete. okay, get out.:::['3-23-134']
how the hell do you answer a videophone? monica?:::['3-23-135']
i guess that's how.:::['3-23-136']
hey, monica, how's it going?:::['3-23-137']
oh, it's good. it's, um... it's good.:::['3-23-138']
just here, watering the plants.:::['3-23-139']
well, don't forget that ficus over there by rachel.:::['3-23-140']
ha. chandler's on the couch.:::['3-23-141']
yeah, i see him. you guys are just the worst hiders ever.:::['3-23-142']
hi, pete. how you doing?:::['3-23-143']
uh, pete, um...:::['3-23-144']
the other day when you said you needed to talk......um, just so i know,is it good news or bad news?:::['3-23-145']
oh, it's good news. no, it's definitely good news.:::['3-23-146']
hold on a second, i have another call.:::['3-23-147']
no, no, no, it's still me.:::['3-23-149']
no, it's not. i've got picture-in-picture here.:::['3-23-150']
yeah. yeah, okay. i'm gonna have to call you back later.:::['3-23-151']
monica? you. i'm gonna have to call you back.:::['3-23-152']
oh. oh, okay. um, so i'll see you soon.:::['3-23-153']
okay. i love you. i love you.:::['3-23-154']
all: we love you too.:::['3-23-155']
well, it's good news. it's good news.:::['3-23-157']
so, what do you think the good news is? joey: look at this.:::['3-23-158']
he wrote a check for $50,000 to hugo lindgren's ring design.:::['3-23-159']
oh. sorry. uh, what do you think the good news is?:::['3-23-160']
monica's gonna marry a millionaire.:::['3-23-162']
hey, you gotta get mom on the phone. call mom. call mom.:::['3-23-163']
and that's pete's mom. ha, ha.:::['3-23-165']
no, mon, you have to make it a theme wedding.:::['3-23-166']
and the theme could be::::['3-23-167']
"look how much money we've got.":::['3-23-168']
you know? i mean, you could put money in the invitations.:::['3-23-169']
you could have, like, little-money place settings.:::['3-23-170']
and, uh, you could start with a money salad.:::['3-23-171']
i mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.:::['3-23-172']
would you stop?:::['3-23-173']
we've only gone out a couple of weeks. we don't know if he'll propose.:::['3-23-174']
yes, but this is pete, okay? he's not like other people.:::['3-23-175']
on your first date, he took you to rome.:::['3-23-176']
for most guys, that's like a third or fourth date kind of thing.:::['3-23-177']
well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.:::['3-23-178']
monica's right. we're talking about getting married here.:::['3-23-179']
okay? she can't just rush into this.:::['3-23-180']
oh, what do you know? you married a lesbian.:::['3-23-181']
all right. i gotta go. i have to break up with vince.:::['3-23-182']
oh. so you're going with the teacher, huh?:::['3-23-183']
yeah. i like vince a lot, you know? but jason is so sensitive, you know?:::['3-23-184']
and in the long run, i think sensitive is better than having......just, like, a really, really,really nice body.:::['3-23-185']
jason. definitely jason.:::['3-23-186']
wish me luck. all: good luck.:::['3-23-187']
sorry. i was just imagining what it'd be like to catch the money bouquet.:::['3-23-189']
excuse me. um, is vince here?:::['3-23-190']
vince. vince: yo.:::['3-23-192']
phoebe: wow. i didn't know you guys actually used those.:::['3-23-193']
this isn't gonna be easy. um...:::['3-23-197']
i don't think we should see each other anymore.:::['3-23-198']
good deal.:::['3-23-200']
i'm sorry. no, it's okay.:::['3-23-201']
it's just that, uh, i thought we had something pretty special here.:::['3-23-202']
an you know, i felt like you were someone i could finally open up to.:::['3-23-203']
there's so much in me i haven't shared with you yet.:::['3-23-204']
oh, my god. i didn't know you were so... i'm sorry. i can't talk.:::['3-23-205']
i'm gonna go write in my journal.:::['3-23-206']
phoebe: wait. wait. wait.:::['3-23-207']
i'm telling you, if you wanna take care of that thing, go see my herbal guy.:::['3-23-208']
thank you, but i wanna remove it, pheebs. i don't wanna make it savory.:::['3-23-209']
you know, when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body......they tell their friends about it.:::['3-23-210']
hi. okay, don't be mad at me, but i couldn't resist.:::['3-23-212']
bride's magazines?:::['3-23-213']
yes, and i know that you said you'd say no if he asked you......but i'm sorry, how great would you look:::['3-23-214']
walking down the aisle......in this donna karan?:::['3-23-215']
oh, you so would.:::['3-23-216']
oh, you should get that anyway.:::['3-23-217']
well, for clubbing.:::['3-23-218']
it is so weird.:::['3-23-219']
i know what i said. but, um, this morning......i was lying in bed, i was imagining:::['3-23-220']
what it'd be like to say yes.:::['3-23-221']
i know it's a little sudden, and it's rushed......and it's totally not like me:::['3-23-222']
to do something like this.:::['3-23-223']
but that doesn't mean i can't. right?:::['3-23-224']
i mean, i'm crazy about pete.:::['3-23-225']
and i know that we want the same things.:::['3-23-226']
and when i thought about saying yes......it made me really happy.:::['3-23-227']
i need more pie.:::['3-23-230']
hey, mon, um, if you do get married, can i bring two guests?:::['3-23-231']
you didn't break up with that fireman?:::['3-23-232']
no, that was my way of telling you.:::['3-23-233']
well, it turns out he's incredibly sensitive.:::['3-23-234']
he keeps a journal and he paints.:::['3-23-235']
he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me.:::['3-23-236']
he'd prefer watercolors, but, you know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.:::['3-23-238']
so then are you gonna dump jason?:::['3-23-239']
well, yeah, because i have to break up with someone and...:::['3-23-240']
okay, so jason is sensitive. but now, so is vince.:::['3-23-241']
plus vince has the body. you know?:::['3-23-242']
it's really just about the math.:::['3-23-244']
jason. jason: yeah, come on in.:::['3-23-245']
uh, phoebe, you sounded serious on the phone.:::['3-23-246']

you must be ross.:::['3-23-249']
hi. i am guru saj.:::['3-23-250']
listen, i gotta tell you, i've never been to a guru before, so...:::['3-23-251']
well, relax. if it makes you feel any better, i've attended......some of the finest medical schools:::['3-23-252']
in central america.:::['3-23-253']
well, then, let's take a look at this skin abnormality of yours.:::['3-23-254']
come on, have a seat.:::['3-23-255']
aha.:::['3-23-256']
aha. as i suspected, it's a kundus.:::['3-23-257']
what's a "kundus"?:::['3-23-258']
i don't know. what's a kundus with you?:::['3-23-259']
please lie down.:::['3-23-260']
i've got a salve that ought to shrink that right up.:::['3-23-261']
well, i guess it's worth a try.:::['3-23-262']
oh, sure. we should see results...:::['3-23-263']
whoa! clearly not the way to go.:::['3-23-264']
we appear to have angered it.:::['3-23-266']
we? we angered it?:::['3-23-267']
oh. i think i see the problem.:::['3-23-268']
and i'm afraid we're gonna have to use a much stronger tool.:::['3-23-269']
love.:::['3-23-270']
ross, there is absolutely no way this is gonna come off......unless you start to...:::['3-23-272']
oops. what was that?:::['3-23-274']
well, it's gone.:::['3-23-275']
how's that?:::['3-23-276']
got caught in my watch.:::['3-23-277']
hey, ha, ha.:::['3-23-278']
lights.:::['3-23-279']
uh, romantic lights.:::['3-23-280']
ooh, nice. ha, ha.:::['3-23-281']
so, uh, there was this thing i wanted to talk to you about.:::['3-23-282']
oh, right. i completely forgot about that.:::['3-23-283']
i've been doing a lot of thinking.:::['3-23-285']
and i look at my life...:::['3-23-286']
and i feel like i've conquered the business world.:::['3-23-288']
and i feel like i've conquered the intellectual world.:::['3-23-289']
and now i have the most beautiful woman in the world.:::['3-23-290']
but there's one thing missing.:::['3-23-292']
it's time for me to conquer the physical world.:::['3-23-294']
monica? i wanna become......the ultimate fighting champion.:::['3-23-296']
you wanna what?:::['3-23-297']
i wanna become the ultimate fighting champion.:::['3-23-298']
it's the most intense physical competition in the world.:::['3-23-299']
it's banned in 49 states.:::['3-23-300']
okay, my trainer, hoshi, is teaching me......a combination of jeet kune do:::['3-23-302']
and brazilian street-fighting.:::['3-23-303']
i even had my own octagon training ring designed.:::['3-23-304']
and i suppose you used a ring designer for that.:::['3-23-305']
monica, i want you there in the front row when i win.:::['3-23-307']
i want you close enough to smell the blood.:::['3-23-308']
my parents will be so happy.:::['3-23-310']
creeping up my butt:::['3-23-311']
crazy underwear always in a rut:::['3-23-312']
crazy underwear:::['3-23-313']
phoebe: oh, no. what is he doing here?:::['3-23-314']
all right, just keep playing, just keep playing.:::['3-23-315']
you'll get through this. you'll be fine.:::['3-23-316']
and as always, no one talk to me after the show.:::['3-23-318']
i just was passing by and saw you were playing.:::['3-23-320']
this is kind of cool, seeing you up there.:::['3-23-321']
well, hey.:::['3-23-322']
whoa, hey, hey.:::['3-23-323']
what's going on here? who's this guy?:::['3-23-324']
i don't know. he just started kissing me. get him, vince.:::['3-23-325']
both: what?:::['3-23-326']
yeah, okay, i've been dating both of you.:::['3-23-327']
and it's been really horrible, because, you know, it's been......a lot of fun for me.:::['3-23-328']
but i like you both......and i didn't know how to choose.:::['3-23-329']
so i'm sorry. i'm terrible. i'm a terrible person. i'm terrible.:::['3-23-330']
phoebe, phoebe. relax. it's okay. i mean...:::['3-23-331']
we never said this was exclusive.:::['3-23-332']
yeah, neither did we. so give yourself a break.:::['3-23-333']
yeah, i mean, you know, we haven't been going out that long.:::['3-23-335']
come on, we haven't even slept together yet. ha, ha.:::['3-23-336']
you haven't?:::['3-23-337']
you have? okay, well, this is none of my business.:::['3-23-338']
i can't believe this. you slept with him?:::['3-23-339']
well, i made you a candlelight dinner in the park.:::['3-23-340']
you know, phoebe, i'm gonna make this real easy for you.:::['3-23-341']
well, that could've been really awkward.:::['3-23-342']
you made him a candlelight dinner in the park?:::['3-23-343']
yeah, but i can do that for you. i'm gonna do that for you.:::['3-23-344']
you know, i can't believe i went out with somebody......who'd actually have an open flame:::['3-23-345']
in the middle of a wooded area.:::['3-23-346']
okay, dick?:::['3-23-348']
hello. i am guru saj.:::['3-23-349']
he's supposed to be a duck, right? because otherwise......this is way out of my league.:::['3-23-351']
yeah, yeah. he's got a really bad cough, and our vet, he can't do anything about it.:::['3-23-352']
is there something you can do? hmm.:::['3-23-353']
do you think you could get him to eat a bat?:::['3-23-355']
okay. hey.:::['3-12-0']
does everybody hate these shoes? chandler: oh, yeah.:::['3-12-1']
but i don't think anybody's gonna focus on that as long as you wear that towel dress.:::['3-12-2']
tell him.:::['3-12-3']
it's her first day at this new job. you're not supposed to start with her.:::['3-12-4']
all right. i suppose i can wait a day.:::['3-12-5']
hey, what are you doing friday? why?:::['3-12-6']
i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert.:::['3-12-7']
you know, he's the botanist?:::['3-12-8']
oh, god. yeah, botanists are such geeks.:::['3-12-9']
is that a dinosaur tie?:::['3-12-11']
hmm? oh, yeah.:::['3-12-12']
morning. chandler: hey.:::['3-12-13']
hey. rach, i'm here with the purses.:::['3-12-14']
it must take you forever to find your keys.:::['3-12-15']
thank you, thank you, pheebs.:::['3-12-16']
oh, you're welcome. oh, please want the one with the turtles.:::['3-12-17']
no, no, no, turtles scare me. i don't need that today.:::['3-12-18']
honey, just relax. it's gonna be fine.:::['3-12-19']
hey, why don't i come down there and take you to lunch?:::['3-12-20']
aw, honey, thank you, but mark's taking me out.:::['3-12-21']
mark? is that the same mark that helped you get the job?:::['3-12-22']
yeah. it's kind of like a "good luck on your first day" sort of thing.:::['3-12-23']
is this actually a lunch box?:::['3-12-24']
um, no, it's a purse. and there's a thermos in it.:::['3-12-25']
hey, so can you make it on friday? ross: what?:::['3-12-27']
oh, yeah, i think so. why am i invited to this again?:::['3-12-28']
apparently, albert has no friends. ross: oh.:::['3-12-29']
he's excited about the bachelor party, though.:::['3-12-30']
i think the only reason he's getting married is so he can see a stripper.:::['3-12-31']
a stripper at a bachelor party. that is so cliché.:::['3-12-32']
why don't you guys get a magician?:::['3-12-33']
if a magician can open my beer with his butt cheeks, then all right.:::['3-12-34']
she's having lunch with him? lunch with him?:::['3-12-35']
you should've seen the hug he gave her when she got the job.:::['3-12-36']
and he's really good-looking.:::['3-12-37']
what am i gonna do? you don't do anything.:::['3-12-38']
keep it inside. learn how to hide your feelings.:::['3-12-39']
don't cry out loud.:::['3-12-40']
yes! unh!:::['3-12-41']
guess who has an audition for a broadway musical.:::['3-12-42']
i wanna say you, but it seems like such an easy answer.:::['3-12-43']

so i think i'm gonna sing "new york, new york"......and, uh, oh,"i left my heart in san francisco.":::['3-12-46']

ha, ha. honey, this is his office too. i told you, we're joanna's two assistants.:::['3-12-74']
why does joanna need two assistants?:::['3-12-75']
how lazy is she?:::['3-12-76']
oh. oh, my god. what did i just do? what?:::['3-12-77']

oh, yeah? yes.:::['3-12-91']
flowers of evil by baudelaire. have you read it?:::['3-12-93']
ha, ha. have i read it?:::['3-12-94']
no. are you enjoying it?:::['3-12-95']
i thought that i would, but the translation's no good.:::['3-12-96']
you're a poet and you don't know it.:::['3-12-97']
actually, i, uh... i am a poet.:::['3-12-98']
so you do know it. ha, ha.:::['3-12-100']
ahem. so, uh, what kind of things do you write about?:::['3-12-101']
things that move me.:::['3-12-102']
the shadow of a tree......a child laughing......or this lip.:::['3-12-103']
mine?:::['3-12-104']
right here?:::['3-12-105']
i could write an epic poem about this lip.:::['3-12-106']
how would that go?:::['3-12-107']
well, it didn't rhyme, ha, ha......but i liked it.:::['3-12-108']
you've got to pick a pocket or two, boys:::['3-12-109']
you've got to pick a pocket or two:::['3-12-110']
lovely. just lovely.:::['3-12-111']

listen, joey, we definitely wanna see you for the callback on saturday.:::['3-12-113']
i'll be there. ha, ha. okay.:::['3-12-115']
and listen, don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.:::['3-12-116']
uh, my agent said that it wasn't a dancing part.:::['3-12-117']
joey, all the roles gotta dance a little. ha, ha.:::['3-12-118']
but believe me, with your dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.:::['3-12-119']
three years of modern dance with twyla tharp?:::['3-12-120']
five years with the american ballet theatre?:::['3-12-121']
hey, everybody lies on their résumé, okay?:::['3-12-122']
i wasn't one of the zoom kids either.:::['3-12-123']
well, can you, like, dance at all?:::['3-12-124']
yeah, i can dance. you know::::['3-12-125']
sure, it looks stupid now. there's no music playing.:::['3-12-128']
all right, i have to get that. but no, no.:::['3-12-129']
hi. ha, ha.:::['3-12-131', '3-1-131']
yeah, listen, i'm in need of a stripper, and i was told that you do that.:::['3-12-132']
let me ask you this. what do you do for the extra hundred?:::['3-12-133']
so would i have to provide the grapes?:::['3-12-134']
hi. ooh.:::['3-12-135']
how was last night with julio, señorita? ha, ha.:::['3-12-136']
it was so amazing.:::['3-12-137']
he's so sexy and smart, which makes him even sexier.:::['3-12-138']
oh, my gosh. last night we were fooling around......and all of a sudden he stops:::['3-12-139']
to write a poem.:::['3-12-140']
get out. i couldn't stop if a meteor hit me.:::['3-12-141']
okay, we have our stripper, a miss crystal chandelier.:::['3-12-142']
well, sure. you name a kid that, what do you expect them to grow up to be?:::['3-12-143']
ahem. anyway, when he left he forgot to take the poem with him.:::['3-12-144']
now, i am totally dense about poetry, but i think this is pretty good, all right?:::['3-12-145']
check it out. read it.:::['3-12-146']
"the empty vase.":::['3-12-147']
translucent beauty...:::['3-12-148']
to yourself.:::['3-12-149']
hey, you know, that's pretty good. yeah, i think so too. phoebe?:::['3-12-150']
oh, yeah. oh, great. i'm so glad you guys like it.:::['3-12-151']

okay, see you guys. bye-bye.:::['3-12-154']
phoebe: bye.:::['3-12-155', '3-17-346']
oh, my god. oh, my god. poor monica.:::['3-12-156']
what? what? what? phoebe: what?:::['3-12-157']
he was with her when he wrote this poem. look.:::['3-12-158']
my vessel so lovely with nothing inside:::['3-12-159']
now that i've touched you you seem emptier still:::['3-12-160']
he thinks monica's empty. she's the empty vase.:::['3-12-161']
you really think that's what he meant? totally.:::['3-12-162']
oh, god. oh, and she seems so happy too.:::['3-12-163']
do you have the ralph lauren file?:::['3-12-165']
oh, yeah, sure. it's, uh right...:::['3-12-166']
on speaker]:::['3-12-167']
uh, it's from ross. it's a love bug.:::['3-12-169']
wow. somebody wants people to know you have a boyfriend.:::['3-12-170']
oh, no. no, no, no. that's not what he's doing.:::['3-12-171']
he's just really romantic. okay.:::['3-12-172']
excuse me. are you rachel green?:::['3-12-173']
congratulations on your first week:::['3-12-176']
at your brand-new job:::['3-12-177']
it won't be long before you're the boss:::['3-12-178']
and you know who will be there to support you:::['3-12-179']
your one and only boyfriend:::['3-12-180']
it's nice to have a boyfriend.:::['3-12-181']
your loyal, loving boyfriend, ross ross!:::['3-12-182']
i'm hurt. i'm actually hurt......that you'd think i'd send you those things:::['3-12-183']
out of anything other than love.:::['3-12-184']
hurt.:::['3-12-185']
hurt. all right, ross, i get it. you're hurt.:::['3-12-186']
can't a guy send a barbershop quartet to his girlfriend's office anymore?:::['3-12-187']
oh, please. ross, it was so obvious.:::['3-12-188']
it was like you were marking your territory.:::['3-12-189']
i mean, you might as well have just come in and peed all around my desk.:::['3-12-190']
look, i know what's going on here, okay?:::['3-12-192']
mark explained it all to me. he said this is what you guys do.:::['3-12-193']
yeah, well, if mark said that, then mark's an idiot.:::['3-12-194']
mark's a genius.:::['3-12-195']
why? how? how is he a genius? look, don't you see what's happening?:::['3-12-196']
instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.:::['3-12-197']
now he's gonna be the guy that she goes to to complain about you.:::['3-12-198']
well, why don't you send her a musical bug?:::['3-12-200']
oh, no, you already did that.:::['3-12-201']
all right, look, you're gonna have to go there yourself now, okay?:::['3-12-202']
make a few surprise visits. i don't know, you guys.:::['3-12-203']
fine, don't do anything. just sit here and talk to us.:::['3-12-204']
meanwhile, she is talking to him about you. and he's being mr. joe-sensitive.:::['3-12-205']
she starts thinking, "maybe this is the guy for me because he understands me.":::['3-12-206']
and before you know it, she's with him.:::['3-12-207']
and you'll be all, "oh, man.":::['3-12-208']
and he'll be all, "yes!":::['3-12-209']
and us, we'll be like, "oh, dude.":::['3-12-210']
and pretty soon you'll be like::::['3-12-211']
"hi.":::['3-12-212']
and, "well, i can't go. rachel and mark might be there.":::['3-12-213']
"man, get over it. it's been four years.":::['3-12-214']
he paints quite a picture, doesn't he?:::['3-12-215']
here's the shelli segal stuff for december.:::['3-12-216']
oh, wait, i've got something for you. what? oh... mark.:::['3-12-217']
it's okay. rachel knows.:::['3-12-218']
yeah, but even so... ha, ha.:::['3-12-219']
i can't help it. i'm just crazy about you.:::['3-12-220']
mark: okay, okay.:::['3-12-222']
i know i'm mr. inappropriate today, but it's just so tough.:::['3-12-223']
i see you walking around, and i just wanna touch and hold you.:::['3-12-224']
aw. come on, no one's around. just kiss me.:::['3-12-225']
all right, that's it. get off. get off of her. what is going on?:::['3-12-226']
what's going on? i'll tell you what's going on.:::['3-12-227']
i have been down in your store for 20 minutes, trying to get a tie.:::['3-12-229']
what do i have to do to get some service?:::['3-12-230']
hi, rach.:::['3-12-231']
uh, joey? joey tribbiani?:::['3-12-232']
listen, joey, i got a problem. i just got a call from my dance captain.:::['3-12-233']
he's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of long island.:::['3-12-234']
so does that mean the audition's off?:::['3-12-235']
listen, joey, seeing as you've got the most experience......i want you to take these dancers:::['3-12-236']
and teach them the combination.:::['3-12-237']
oh, joey, come on, it's easy.:::['3-12-239']
you know, it's hand, hand, head, head......up, pas de bourrée, pas de bourrée......big turn here, rond de jambe,sissonne, sissonne......slide, step, step......and jazz hands.:::['3-12-240']
so that's steppity-step and jazz hands.:::['3-12-241']
have fun.:::['3-12-242']
what are you wrapping? oh.:::['3-12-245']
look what i got julio.:::['3-12-246']
yeah, it's a vase. yeah.:::['3-12-247']
just like the one in the poem.:::['3-12-248']
yeah, well, not exactly like the one in the poem.:::['3-12-249']
remember how you said you were really dense about poetry?:::['3-12-251']
so i'm just an empty vase, huh? what?:::['3-12-254']
so i don't read as many important books as you do.:::['3-12-255']
i don't write poems that seem to be about one thing but are about something else.:::['3-12-256']
and you know what? i get excited about stupid stuff......like when my people magazine comes:::['3-12-257']
on saturday......and the new hold everything catalog.:::['3-12-258']
but that does not mean i'm empty.:::['3-12-259']
i care about things. i care about my friends and family.:::['3-12-260']
you have no right to make that judgment about me.:::['3-12-261']
you don't even know me. whoa, whoa, whoa.:::['3-12-262']
the poem is not about you.:::['3-12-263']
what? "the empty vase" is not about you.:::['3-12-264']
my baby preciosa.:::['3-12-265']
you make me so sad that you would think this.:::['3-12-266']
i'm sorry. it's... my friend phoebe said... julio: no, it's...:::['3-12-267']
it's about all women.:::['3-12-268']
well, heh, all american women.:::['3-12-269']

on piano]:::['3-12-273', '3-12-281']
i know, it's the best i could get out of them.:::['3-12-276']
well, people. people, people, people.:::['3-12-277']
let's try it again. and this time, let's everybody watch joey.:::['3-12-278']
show them how it's done.:::['3-12-279']
count it off, mack.:::['3-12-280']
so did you have fun at the bachelor party last night?:::['3-12-282']
oh, yeah. yeah. look what i got.:::['3-12-283']
see, she's fully dressed, right? right.:::['3-12-284']
and then you click it and, uh-oh, she's naked.:::['3-12-285']
and then you click it again and she's dressed.:::['3-12-286']
she's a business woman, walking down the street.:::['3-12-287']
she's window shopping, and, oh, oh, oh, she's naked.:::['3-12-288']
you know what? i'm gonna spend some alone time with the pen.:::['3-12-291']
i'm sorry. i was an idiot.:::['3-12-292']
a big idiot. a big idiot. heh.:::['3-12-293']
it's just, you have to realize, this whole mark thing is really hard for me.:::['3-12-294']
honey, why is it hard? we've been together for almost a year now.:::['3-12-295']
well, i was with carol for like eight years, and i lost her.:::['3-12-296']
and now, if it's possible, i think i love you even more.:::['3-12-297']
so it's hard for me to believe i'm not gonna...:::['3-12-298']
well, that someone else isn't gonna take you away.:::['3-12-299']
let it be me. let it be me.:::['3-12-300']
honey, that's very sweet.:::['3-12-301']
it just seems to me, though, that if two people love each other......and trust each other, like we do......there's no reason to be jealous.:::['3-12-302']
i gotta get going. bye, chandler.:::['3-12-303']
oh, okay, ross.:::['3-12-304']
listen, this pen's getting kind of boring, so can you pick me up some porn?:::['3-12-305']
where you going? i've gotta go pick up ben.:::['3-12-306']
we've got a playdate this afternoon.:::['3-12-307']
oh. with who?:::['3-12-308']
just this woman i met last night at the party.:::['3-12-309']
there was a woman at?:::['3-12-310']
the stripper?:::['3-12-311']
you have a playdate with a stripper?:::['3-12-313']
man, i gotta get a kid.:::['3-12-314']
uh, yeah, yeah.:::['3-12-315']
we started talking after she, you know, did her thing......and it turns out she's got a boy:::['3-12-316']
about ben's age.:::['3-12-317']
so we're gonna take the kids to a gymboree class.:::['3-12-318']
meh. rachel: oh.:::['3-12-319']
is that okay? sure. is she married?:::['3-12-320']
no. huh.:::['3-12-321']
no. you know, i just don't see why she has to play with you, that's all.:::['3-12-323']
i mean, doesn't she, you know......have any other stripper-mom friends:::['3-12-324']
of her own?:::['3-12-325']
you are totally jealous. ugh. i'm not jealous, all right?:::['3-12-326']
this is about......um, people feeling certain things......you know, about......strippers.:::['3-12-327']
and, you know... and, um... i... ugh. honey, i love you too.:::['3-12-329']
bye. wait, wait, wait.:::['3-12-330']
well, there's a kiss he won't forget for a few hours, you know?:::['3-12-332']
either that or you just turned him on and sent him off to a stripper.:::['3-12-334']
is there a julio here?:::['3-12-335']
i am julio.:::['3-12-336']
mr. pretentious:::['3-12-337']

well, your poems are unpublished and you work in a diner:::['3-12-339']
quartet: you're no god's gift to women that's all in your head:::['3-12-340']
you are just a butt-munch:::['3-12-341']
no one likes a butt-munch.:::['3-12-342']
and you're also bad in bed:::['3-12-343']
joey: all right, they got water, orange juice......and what looks like cider.:::['3-2-0']

yeah, it's fat.:::['3-2-2']

hey, mr. tux.:::['3-2-6']
why aren't you dressed? we have a half-hour.:::['3-2-7']
that was four minutes ago. we have to be out the door at 20 to 8.:::['3-2-8']

i'd feel better if you got dressed now.:::['3-2-10']
oh, look at you, all sexy.:::['3-2-13']
how come you didn't come over earlier? because i'm a stupid, stupid man.:::['3-2-17']

and that takes, what? just 6 or 7 minutes?:::['3-2-23']
yeah. once i figure out what i'm wearing.:::['3-2-24']
glass of fat?:::['3-2-25']
the one where no one's ready:::['3-2-26']
what's the matter? you nervous about your speech?:::['3-2-27']

you're in my seat. how is this your seat?:::['3-2-44']
i was sitting there.:::['3-2-45']
but then you left.:::['3-2-46']
well, it's not like i went to spain.:::['3-2-47']
i went to the bathroom. you knew i'd be back.:::['3-2-48']
what's the big deal? sit somewhere else!:::['3-2-49']
the "big deal" is, i was sitting there last! so......it's my seat.:::['3-2-50']
well, actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so...:::['3-2-51']
you guys, you know what? it doesn't matter.:::['3-2-52']
you both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.:::['3-2-53']
i just have to do one thing. it's not a big deal.:::['3-2-54']
get up!:::['3-2-55']
ooh. phoebe, you look great!:::['3-2-57']

hang on, i just got in. i don't care.:::['3-2-61']
it starts at 8. we can't be late.:::['3-2-62']
"he could not, would not, want to wait.":::['3-2-63']
our table is down in front. my boss will be there.:::['3-2-64']
everyone will see if we arrive after it starts.:::['3-2-65']
has somebody been drinking my fat?:::['3-2-66']
does this look like something a paleontologist's girlfriend would wear?:::['3-2-67']
i don't know. you might be the first one.:::['3-2-68']
rach, did you check the machine? rachel: no.:::['3-2-69']
wait. this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. never mind.:::['3-2-70']
well, joey, i wrote a little song today.:::['3-2-71']
it's called, "get up!":::['3-2-72']
all right. you can have the chair.:::['3-2-73']
really? oh, my. would you look at that?:::['3-2-74']
i'm coming over.:::['3-2-75']
what if i'm already there when you play this message?:::['3-2-76']
is that too spooky?:::['3-2-77']
ross: hi, rach, are you there? it's me. pick up.:::['3-2-78']
rachel? rach?:::['3-2-79']
richard: monica, it's richard. call me.:::['3-2-82']
is that message old or new?:::['3-2-83']
old or new? old or new?:::['3-2-84']
it's definitely old. didn't you hear the double beep?:::['3-2-85']
what if it's new? we agreed not to talk.:::['3-2-86']
it could be important. shouldn't i call him back?:::['3-2-87']
honey, you did call him back. it's old.:::['3-2-88']
yeah, see, mon, listen. listen.:::['3-2-89']
when carol and i broke up......i went through the same thing.:::['3-2-90']
you know what i did?:::['3-2-91']
i got dressed.:::['3-2-92']
really, really quickly, okay? okay?:::['3-2-93']
there we go. there we go.:::['3-2-94']
you know what? don't get up. just sit there.:::['3-2-95']
i just hope you don't mind my hand right here.:::['3-2-96']
not touching. can't get mad! not touching. can't get mad!:::['3-2-97']
not touching. can't get mad!:::['3-2-98']
phoebe: oh! oh, my god!:::['3-2-99']
you rotten boys!:::['3-2-100']
sorry, phoebe. what am i gonna do?:::['3-2-101']
don't rub it! what gets out hummus?:::['3-2-102']
what gets out hummus?:::['3-2-103']
phoebe: monica! what gets out hummus?:::['3-2-104']
if it is a new message, what is he calling to say?:::['3-2-105']
okay, thanks. yeah, i'll try that.:::['3-2-106']
maybe he called to say you're obsessive and crazy?:::['3-2-107']
so should i call him back?:::['3-2-108']
fine, we'll both sit in the chair. fine with me.:::['3-2-110']
i am so comfortable.:::['3-2-111']
in fact, i think i might be a little too comfortable.:::['3-2-113']
okay, we have 19 minutes. i want you to go and change.:::['3-2-114']
when you come back, joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair.:::['3-2-115']
fine. i'm going.:::['3-2-117']
when i get back, it's chair city. and i'm the guy......who's sitting in a chair!:::['3-2-118']
is this a little too...?:::['3-2-119']
pheebs? what happened?:::['3-2-120']
i got the hummus.:::['3-2-121']
oh, honey, we'll find you something. you wanna wear my black jacket?:::['3-2-122']
it won't go with this dress. you're right.:::['3-2-123']
well, let's just get you out of that. no, no, no. not out of that.:::['3-2-124']
not out of clothes. can phoebe borrow your green dress?:::['3-2-125']
i called him.:::['3-2-126']
yes. i got his machine and i left a message.:::['3-2-127']
but it's okay. it's okay......because it was, like,a casual, breezy message.:::['3-2-128']
it was breezy.:::['3-2-129']
oh, god, what if it wasn't breezy?:::['3-2-130']
how could it not be breezy? no, because you're in such a breezy place.:::['3-2-131']
i got it. i'll play my message, and you guys tell me if it's breezy enough.:::['3-2-132']
but how you gonna do that?:::['3-2-133']
i know the code to his answering machine.:::['3-2-134']
okay, mon, i really don't think this is the...:::['3-2-135']
okay, you're dialing. you are dialing.:::['3-2-136']
richard: hi, this is richard. please leave a message at the tone.:::['3-2-137']
recorded voice: you have two new messages.:::['3-2-138']
what a cool job.:::['3-2-139']
"you have two new messages.":::['3-2-140']
please pass the pie.:::['3-2-141']
monica: hi, it's monica. i'm just checking in.:::['3-2-142']
i got a message and didn't know if it was old or new......so i'm just checking.:::['3-2-143']
so let me know.:::['3-2-144']
or don't. whatever.:::['3-2-145']
i'm breezy!:::['3-2-146']
you can't say you're "breezy." that negates the "breezy.":::['3-2-147']
woman: hola. it's me. yesterday was really fun.:::['3-2-148']
call me about this weekend, okay?:::['3-2-149']
now, she sounded breezy.:::['3-2-150']
he's seeing someone. i can't believe he's seeing someone.:::['3-2-151']
you don't know that. well, whose voice was that?:::['3-2-152']
maybe it was his sister's. maybe it was his daughter's.:::['3-2-153']
michelle. of course! did it sound like michelle?:::['3-2-154']
oh, great. it's starting to rain. that'll make it easier to get a cab.:::['3-2-155']
it was michelle.:::['3-2-156']
it was definitely michelle.:::['3-2-157']
try monica's green dress. if it doesn't fit, wear my gray silk one.:::['3-2-158']
unless i wear it. you don't know what you're wearing?:::['3-2-159']
i'm just trying to look nice for your big night.:::['3-2-160']
yeah, which we have to leave for in 12 minutes.:::['3-2-161']
come on, i'll just pick something out for you.:::['3-2-162']
you'll notice that i'm fully dressed.:::['3-2-163']
i, in turn, have noticed that you are not.:::['3-2-164']
so in the words of a.a. milne, "get out of my chair, dill-hole.":::['3-2-165']
what are you doing? you said to give you the chair.:::['3-2-167']
you didn't say anything about cushions.:::['3-2-168']
they're the essence of the chair!:::['3-2-169']
that's right! i'm taking the essence.:::['3-2-170']
oh, he'll be back.:::['3-2-171']
oh, there's nobody in the room.:::['3-2-172']
i'm sorry, i thought it looked pretty. that was a halloween costume.:::['3-2-173']
unless you would like me to go as little bo peep.:::['3-2-174']
i didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep.:::['3-2-175']
yeah, which, by the way, chandler, i would like back one of these days.:::['3-2-176']
rach, good! listen, isn't this perfect for me?:::['3-2-177']
oh, it's perfect! but not for tonight.:::['3-2-178']
of course not for tonight. hi. i'm going to a benefit.:::['3-2-179']
not for tonight? what are you doing?:::['3-2-180']
no, i'm sorry. we didn't mean it. i love you. breathe.:::['3-2-181']
we used them as pillows when we went camping.:::['3-2-182']
the sheep.:::['3-2-184']
hey, what you do on your own time...:::['3-2-185']
where's my underwear? whoa, whoa, whoa.:::['3-2-186']
come on, you took his underwear? he took my essence!:::['3-2-187']
okay, hold on. why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?:::['3-2-188']
because i'm not wearing any underwear now.:::['3-2-189']
then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?:::['3-2-190']
it's a rented tux, okay?:::['3-2-191']
i'm not gonna go "commando" in another man's fatigues.:::['3-2-192']
then somebody's gonna have to give somebody back his cushions.:::['3-2-193']
okay. you hide my clothes. i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you.:::['3-2-194']
what, are you gonna show me my clothes?:::['3-2-195']
hey, opposite......is opposite.:::['3-2-196']
he's got nothing!:::['3-2-197']
okay, i'm ready.:::['3-2-198']
rachel didn't have anything i liked but this ribbon.:::['3-2-199']
i thought, all right, i'll be political.:::['3-2-200']
what are you supporting? christmas.:::['3-2-201']
hey, that's okay with me. two down, and i have exactly 12 minutes...:::['3-2-202']
my watch stopped. my watch. okay, see......the dinosaur tail:::['3-2-204']
isn't going around anymore.:::['3-2-205']
what time is it? it's 7:33. i have 7 minutes.:::['3-2-206']
i have seven minutes!:::['3-2-207']
which shoes should i wear? the black or the purple?:::['3-2-208']
just pick one, okay? oh, okay, okay. the black.:::['3-2-209']
do you have black with little strappies?:::['3-2-210']
yeah, but those go better with pants. maybe i should wear pants.:::['3-2-211']
yeah, pants! what an idea! or better yet, go without pants.:::['3-2-212']
i don't know what you're doing but just get in there......and pick out any shoes:::['3-2-213']
that fit your feet.:::['3-2-214']
i don't care if they match. i don't care if they make......your ankles or your knees or your:::['3-2-215']
earlobes look fat. just do it!:::['3-2-216']
go in there, pick something out so we can go.:::['3-2-217']
all right. thank you.:::['3-2-218']
i've got to call michelle to see if that was her voice.:::['3-2-219']
it was. it was her voice.:::['3-2-220']
monica, i think you've gone over to the bad place.:::['3-2-221']
michelle: hola.:::['3-2-222']
okay. that was her, right? definitely. yeah.:::['3-2-224']
so there you go. whew!:::['3-2-225']
we're out of the woods. i think i'll get dressed now.:::['3-2-226']
i'll get it. monica: okay.:::['3-2-227']
hi, monica and rachel's.:::['3-2-228']
yeah, just a second. can i ask who's calling?:::['3-2-229']
ooh! it's michelle! ooh!:::['3-2-230']
she must have that "caller i.d." thing. you should get that.:::['3-2-231']
michelle?:::['3-2-232']
yeah, that was me. i dialed your number by mistake.:::['3-2-233']
just try to be...:::['3-2-234']
yeah, we were a great couple.:::['3-2-236']
i know, i really miss him.:::['3-2-237']
well, you know how it is. it's just that...:::['3-2-238']
you know what's weird?:::['3-2-239']
donald duck never wore pants.:::['3-2-240']
but when he gets out of the shower......he always puts a towel:::['3-2-241']
around his waist.:::['3-2-242']
i mean, what is that about?:::['3-2-243']
i only beeped in so i could hear my own message.:::['3-2-244']
i mean, that's allowed.:::['3-2-245']
i would really appreciate it if you wouldn't tell your dad about...:::['3-2-247']
what do you mean, you don't feel comfortable with this? we're friends!:::['3-2-248']
that bitch always hated me.:::['3-2-249']
i'm calling her back. no, no, no! tick, tick, tick.:::['3-2-250']
okay, fine. okay.:::['3-2-251']
she's got a phone in there, right? okay, we're on it.:::['3-2-252']
um, heh, heh...:::['3-2-253']
i know it says, "black tie optional"......but this may be pushing it a little.:::['3-2-254']
i'm not gonna go.:::['3-2-255', '3-2-259']
you're not gonna go?:::['3-2-256']
no, i think i'm gonna catch up on my correspondence.:::['3-2-257']
how can you not be going?:::['3-2-258']
so i think that will accomplish the "not going.":::['3-2-260']
um, you know, just out of curiosity...:::['3-2-261']
ever since i was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends......i'm just, i don't know, not in a:::['3-2-262']
very museum benefit-y kind of mood.:::['3-2-263']
right. well, okay. okay. god, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i yelled.:::['3-2-264']
that's fine. no, but you're mad.:::['3-2-265']
i'm not mad. i'm just not going.:::['3-2-266']
you know that i have to go, right? mm-hm.:::['3-2-268']
so is it gonna be like i'm abandoning you while you're upset?:::['3-2-269']
no. no?:::['3-2-270']
you're not upset about the yelling. right. and the humiliating.:::['3-2-271']
well, of course, the humiliating.:::['3-2-272']
so we......we're okay?:::['3-2-273']
we're good. right.:::['3-2-274']
honey? i love you. yes, ross.:::['3-2-275']
phoebe: get away from that phone!:::['3-2-276']
she's just getting dressed now.:::['3-2-277']
is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that?:::['3-2-278']
you hide my clothes. i'm wearing everything you own.:::['3-2-280']
that is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!:::['3-2-282']
look at me! i'm chandler.:::['3-2-283']
could i be wearing any more clothes?:::['3-2-284']
maybe if i wasn't going commando...:::['3-2-285']
it's hot with all this stuff on.:::['3-2-286']
i better not do any, i don't know, lunges.:::['3-2-287']
okay, enough. enough with the lunging.:::['3-2-288']
i'm sick of this. i've had it up to here.:::['3-2-289']
neither of you can come to the party!:::['3-2-290']
jeez, what a baby!:::['3-2-291']
way to ruin it. i was just gonna go get dressed.:::['3-2-292']
the only person i cared about getting dressed......is the person who's:::['3-2-293']
not even gonna go.:::['3-2-294']
look, rach, i'm sorry, okay?:::['3-2-295']
look, i was a jerk, okay? i'm sorry i yelled. i want you there.:::['3-2-296']
i need you there.:::['3-2-297']
what can i do to show you how much i want you to be there?:::['3-2-298']
you could drink the fat.:::['3-2-299']
welcome to an adult conversation.:::['3-2-300']
no, no, no. now wait a minute. wait a minute.:::['3-2-301']
that actually sounds interesting. what?:::['3-2-302']
i think you should drink the fat.:::['3-2-303']
okay, if that's what it takes to show you how much you mean to me......and how much i want you there,that's what i'll do.:::['3-2-305']
let me get you another glass. that's been sitting out.:::['3-2-306']
i think this will be fine.:::['3-2-307']
okay, vanilla milkshake. just a vanilla milkshake......with chicken bits floating in it.:::['3-2-308']
no, don't! okay, okay, i'll go. i'll go.:::['3-2-310']
you will?:::['3-2-311']
you were really gonna do that?:::['3-2-312']
you were gonna drink the fat.:::['3-2-314']
let's see what else he'll do!:::['3-2-315']
how about you get changed? give him his underwear.:::['3-2-316']
i'll get a cab. i want everyone downstairs in two minutes.:::['3-2-317']
chandler: stop it.:::['3-2-319']
phoebe: ross went to get a cab so we...:::['3-2-321']
what are you doing? no, monica, no!:::['3-2-322']
richard: hi, this is richard.:::['3-2-323']
recorded voice: you have three new messages.:::['3-2-324']
recorded voice: message erased.:::['3-2-326']
to record your message, begin speaking at the tone.:::['3-2-327']
hi, richard. it's monica.:::['3-2-328']
listen, i did something kind of crazy tonight.:::['3-2-329', '3-2-338']
maybe i'm getting my period or something. i don't know.:::['3-2-330', '3-2-339']
anyway, i beeped into your machine and i heard this message......that freaked me out......and michelle will tell you the rest.:::['3-2-331']
i'm sorry, okay? and i hope that we can just forget the whole thing.:::['3-2-332']
recorded voice: your outgoing message has now been changed.:::['3-2-333']
outgoing?:::['3-2-334']
did that say outgoing?:::['3-2-335']
not outgoing!:::['3-2-336']
monica: hi, richard, it's monica.:::['3-2-337']
how did you do that? i don't know!:::['3-2-340']
recorded voice: goodbye. no!:::['3-2-341']
okay, i've got two cabs and no people! go, go, go!:::['3-2-343']
maybe we can call the phone company to change the message?:::['3-2-344']
they could change his number.:::['3-2-345']
i think after this, he'll be doing that himself.:::['3-2-346']
ross: rachel!:::['3-2-347']
you... you look...:::['3-2-349']
and i still have about five seconds to spare.:::['3-2-351']
that was about 7 seconds.:::['3-2-352']
so we're a little late.:::['3-2-353']
oh, and by the way...:::['3-2-355']
i'm going commando too.:::['3-2-357']
whitfield: dr. geller?:::['3-2-358']
sherman whitfield, london institute. what a pleasure.:::['3-2-359']
i was quite impressed with your paper on pre-cretaceous fossils.:::['3-2-360']
yes, it confirmed everything i'd written.:::['3-2-361']
you're kind of sitting in my seat.:::['3-2-365']
what do you mean, your seat?:::['3-2-366']
i mean, i was sitting there. but you got up.:::['3-2-367']
but i never left the room.:::['3-2-368']
but you left the chair area.:::['3-2-369']
all right, that's it. give me your underwear.:::['3-2-370']
see, joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed.:::['3-3-0']
hey, look at me. i'm making jam.:::['3-3-1']
i've been at it since 4:00 this morning. where'd you get fruit at 4 in the morning?:::['3-3-2']
went down at the docks.:::['3-3-3']
bet you didn't know you can get it wholesale.:::['3-3-4']
i didn't know there were docks.:::['3-3-5']
aw, is it broken? aw.:::['3-3-7']
no, but i gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks.:::['3-3-8']
did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?:::['3-3-9']
no. i had a whole story worked out, but then......chandler sold me out.:::['3-3-10']
i'm sorry, joe.:::['3-3-11']
i didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just fell out of his socket.:::['3-3-12']
what is this? fruit?:::['3-3-13']
monica's making jam.:::['3-3-14']
jam? i love jam. hey, how come we never have jam at our place?:::['3-3-15']
because the kids need new shoes.:::['3-3-16']
i'm going into business, people. i'm sick of being depressed about richard.:::['3-3-17']
i needed a plan. a plan to get over my man.:::['3-3-18']
what's the opposite of man? jam.:::['3-3-19']
joey, don't. it's way too hot.:::['3-3-20']
this will just be my batch.:::['3-3-21']
um, that's it. no. hey you. j. crew guy...:::['3-3-22']
yeah. why are you following me?:::['3-3-23']
all week long, everywhere i look, there's you.:::['3-3-24']
you wouldn't return my calls. you sent back my letters.:::['3-3-25']
what? one more chance, ursula. please.:::['3-3-26']
oh. well, this is awkward.:::['3-3-28']
why? um...:::['3-3-29']
yeah, because you want ursula, and i'm phoebe. twin sisters.:::['3-3-30']
oh. that's great. i'm stalking the wrong woman.:::['3-3-32']
i am such a dingus!:::['3-3-33']
oh, you're not a dingus.:::['3-3-34']
i just... i want you to know i didn't used to be like this.:::['3-3-35']
before i met your sister, i was, like, this normal guy......who sold beepers:::['3-3-36']
and cellular phones.:::['3-3-37']
well... i mean, look, it's not your fault, you know?:::['3-3-38']
i mean, this is just what she does to guys, okay?:::['3-3-39']
just...:::['3-3-40']
wait. you know what? i got a little story.:::['3-3-42']
when i was in junior high school......i went through this period:::['3-3-43']
where i thought i was a witch.:::['3-3-44']
and there was this guidance counselor who said something to me......that i think will help you a lot.:::['3-3-45']
he said, "okay, you're not a witch. you're just an average student.":::['3-3-46']
see what i'm saying? not really.:::['3-3-47']
um, well, get over it.:::['3-3-48']
i mean, you just... you seem like a really nice guy.:::['3-3-49']
you know, i just... don't be so hard on yourself, okay?:::['3-3-50']
wait, you're right. i know you're right. and thanks for being so nice.:::['3-3-51']
here. aah!:::['3-3-52']
do you wanna get a cup of coffee or...?:::['3-3-54']
you don't have to walk behind me anymore.:::['3-3-56']
mon? mon?:::['3-3-58']
"gone for more jars. back later. monica geller.":::['3-3-59']
wait a minute. look.:::['3-3-60']
look, look, look. what, what, what?:::['3-3-61']
it's an empty apartment. mm.:::['3-3-62']
we're all alone in an empty apartment.:::['3-3-63']
aw, honey, come on. i have to be at work in, like, 10 minutes and, oh...:::['3-3-64']
all right. well, it's not like i'm employee of the year or anything.:::['3-3-65']
ha, ha. whoo!:::['3-3-66']
there it is. rachel: oh.:::['3-3-67']
oh, that's what you're talking about. ross: ahem.:::['3-3-68']
rachel: hey. hey.:::['3-3-69']
do i look fat?:::['3-3-70']
both: no.:::['3-3-71']
okay, i accept that.:::['3-3-72']
when janice asked me and i said no......she took that to mean:::['3-3-73']
that i was calling her a cow.:::['3-3-74']
okay, walk us through it, honey. walk us through it.:::['3-3-75']
okay, well, janice said, uh::::['3-3-76']
"hi. do i look fat today?" and i looked at her...:::['3-3-77']
you looked at her?:::['3-3-79']
you never look. mm-mm.:::['3-3-80']
you just answer. it's like a reflex. "do i look fat?" "no.":::['3-3-81']
"is she prettier than i am?" "no.":::['3-3-82']
"does size matter?" no.:::['3-3-83']
and it works both ways.:::['3-3-84']
okay, so you both just know this stuff?:::['3-3-85']
you know, after about 30 or 40 fights, you kind of catch on.:::['3-3-86']
okay. for instance, ahem::::['3-3-87']
let's say janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options.:::['3-3-88']
option number one: she'll take a cab home from the airport.:::['3-3-89']
or option two: you can meet her at baggage claim. what do you do?:::['3-3-90']
that's easy. baggage claim.:::['3-3-91']
ehh! wrong. now you're single.:::['3-3-92']
it's actually secret option number three.:::['3-3-93']
you meet her at the gate. that way she knows you love her.:::['3-3-94']
rachel: hmm. okay, this is good. this is good.:::['3-3-95']
all right, listen, i have one. janice likes to cuddle......at night, which i'm all for.:::['3-3-96']
but, uh, you know, when you want to go to sleep, you want some space.:::['3-3-98']
so, uh, you know, how do i tell her that without......you know, accidentally:::['3-3-99']
calling her fat or something?:::['3-3-100']
oh. honey, i'm sorry. we can't help you there, because we're cuddly sleepers.:::['3-3-101']
okay, i'm late for work. oh.:::['3-3-102']
are you guys gonna come down? uh, yeah. i'm right behind you.:::['3-3-103']
good luck, chandler. chandler: thank you, rachel.:::['3-3-104']
ross: bye, sweetie. bye, honey.:::['3-3-105']
okay, the sleeping thing.:::['3-3-106']
very tricky business but there is something you can do.:::['3-3-107']
i thought you were cuddly sleepers. no.:::['3-3-108']
no, not cuddly. not me. just her.:::['3-3-109']
i'm like you. i need the room. ahem.:::['3-3-110']
okay, come here. ahem.:::['3-3-111']
okay. you're in bed.:::['3-3-112']
i'm gonna use the cushion. yeah.:::['3-3-114']
okay. you're in bed. she's over on your side cuddling.:::['3-3-115']
now, you wait for her to drift off......and then you hug her......and roll her over:::['3-3-116']
to her side of the bed.:::['3-3-117']
and then you......roll away.:::['3-3-118']
hug for her.:::['3-3-119']
roll for you.:::['3-3-120']
okay, the old "hug and roll." yep.:::['3-3-121']
okay. one question. shoot.:::['3-3-122']
you're pretending the pillow's a girl, right?:::['3-3-123']
remember when you were a kid......and your mom would:::['3-3-124']
drop you off at the movies......with a jar ofjam and a little spoon?:::['3-3-125']
you're so pretty.:::['3-3-126', '3-14-195']
hi. all: hey, phoebe.:::['3-3-127']
hey, oh! you know that guy who's been following me? i talked to him today.:::['3-3-128']
okay, first, i'm not crazy. and second, say it. don't spray it.:::['3-3-130']
anyway, his name is malcolm, and he wasn't following me.:::['3-3-131']
i mean, he was, but just because he thought i was ursula. ick.:::['3-3-132']
and that's why... that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me.:::['3-3-133']
because of the restraining order.:::['3-3-134']
hmm. not feeling better about malcolm.:::['3-3-135']
oh! no, no, no, he's not like a kook.:::['3-3-136']
no, he's just this, like, very passionate, incredibly romantic guy......that just got a teensy bit:::['3-3-137']
carried away, you know?:::['3-3-138']
and we just get along really well, and he's so cute.:::['3-3-139']
oh, my god. you've got a crush on your sister's stalker.:::['3-3-140']
no, i'm just gonna help him, you know, get "de-ursula-ized.":::['3-3-141']
like, you know... like i did for joey after he went out with her.:::['3-3-142']
yeah, but i didn't stalk her. i mean...:::['3-3-143']
i asked for the news, not the weather.:::['3-3-144']
hey, guys. all: hey, mon.:::['3-3-145']
joey, this is for you. it's blackberry currant.:::['3-3-146']
hey, joe, i gotta ask.:::['3-3-150']
the girl from the xerox place, buck naked......or a big tub of jam?:::['3-3-151']
joey, take your time with that. that's my last batch.:::['3-3-153']
no more jam?:::['3-3-154']
what happened to your jam plan?:::['3-3-155']
well, i figured out i'd need to charge 17 bucks a jar just to break even.:::['3-3-156']
so i've got a new plan now. babies.:::['3-3-157']
well, you're gonna need much bigger jars.:::['3-3-158']
what are you talking about? about me having a baby.:::['3-3-159']
the great thing about the jam plan was i was take control of my life.:::['3-3-161']
so i asked myself, "what is the most important thing to me?":::['3-3-162']
and that's when i came up with the baby plan.:::['3-3-163']
well, aren't you forgetting something?:::['3-3-164']
what is, uh...? what is that guy's name? dad.:::['3-3-165']
it took me 28 years to find one man that i wanted to spend my life with.:::['3-3-166']
if i have to wait another 28 years, then i'll be 56 before i can have a baby.:::['3-3-167']
and that's just stupid.:::['3-3-168']
that's what's stupid?:::['3-3-169']
i don't need an actual man. just a couple of his best swimmers.:::['3-3-170']
you know? and there are places that you can go to get that stuff.:::['3-3-171']
down at the docks again?:::['3-3-172']
in the distance]:::['3-3-173']
night-night, bing-a-ling.:::['3-3-174']
night-night......janice.:::['3-3-175']
chandler: look at all that room on her side.:::['3-3-176']
you could fit a giant penguin over there.:::['3-3-177']
that'd be weird, though.:::['3-3-178']
hug and roll time.:::['3-3-179']
i'm hugging. i'm hugging.:::['3-3-180']
you're rolling, and...:::['3-3-181']
yes! freedom!:::['3-3-182']
except for this arm.:::['3-3-183']
i'm stuck. stuck arm.:::['3-3-184']
okay, time for the old tablecloth trick. one fluid motion.:::['3-3-185']
quick like a cat. quick like a cat.:::['3-3-186']
and one, two......three.:::['3-3-187']
here's my binoculars.:::['3-3-188']
oh, great. great. you're doing great.:::['3-3-189']
you know, real strong. going strong. keep going.:::['3-3-190']
these are my night-vision goggles.:::['3-3-191']
this is the book i pretend to read when i'm watching her in the park.:::['3-3-192']
and these are madlibs. they're just for fun.:::['3-3-193']
oh, yeah. ha, ha. what's this?:::['3-3-194']
oh. this is the log i kept, recording her every movement.:::['3-3-195']
you want to hear something from it? um, not even a little bit.:::['3-3-196']
it's about you. oh, okay, then.:::['3-3-197']
"i met phoebe today. ha, ha.:::['3-3-198']
she was really nice to me even though i'm such a loser.":::['3-3-199']
"and then when i was walking home, i thought about her a lot.:::['3-3-201']
it was weird but kind of cool.":::['3-3-202']
good. ha, ha.:::['3-3-203']
i was thinking what it'd be like to kiss you.:::['3-3-205']
see, that's just something i said now so that maybe i could kiss you.:::['3-3-208']
oh, okay. ha!:::['3-3-209']
no, it's all right. i just had a jar of mustard.:::['3-3-210']
okay. sperm donor number 03815, come on down!:::['3-3-211']
okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.:::['3-3-212']
and he describes himself as a male geena davis.:::['3-3-213']
you mean there's more than one of us?:::['3-3-214']
you can't do this, mon, all right? if you do this, i'm gonna...:::['3-3-215']
you're gonna what? i'm gonna tell mom.:::['3-3-216']
honey, i'm sorry, but he's right. i love you, but you're crazy.:::['3-3-217']
crazy. what? why? why is this crazy?:::['3-3-218']
so this isn't the ideal way to do something... oh, it's not...:::['3-3-219']
lips moving. still talking.:::['3-3-220']
it may not be ideal......but i'm so ready.:::['3-3-221']
you know, i see the way ben looks at you.:::['3-3-222']
it makes me ache, you know?:::['3-3-223']
check it out. jam crackers.:::['3-3-224']
okay. all right, how's this?:::['3-3-225']
twenty-seven. italian-american guy.:::['3-3-226']
he's an actor.:::['3-3-227']
born in queens.:::['3-3-228']
wow. big family. seven sisters......and he's the only boy.:::['3-3-229']
oh, my god. under personal comments: "new york knicks rule.":::['3-3-230']
yeah, the knicks rule.:::['3-3-231']
joey, this is you.:::['3-3-232']
when did you go to a sperm bank?:::['3-3-235']
right after i did that sex study at nyu.:::['3-3-236']
hey, remember that sweater i gave you for your birthday?:::['3-3-237']
and that's how you bought it?:::['3-3-238']
no. that's what i was wearing when i donated.:::['3-3-239']
i'm kind of surprised there's any of my boys left.:::['3-3-240']
well, honey, it is pretty competitive.:::['3-3-241']
i mean, i've got an actual rocket scientist here.:::['3-3-242']
hey, maybe i should call this place......and get them to put my:::['3-3-243']
days ofour lives gig on here.:::['3-3-244']
you know? juice this puppy up a little.:::['3-3-245']
ross: hey! hello.:::['3-3-246']
ross: how's the maniac?:::['3-3-247']
oh, he's yummy. we did a little kissing. aah!:::['3-3-248']
phoebe, what are you doing?:::['3-3-249']
oh, no, no, no. you know what?:::['3-3-250']
he's not into that anymore. he quit for me. mm-hm.:::['3-3-251']
pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister......for god knows how long, okay?:::['3-3-252']
you don't just give up something like that.:::['3-3-253']
look, he gave me his night-vision goggles and everything.:::['3-3-254']
you're taking the word of a guy who has night-vision goggles?:::['3-3-255']
what? he's not still following her. you think he's still following her?:::['3-3-256']
pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order.:::['3-3-257']
what should i do?:::['3-3-258']
i think that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him.:::['3-3-259']
thank you, monica.:::['3-3-260']
or you could follow him and see where he goes.:::['3-3-261']
oh, that's what i would do. forget mine.:::['3-3-262']
rachel: oh, my god. what happened?:::['3-3-263']
oh, god. crazy chandler, he spun me......off the bed.:::['3-3-264']
wow. spinning. that sounds like fun. oh.:::['3-3-265']
i wish.:::['3-3-266', '3-14-128']
no, you know, he was just trying ross' "hug and roll" thing.:::['3-3-267']
ross' what?:::['3-3-268']
you know, like, where he hugs you and then he kind of rolls you away, and...:::['3-3-269']
phoebe? yes? yes! oh.:::['3-3-271']
oh, i was just here looking for my, um...:::['3-3-273']
my part of an old sandwich. here it is! oh!:::['3-3-274']
were you following me?:::['3-3-275']
um, perhaps.:::['3-3-276']
yes. yes. i'm sorry.:::['3-3-277']
i'm sorry. i was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister.:::['3-3-278']
so you spied on me.:::['3-3-279']
i can't believe you don't trust me.:::['3-3-280']
oh, well, what do you know? there goes my identical twin sister.:::['3-3-281']
just walking along, looking like me.:::['3-3-282']
what is this, just a freakish coincidence, or did you know that she takes this train?:::['3-3-283']
i tried to stop, but i couldn't.:::['3-3-285']
i'm so pathetic.:::['3-3-286']
no, no, it's not your fault. you know, it's partly my fault.:::['3-3-287']
it's because i made you quit cold turkey.:::['3-3-288']
it's too hard, you know?:::['3-3-289']
okay, well, i mean, i can't date you anymore, because you're, you know::::['3-3-290']
but, um... but i will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. okay?:::['3-3-292']
just stalk me for a while, huh?:::['3-3-293']
yeah, and i'll be like an ursula patch.:::['3-3-294']
uh-huh. i don't know.:::['3-3-295']
yeah, just... okay, look, i'm going.:::['3-3-296']
um, come on.:::['3-3-297']
ooh, ooh, behind the pillar. ooh, which way am i gonna go? aah!:::['3-3-298']
where you going? to the bank.:::['3-3-300']
huh. sperm or regular?:::['3-3-301']
sperm.:::['3-3-302']
so you're really doing it, huh?:::['3-3-303']
oh, yeah. i picked a guy, 37135.:::['3-3-304']
he sounds nice.:::['3-3-305']
i'd say so. he's got brown hair and green eyes.:::['3-3-306']
no kidding? hmm.:::['3-3-307']
what? i figured you'd have picked a blond guy.:::['3-3-308']
really? why?:::['3-3-309']
i don't know. i always pictured you ending up......with one of those tall, smart, blond guys,name like......hoyt.:::['3-3-310']
hoyt? it's a name. yeah.:::['3-3-311']
i saw you in this... you know, this great house with a big pool.:::['3-3-312']
yeah? is he a swimmer? ha.:::['3-3-313']
he's got the body for it. ha, ha.:::['3-3-314']
ha, ha. what? you guys have one of those signs that says::::['3-3-316']
"we don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.":::['3-3-317']
we do not have one of those signs.:::['3-3-318']

you got panties stuck to your leg.:::['3-13-15']
ahem, that's because i was just grabbing some things out of the dryer......and static cling. ha, ha.:::['3-13-16']
or maybe it's just because god knew i'd be running into you......and saw an opportunity.:::['3-13-17']
it's good to see you.:::['3-13-18']
it's good to see you too.:::['3-13-19']

...but you know as soon as we leave, he's going straight to the porn.:::['3-13-21']

oh, come on. not again.:::['3-13-38']
oh, i know. i'm sorry. listen, i'll make a deal with you, okay?:::['3-13-39']
mm. every night that you're asleep......before i get home from work...:::['3-13-40']
...i will wake you up in a way that has proved very popular in the past.:::['3-13-42']
well, now, if you need to stay late, i want to be supportive of that.:::['3-13-43']
hi. ross: hey, pheebs.:::['3-13-45']
look at you. since when do you rollerblade?:::['3-13-47']
oh. since tomorrow.:::['3-13-48']
i met this really cute guy in the park.:::['3-13-49']
and he, like, you know, jogs and blades and swims, and so we made a deal.:::['3-13-50']
he's gonna teach me how to do all sorts ofjock stuff.:::['3-13-51']
and what are you gonna do for him? i'm gonna let him.:::['3-13-52']
okay. cool.:::['3-13-53']
morning. all: hey.:::['3-13-54']
somebody got in late last night. phoebe: ahem.:::['3-13-55']
yeah, well, i ran into richard.:::['3-13-56']
when did this happen? oh, um, around 8:02.:::['3-13-57']
and we, uh, talked for a little while......and then, um, we went out:::['3-13-58']
for an innocent burger.:::['3-13-59']
oh, there's no such thing as an innocent burger.:::['3-13-60']
ross: are you gonna see him again? tomorrow night.:::['3-13-61']
well, she spent the last six months getting over him......and now she's celebrating that:::['3-13-63']
by going on a date with him.:::['3-13-64']
it's not a date, okay?:::['3-13-65']
i'm just gonna teach him how to make a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.:::['3-13-66']
well, you might want to make a little extra because, you know......you'll probably be hungry after the sex.:::['3-13-67']
we're not gonna have sex.:::['3-13-69']
okay? nothing's changed here.:::['3-13-70']
he still doesn't want children, and i still do.:::['3-13-71']
so that's why we're gonna just be friends.:::['3-13-72']
naked friends.:::['3-13-73']
hey. do you have any ice? hey.:::['3-13-74']
check the freezer.:::['3-13-75']
if there's none in there, we're probably out.:::['3-13-76']
are you just getting home from work? it's late.:::['3-13-77']
yeah, i know. i had the greatest day, though.:::['3-13-78']
i got to sit in on a meeting with the reps from calvin klein.:::['3-13-79']
i told my boss i liked this line of lingerie, she ordered a ton of it.:::['3-13-80']
how was your day?:::['3-13-81']
i discovered i'm able to count all my teeth using just my tongue.:::['3-13-82']
rachel: hmm.:::['3-13-83']
why do you have a copy of the shining in your freezer?:::['3-13-85']
oh. i was reading it last night and i got scared, so...:::['3-13-86']
but, uh, you're safe from it if it's in the freezer?:::['3-13-87']
well, safer.:::['3-13-88']
i never start reading the shining......without making sure:::['3-13-89']
we got plenty of room in the freezer.:::['3-13-90']
you know? ha, ha.:::['3-13-91']
how often do you read it?:::['3-13-92']
haven't you ever read the same book over and over again?:::['3-13-93']
well, um, i guess i read little women more than once.:::['3-13-94']
but that's a classic. what's so great about the shining?:::['3-13-95']
the question should be, rach, "what is not so great about the shining?":::['3-13-96']
okay? and the answer would be, "nothing." all right?:::['3-13-97']
this is, like, the scariest book ever.:::['3-13-98']
i bet it's way better than that classic of yours.:::['3-13-99']
uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?:::['3-13-101']
i will read the shining, and you will read little women.:::['3-13-102']
all right, you got it. all right?:::['3-13-103']
uh, now, rach, these little women... yeah.:::['3-13-105']
how little are they?:::['3-13-106']
i mean, are they, like, scary little?:::['3-13-107']
um, chandler, ross? this is robert. chandler & ross: oh, hey.:::['3-13-108']
hi. you have lipstick right here.:::['3-13-109']
oh. huh. that's okay, it's mine.:::['3-13-110']
we just kissed.:::['3-13-111']
so isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?:::['3-13-112']
well, i'm from california.:::['3-13-113']
right, right. sometimes you guys just burst into flame.:::['3-13-114']
i'm up. ahem. i'm up. i've gotten up now.:::['3-13-115']
anybody, uh, want anything?:::['3-13-116']
i'll have coffee. yeah, me too.:::['3-13-117']
ross: yeah, make that three. okay. ross, why don't you come with me?:::['3-13-118']
what is the matter with you? what's going on?:::['3-13-120']
robert's coming out.:::['3-13-121']
what do you mean? what, is he gay?:::['3-13-122']
no, he...:::['3-13-123']
he's coming out of his shorts.:::['3-13-124']
the man is showing brain.:::['3-13-126']
are you sure? hold on.:::['3-13-127']
ahem. i'm sorry, you guys. that was a coffee and a...:::['3-13-128']
robert: coffee. we could write it down. okay.:::['3-13-129']
no, no. that won't be, uh... won't be necessary.:::['3-13-130']
well? yeah, yeah, yeah.:::['3-13-131']
what do we do? what do we do?:::['3-13-132']
well, i suppose we just try to not look directly at it.:::['3-13-133']
like an eclipse.:::['3-13-134']
when people compliment me on my cooking tonight, what do i say?:::['3-13-135']
well, you say, "thank you very much." and then you buy me something pretty.:::['3-13-136']
come on, we're gonna put our hands in this bowl......and we're gonna start:::['3-13-137']
squishing the tomatoes.:::['3-13-138']
ooh, this feels very weird.:::['3-13-139']
heh. you touch people's eyeballs every day and this feels weird?:::['3-13-140']
yeah, well, sure, i touch them.:::['3-13-141']
but i spent years learning not to squish them.:::['3-13-142']
that's my hand.:::['3-13-143']
okay. gotta keep squishing.:::['3-13-145']
the tomatoes are squishing.:::['3-13-146']
oh, yeah. oh. oh.:::['3-13-147']
oh, gosh. you got some on your shirt.:::['3-13-148']
yeah. hold on a second.:::['3-13-149']
okay, just put a little club soda on it. get to it right away.:::['3-13-150']
it should, um, do......the trick.:::['3-13-151']
um, you've got some on your pants.:::['3-13-153']
i'll just throw them out.:::['3-13-154']
these little women.:::['3-13-155']
you're liking it, huh?:::['3-13-157']
oh, yeah. amy just burned jo's manuscript.:::['3-13-158']
i don't see how he could ever forgive her.:::['3-13-159']
um, jo's a girl. it's short for josephine.:::['3-13-160']
but jo's got a crush on laurie.:::['3-13-161']
you mean it's like a girl-girl thing?:::['3-13-163']
because that is the one thing missing from the shining.:::['3-13-164']
no, actually, laurie's a boy.:::['3-13-165']
no wonder rachel had to read this so many times.:::['3-13-166']
ross: hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?:::['3-13-168']
oh, okay. i learned how to shoot a lay-up, a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.:::['3-13-169']
you mean a 3-pointer?:::['3-13-170']
oh, i get more because i'm dainty.:::['3-13-171']
so, um, is there a phone here i can check my messages?:::['3-13-172']
yeah, in the back. do you want a quarter? oh, no. i always carry one in my sock.:::['3-13-173']
what are you doing? get back over on your side of the...:::['3-13-174']
hi. i'm joey. we haven't met. robert: hi.:::['3-13-176']
uh, good to meet you. robert. okay.:::['3-13-177']
what? you guys, what is going on?:::['3-13-179']
do you not like robert?:::['3-13-180']
calm down. no reason to get testy.:::['3-13-182']
you guys. come on. we're sorry.:::['3-13-183']
it just seems that robert isn't as concealed in the shorts area......as, uh, one may have hoped.:::['3-13-184']
robert: hey. hey.:::['3-13-186']
uh, robert? could you, uh, pass me those cookies?:::['3-13-187']
monica: so how'd the lasagna go over?:::['3-13-189']
really? good. so you owe me three pretty things.:::['3-13-190']
yeah. i've been thinking about you too.:::['3-13-191']
well, no. it's hard, this platonomy thing.:::['3-13-192']
what...? it's a word.:::['3-13-193']
yeah. i do think it's better this way. yeah, we're being smart.:::['3-13-194']
yes, i'm sure.:::['3-13-195']
you really sure?:::['3-13-196']
so we can be friends who sleep together.:::['3-13-198']
absolutely. this'll just be something we do.:::['3-13-199']
like racquetball.:::['3-13-200']
yeah. sounds smart and healthy to me.:::['3-13-201']
so, um, just out of, uh, curiosity......um, do you currently have:::['3-13-202']
any other racquetball buddies?:::['3-13-203']
just your dad.:::['3-13-204']
although that's actually racquetball.:::['3-13-205']
you know, i do have a blind date......with my sister's neighbor:::['3-13-206']
next tuesday.:::['3-13-207']
do you want me to cancel it?:::['3-13-208']
no. yeah.:::['3-13-210']
because if you did, that means you'd be canceling for me.:::['3-13-211']
and we're just friends. exactly.:::['3-13-212']
phoebe: hey. oh, don't sit down.:::['3-13-214']
ready to go to the batting cage? you bet.:::['3-13-215']
and first, here's a gift. ha, ha.:::['3-13-216']
hey. stretchy pants?:::['3-13-218']
well, those are the greatest things in the world.:::['3-13-219']
if i were you, i'd wear them every day, every day.:::['3-13-220']
jeez, thank you. really, that's so nice.:::['3-13-221']
but, um, to be honest, i don't think i can wear these.:::['3-13-222']
they're so tight. i'd feel like i'm on display.:::['3-13-223']
that's all right. i'll figure...:::['3-13-225']
robert: hey. how you doing?:::['3-13-226']
how's it going? good.:::['3-13-227']
good. joey: hey, rach?:::['3-13-228']
how you doing with the shining? uh, danny just went into room 217.:::['3-13-229']
ooh. the next part's the best. when that dead lady in the bathtub...:::['3-13-230']
no, no, no. come on. you're gonna ruin it.:::['3-13-231']
all right, i'll talk in code.:::['3-13-232']
remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway?:::['3-13-233']
yeah, that's very cool. joey: yeah.:::['3-13-234']
ooh. all blank and no blank makes blank a blank-blank, right?:::['3-13-235']
oh, no, no. no, the end.:::['3-13-236']
when jack almost kills them all with that blank......but then in the last second:::['3-13-237']
they get away. aw.:::['3-13-238']
joey, i can't believe you just did that.:::['3-13-239']
i can't believe she cracked your code.:::['3-13-240']
all right, okay. laurie proposes to jo and she says no......even though she's still in love with him.:::['3-13-241']
and then he ends up marrying amy.:::['3-13-242']
mine was by accident.:::['3-13-244']
the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel and kills the dad.:::['3-13-246']
beth dies.:::['3-13-247']
beth...? beth dies?:::['3-13-248']
is that true? if i keep reading, is beth gonna die?:::['3-13-250']
no, beth doesn't die. she doesn't die. does she, rachel?:::['3-13-251']
what? joey's asking if you've just ruined......the first book he's ever loved:::['3-13-252']
that didn't star jack nicholson.:::['3-13-253']
no. she doesn't die.:::['3-13-254']
then why would you say that?:::['3-13-255']
because i wanted to hurt you.:::['3-13-256']
oh, there they are. i dropped my keys.:::['3-13-257']
robert: got them.:::['3-13-258']
sorry. i'm sorry.:::['3-13-260']
monica: you would not believe my day.:::['3-13-261']
i had to work two shifts. and then to top it off......i lost one of my fake boobs:::['3-13-262']
in a grill fire.:::['3-13-263']
what are you smiling at?:::['3-13-264']
sorry, i was just thinking your day could still pick up.:::['3-13-265']
i love this friend thing.:::['3-13-267']
listen, robert's gonna be here any second......so could one of you just tell him?:::['3-13-268']
oh. phoebe: please, right now.:::['3-13-269']
no, every time i see him, it's like, "is it on the loose? is it watching me?":::['3-13-270']
we can't tell him.:::['3-13-271']
you can't go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his......stuff.:::['3-13-272']
he's right. even if it's to say something complimentary.:::['3-13-273']
hey. ross & phoebe: hey.:::['3-13-274']
so you ready for the gym?:::['3-13-275']
they've got this new rock-climbing wall. we can spot each other.:::['3-13-276']
yeah, i can spot you from here.:::['3-13-277']
okay. listen, ahem, robert...:::['3-13-279']
hey, don't we have to? yeah, we got... yeah. mm-hm.:::['3-13-280']
i think you're really, really great.:::['3-13-282']
oh, god. here we go again.:::['3-13-283']
why does this keep happening to me? is it something i'm putting out there?:::['3-13-284']
is this my fault? or am i just nuts?:::['3-13-285']
hey, buddy? this is a family place. put the mouse back in the house.:::['3-13-287']
richard: really? well, it's just like everyone else's apartment.:::['3-13-289']
it's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.:::['3-13-290']
woman: i just wanted to see where you live. now give me the tour.:::['3-13-291']
richard: uh, this is the living room. woman: that's nice.:::['3-13-293']
richard: all right.:::['3-13-294']
and this is the kitchen. woman: that's real pretty.:::['3-13-295']
wait a minute. don't i get to see the bedroom?:::['3-13-296']
richard: the bedroom. well, it's pretty much your typical......bedroom.:::['3-13-297']
we're still on this side of the door. ha, ha. mm-hm.:::['3-13-299']
yeah, but i didn't get to see it.:::['3-13-300']
oh, shoot. maybe next time. thanks for a lovely evening.:::['3-13-301']
monica: so, um, who is she?:::['3-13-302']
oh, ha, ha. that was the blind date i told you about.:::['3-13-303']
she called and switched it from tuesday. aw.:::['3-13-304']
did you like her?:::['3-13-305']
and i'm just asking as a friend because i am totally fine with this.:::['3-13-306']
well, you seem fine.:::['3-13-307']
okay, you know what? i'm not fine. i'm not.:::['3-13-308']
i mean, how could i be fine? hearing you come in with her.:::['3-13-309']
she wants to see your bedroom.:::['3-13-310']
what if we're friends......who don't see other people?:::['3-13-312']
you mean like exclusive friends?:::['3-13-313']
i mean, this has been the most amazing week.:::['3-13-315']
would it be so terrible?:::['3-13-316']
even if we were friends who lived together?:::['3-13-317']
or maybe someday, friends who stood up in front of their other friends......and vowed to be friends forever.:::['3-13-318']
you know, we're back where we were.:::['3-13-320']
honey, i would love to do all that, but nothing's changed.:::['3-13-321']
that's not true. you don't have a mustache.:::['3-13-322']
okay. okay, one thing's changed.:::['3-13-323']
but we still want different things, and we know how this is gonna end.:::['3-13-324']
i gotta walk out of here right now.:::['3-13-326']
because getting over you is the hardest thing that i have ever had to do.:::['3-13-327']
um, i don't think i could do it again.:::['3-13-328']
i know i couldn't.:::['3-13-329']
how about one last game of racquetball? hmm?:::['3-13-332']
watch the thorns. ow.:::['3-13-333']
beth is really, really sick.:::['3-13-335']
jo's there, but i don't think there's anything she can do.:::['3-13-337']
you wanna put the book in the freezer?:::['3-13-339']
okay, pick a card, any card.:::['3-11-0']
all right, now memorize it.:::['3-11-1']
show it to everybody.:::['3-11-2']
got it? monica: mm-hm.:::['3-11-3']
all right. give it back to me.:::['3-11-4']
five of hearts.:::['3-11-5']
real magic does exist. oh, wow.:::['3-11-6']
wow. joey, how do you do it?:::['3-11-7']
i can't tell you that. no.:::['3-11-8']
uh, somebody's at the door on the ceiling.:::['3-11-9']
heh. no, that's our unbelievably loud upstairs neighbor.:::['3-11-10']
he took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.:::['3-11-11']
well, why don't you go up there and ask him to just step lightly, please?:::['3-11-12']
i have, like five times, but the guy is so charming......that i go up there to yell,and i end up apologizing to him.:::['3-11-13']
oh, that is silly.:::['3-11-14']
i'll go up there. i'll tell him to keep it down.:::['3-11-15']
all right, be my guest. rachel: good luck.:::['3-11-16']
if you really wanna know how i did it, i'll show you.:::['3-11-18']
when you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was......i looked at it so fast,it was invisible to the naked eye.:::['3-11-19']
i just did it.:::['3-11-20']
just did it again.:::['3-11-21']
here, i'll slow it down so you guys can see it. ready?:::['3-11-22']

i remember the first time i saw that girl katherine after we broke up.:::['3-11-34']
she was walking with her friend donna, just laughing and talking.:::['3-11-35']
god, it killed me.:::['3-11-36']
yes, but you ended up having sex with both of them that afternoon.:::['3-11-37']
sorry, i just... any excuse to tell that story.:::['3-11-38']
hey, chandler, there's a party tomorrow. you'll feel better then.:::['3-11-39']
oh. you know what? i'm gonna be okay. you don't have to throw a party for me.:::['3-11-40']

i'm not supposed to drink coffee. it makes me gassy.:::['3-11-49']
i'll bet you're thinking, "what's an intelligent girl......who wants to be in fashion:::['3-11-51']
doing making coffee?":::['3-11-52']
ah? ah? ha, ha. oh, ha, ha. you got me. heh.:::['3-11-53']
don't think i haven't noticed your potential.:::['3-11-54']

rachel: oh, god, i hate my job. i hate it. i hate my job.:::['3-11-60']
i know, honey. i'm sorry.:::['3-11-61']
oh. i wanna quit, but then i think i should stick it out.:::['3-11-62']
then i think......why would such a person stay:::['3-11-63']
in such a demeaning job......just because it's remotely related:::['3-11-64']
to the field they're interested in?:::['3-11-65']
gee, i don't know, rach.:::['3-11-66']
order up. i got a yentl soup, james beans, and a howdy, hold the doody.:::['3-11-67']
oh. honey, come on, i'm sorry. i didn't...:::['3-11-68']
i don't mind paying my dues.:::['3-11-69']
it's just, how much am i gonna learn about fashion......by walking myra,the arthritic seamstress......to the bathroom?:::['3-11-70']
rachel: hi. is my misery amusing to you?:::['3-11-71']
i'm sorry, i was just, uh... ha, ha.:::['3-11-72']
it's not funny. this is actually my job.:::['3-11-73']
oh, believe me, i've been there.:::['3-11-74']
i had to sort mannequin heads at mannequins plus.:::['3-11-75']
oh. well, then, so i'm just gonna go back to talking to my friend here.:::['3-11-76']
you can go back to enjoying your little hamburger.:::['3-11-77']
uh, just one other thing. ahem. yes?:::['3-11-78']
i work at bloomingdale's......and i might know of a job possibility,if you're interested.:::['3-11-79']
do you want my pickle?:::['3-11-80']
gunther: hey, guys.:::['3-11-81']
hey, gunther. hi.:::['3-11-82']
you're going out on a date with the noisy guy upstairs?:::['3-11-83']
well, he's very charming. i know, he's too charming.:::['3-11-84']
but if you go out, it's gonna make it so much harder for me to hate him.:::['3-11-85']
well, you're just going to have to try.:::['3-11-86']
all right. joey? where are the jell-o shots?:::['3-11-87']
i don't know. chandler's supposed to be passing them...:::['3-11-88']
well, somebody's feeling better.:::['3-11-90']
stick out your tongue. take off your shirt.:::['3-11-91']
oh, my. joey: oh, my god.:::['3-11-92']
how many of these did you have? these are pure vodka.:::['3-11-93']
yeah, jell-o just like mom used to make.:::['3-11-94']
the most unbelievable thing happened to me today.:::['3-11-95']
i'm having lunch at monica's and this guy starts talking to me......and he works for a buyer:::['3-11-97']
at bloomingdale's......and there's an opening in his department.:::['3-11-98']
so i gave him my phone number......and he's gonna call me this weekend:::['3-11-99']
to see if he can get me an interview.:::['3-11-100']
wow. ha, ha. i know.:::['3-11-101']
what, so this guy's helping you for no apparent reason?:::['3-11-102']
and he's a total stranger?:::['3-11-104']
yeah. his name is, um, mark something.:::['3-11-105']
ah. sounds like mark something wants to have some sex.:::['3-11-106']
i'm just saying, why else would he just swoop in out of nowhere for no reason?:::['3-11-108']
to be nice?:::['3-11-109']
hey, joey, are men ever nice to strange women for no reason?:::['3-11-110']
no, only for sex. thank you.:::['3-11-111']
so did you tell mark something about me?:::['3-11-112']
i didn't have to, because i was wearing my "i heart ross" sandwich board......and ringing my bell.:::['3-11-113']
ah. uh-huh.:::['3-11-114']
sisters: joey! happy birthday!:::['3-11-115']
okay, how many of that girl are you seeing?:::['3-11-117']
how hammered are you? huh? these are joey's sisters.:::['3-11-118']
hi, joey's sisters.:::['3-11-119']
what are we drinking over here?:::['3-11-121']
oh, well, i have a vodka and cranberry juice.:::['3-11-122']
that's the exact same drink i made myself right after i shot my husband.:::['3-11-124']
okay, i don't know how to talk to you.:::['3-11-126']
i'm taking my ex-girlfriend off my speed dialer.:::['3-11-128']
sisters: aw.:::['3-11-129']
no, no, no, it's a good thing.:::['3-11-130']
why must we dial so speedily anyway? why must we rush through life?:::['3-11-131']
why can't we savor the precious moments? those are some huge breasts you have.:::['3-11-132']
yeah, heh. so, um, i heard about this mark guy that rachel met today.:::['3-11-134']
oh, yeah, isn't that great? oh, yeah.:::['3-11-135']
so, uh, yeah, pretty good. he sounds like a nice, good guy.:::['3-11-136']
oh, he is. and he is so dreamy.:::['3-11-137']
i mean, you know what? when he left, i actually used the phrase......"homina, homina, homina.":::['3-11-138']
that's excellent.:::['3-11-139']
so he's just a nice guy.:::['3-11-140']
you really think this mark doesn't want anything in exchange for helping you?:::['3-11-141']
well, i assume i'll have to take showers with him.:::['3-11-142']
but, you know, that's true of any job.:::['3-11-143']
monica: uh-oh.:::['3-11-144']
well, my apartment isn't there anymore......because i drank it.:::['3-11-146']
where'd you get to? we lost you after you opened up all the presents.:::['3-11-147']
yeah, i ended up in the storage room, and not alone.:::['3-11-148']
all: woo-hoo.:::['3-11-149']
really? aah.:::['3-11-150']
no "woo-hooing." no "woo-hooing.":::['3-11-151']
why, what happened?:::['3-11-152']
i fooled around with joey's sister.:::['3-11-153']
well, that's not the worst part. what is the worst part?:::['3-11-154']
i can't remember which sister.:::['3-11-155']
you see what men do? don't tell me men are nice.:::['3-11-156']
this is men.:::['3-11-157']
joey's gonna kill you. he's actually going to kill you dead.:::['3-11-159']
okay. you don't think i thought of that?:::['3-11-160']
how can you not know which one? rachel: i mean, that's unbelievable.:::['3-11-161']
i mean, was it gina? which one is gina?:::['3-11-162']
the dark, big hair, with the airplane earrings.:::['3-11-163']
monica: no, no, no, that's not gina, that's dina.:::['3-11-164']
see? you can't tell which is which either. blah.:::['3-11-165']
we didn't fool around with any of them. blah. blah.:::['3-11-166']
veronica. look, it's gotta be veronica. the girl in the red skirt.:::['3-11-167']
i definitely stuck my tongue down her throat.:::['3-11-168']
oh. when i've been drinking, sometimes i tend to get overly friendly.:::['3-11-170']
and i'm sorry. that's okay.:::['3-11-171']
that's all right. phoebe & ross: that's okay.:::['3-11-172']
can i talk to you for a second?:::['3-11-173']
hey, joey. hey.:::['3-11-174']
why can't we talk in here, with witnesses?:::['3-11-176']
i just got off the phone with my sister. uh, which one?:::['3-11-177']
mary angela. mary angela.:::['3-11-178']
yeah. now, which one is she again?:::['3-11-179']
ask chandler. he's the one who fooled around with her.:::['3-11-180']
she told me you said you could really fall for her.:::['3-11-181']
now, is that true, or are you just getting over janice by groping my sister?:::['3-11-182']
it's gotta be the first one.:::['3-11-183']
you and my sister, sitting in a tree.:::['3-11-186']
yep, i'm in a tree.:::['3-11-187']
did he call? did mark call?:::['3-11-188']
no, honey, i'm sorry. but the weekend's not over yet.:::['3-11-189']
oh, my god. is that phoebe?:::['3-11-190']
guess they're back from their date. ah.:::['3-11-191']
music. very nice.:::['3-11-193']
uh-huh. oh.:::['3-11-195']
rachel: so how are you?:::['3-11-197']
i am good. i finished my book. oh, yeah? what's it about?:::['3-11-198']
i don't remember. do you wanna take a walk?:::['3-11-199']
"dear mary angela::::['3-11-201']
hi, how's it going?:::['3-11-202']
this is the hardest letter i've ever had to write.":::['3-11-203']
what the hell's the matter with you? how do you think joey's gonna react......when he finds out:::['3-11-204']
you blew off his sister with a letter?:::['3-11-205']
that's the part where you tell him that i moved to france......when actually i'll be in cuba.:::['3-11-206']
all right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay?:::['3-11-207']
in person. at least you know her name.:::['3-11-208']
you just go to the house and you ask for mary angela, okay?:::['3-11-209']
when whichever one she is comes to the door......take her for a walk,you let her down easy.:::['3-11-210']
what if mary angela comes to the door and i ask for mary angela?:::['3-11-212']
where in cuba?:::['3-11-213']
joey, what...? what are you doing here?:::['3-11-214']
waiting for my grandma to finish my laundry.:::['3-11-215']

uh, i'm here to see mary angela.:::['3-11-217']
you are so the man. come on.:::['3-11-218']

you gotta be cool, because my grandma doesn't know about you two.:::['3-11-220']
you do not wanna tick her off.:::['3-11-221']
she was, like, the sixth person to spit on mussolini's hanging body.:::['3-11-222']
where's mary angela?:::['3-11-224']
she's right in there. okay.:::['3-11-225']
all: hey, chandler.:::['3-11-226']
i can't believe mark didn't call. it's sunday night and he didn't call.:::['3-11-227']
bummer.:::['3-11-228']
yeah, right. look at you. you're practically giddy.:::['3-11-229']
no, i'm genuinely sorry the mark thing didn't work out.:::['3-11-230']
look, rach, i want only good things for you.:::['3-11-231']
wait a minute. why don't you just call mark?:::['3-11-232']
who says you have to sit here and wait for him?:::['3-11-233']
you've got to make stuff happen.:::['3-11-234']
yeah, but you don't wanna seem too pushy.:::['3-11-235']
honey, it's not pushy. he gave her his home number.:::['3-11-236']
wha...? he gave you his home number, as in, like, to his home?:::['3-11-237']
yeah. and you don't mind if i call, because you only want good things for me.:::['3-11-238']
that's right, good things. that is what i said.:::['3-11-239']
ahem. hello, mark? hi, it's rachel green.:::['3-11-240']
ha, ha. oh, no. don't you apologize.:::['3-11-241']
yeah, i'll hold.:::['3-11-242']
he left my number at work.:::['3-11-243']
he was gonna get it, but he was helping his niece with her report on the pioneers.:::['3-11-244']
aw. that is so made up.:::['3-11-245']
yeah. oh, my god. tomorrow? that's... no, it's perfect.:::['3-11-246']

oh, that is amazing. yeah.:::['3-11-251']
well, if i know mark, and i think i do......i'd expect nothing less.:::['3-11-252']
i gotta figure out what i'm gonna wear.:::['3-11-253']
high collar and baggy pants say, "i'm a pro.":::['3-11-254']

what? "why don't you call him?":::['3-11-259']
well, thank you very much. now he's gonna prep her.:::['3-11-260']
you know, prep her, as in what you do before you surgically remove the boyfriend.:::['3-11-261']
oh, am i? am i? am i out of my mind? am i losing my senses?:::['3-11-263']
this dreamy guy is taking my girlfriend out for a meal.:::['3-11-264']
monica: ross, you know, this isn't even about you.:::['3-11-265']
this is about rachel and something happening for her.:::['3-11-266']
uh-huh. monica: even if you're right.:::['3-11-267']
what if he wants to sleep with her? does that mean he gets to?:::['3-11-268']
no, but... i mean, don't you trust her?:::['3-11-269']
well, yeah...:::['3-11-270']
then get over yourself. grow up.:::['3-11-271']

this tiramisu is excellent.:::['3-11-273']

excuse yourself and go to the bathroom.:::['3-11-284']
oh, no, i was just squinting. that doesn't mean anything.:::['3-11-285']
will you excuse me? i have to, um...:::['3-11-287']
finally. i thought we'd never be alone.:::['3-11-289']
can i just tell you something?:::['3-11-290']
i have not stopped thinking about you since the party.:::['3-11-291']
chandler: mm. mm.:::['3-11-292']
look, i may have jumped the gun here. whoa.:::['3-11-293']
i just got out of a relationship.:::['3-11-295']
and i'm not really in a... in a commitment kind of place.:::['3-11-296']
so? me neither.:::['3-11-297']
god, mary angela was right. you do have the softest lips.:::['3-11-298']
aah.:::['3-11-299']
you're not mary angela? no. i'm mary therese.:::['3-11-300']
this is so bad.:::['3-11-301']
if you're not mary angela, then who is?:::['3-11-302']
i am.:::['3-11-303']
oh, it's so bad.:::['3-11-304']
joey! chandler: no joey. no joey. no joey.:::['3-11-305']
joey. what's going on?:::['3-11-306']
you're it. now run and hide.:::['3-11-307']
chandler was just kissing me because he thought i was mary angela.:::['3-11-309']
what? how could you do that? how could you think she was mary angela?:::['3-11-310']
i wasn't sure which one mary angela was.:::['3-11-311']
i was really drunk, and you guys all look really similar.:::['3-11-313']
i say punch him, joey.:::['3-11-314']
yeah, punch him. yeah, kick him.:::['3-11-315']
we should all calm down......because, you know,your brother's not gonna punch me.:::['3-11-316']
well, that is usually what i would do.:::['3-11-318']
but i never thought you'd be on the receiving end.:::['3-11-319']
how could you do this?:::['3-11-320']
joey, if you wanna punch me, go ahead. i deserve it.:::['3-11-321']
but i just want you to know that i would never soberly hurt you or your family.:::['3-11-322']
you're my best friend.:::['3-11-323']
and i would never do anything like this ever again.:::['3-11-324']
i say punch him. punch him. yeah, punch him.:::['3-11-326']
come on, punch him. no. no. i'm not gonna punch chandler.:::['3-11-327']
i'll do it. joey: no, you won't.:::['3-11-328']
look, he knows he did a terrible thing, and i believe him.:::['3-11-329']
he's sorry. but you got one more apology to make.:::['3-11-330']
all right? you gotta apologize to mary angela.:::['3-11-331']
okay. absolutely. you got it. all right.:::['3-11-332']
cookie, now you can punch him. what?:::['3-11-333']
you know, this building's on my paper route, so...:::['3-11-336']
oh. hi. ross: hi.:::['3-11-337']
oh, well, the woman i interviewed with was pretty tough......but, you know,thank god mark coached me.:::['3-11-339']
once i started talking about the fall line, she got all happy.:::['3-11-340']
i'm so proud of you. me too.:::['3-11-341']
listen, i'm, uh...:::['3-11-342']
i'm sorry i've been so crazy and jealous and...:::['3-11-343']

ross: yeah? yeah.:::['3-11-346']

oh, well, you know. ha, ha.:::['3-11-356']
yeah, i do know.:::['3-11-357']
ick. you were eavesdropping?:::['3-11-358']
eavesdropping? pheebs, the ceiling tiles were falling down.:::['3-11-359']
but i really like this guy, and i think he really happens to like me.:::['3-11-361']
aw. yay.:::['3-11-362']
& man moaning upstairs]:::['3-11-363']
maybe he's just jumping on a pogo stick and he really likes it.:::['3-11-364']
maybe the pogo stick likes it too.:::['3-11-365']
all right, that's it. he cannot do this to phoebe.:::['3-11-366']
this guy's gonna get the butt-kicking of a lifetime.:::['3-11-367']
but is he a big guy?:::['3-11-368']
we'll all go. come on.:::['3-11-369']
thanks, you guys. thank you. chandler: don't worry.:::['3-11-370']
god. i hope they kick his ass.:::['3-11-371']
you know, if it's any consolation......he really did sound:::['3-11-373']
like he was having more fun with you.:::['3-11-374']
in agreeable tones]:::['3-11-377']
she totally winked at me! she did not wink at you.:::['3-1-0']
you always think somebody's winking at you.:::['3-1-1']
i say "tupelo honey" by van morrison.:::['3-1-3']
no way!:::['3-1-4']
the most romantic song ever was "the way we were.":::['3-1-5']
ah, i think the one that elton john wrote for, um, that guy on who's the boss?:::['3-1-6']
what song was that? um.:::['3-1-7']
hold me close, young tony danza:::['3-1-8']
phoebe: hi, monica. ross: hi, mon.:::['3-1-9']
rachel: hey, mon.:::['3-1-10']
has she slept at all? ross: nope.:::['3-1-12']
it's been three nights in a row.:::['3-1-13']
she finally stopped crying yesterday.:::['3-1-14']
but then she found one of richard's cigar butts on the terrace...:::['3-1-15']
oh. okay, that explains it. i got a call at 2 in the morning......and all i could hear:::['3-1-16']
was this squeaky sound.:::['3-1-17']
so i thought, "oh, it's a mouse or a possum.":::['3-1-18']
then i realized, like, okay......where would a mouse or a possum:::['3-1-19']
get the money to make the phone call?:::['3-1-20']
chandler: morning. morning. hey.:::['3-1-21']
you made pancakes?:::['3-1-22']
yeah, like there's any way i could ever do that.:::['3-1-23']
monica and rachel had syrup:::['3-1-24']
uh, uh now i can get my man to cheer up:::['3-1-25']
good morning, joey.:::['3-1-26']
here's a thought.:::['3-1-28']
why don't you stay home from work and just hang out with me?:::['3-1-29']
oh, i wish.:::['3-1-30']
you have that report to finish, and i've got to see my lawyer.:::['3-1-31']
i can't believe i date a girl who's getting divorced.:::['3-1-32']
i'm such a grownup. ha-ha-ha.:::['3-1-33']
i gotta go, i gotta go.:::['3-1-34']
not without a kiss.:::['3-1-35']
maybe i won't kiss you so you'll stay.:::['3-1-36']
kiss her. kiss her!:::['3-1-37']
i'll see you later, sweetie. bye, joey.:::['3-1-38']
bye-bye, janice.:::['3-1-39']
so when are you dumping her?:::['3-1-40']
not this time.:::['3-1-42']
heh. come on, quit yanking me.:::['3-1-43']
i'm not yanking you.:::['3-1-44']
this is janice. yeah, i know.:::['3-1-45']
she makes me happy.:::['3-1-46']
you look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking......that you're not breaking up:::['3-1-48']
with her. no blinking.:::['3-1-49']
i'm not breaking up with her!:::['3-1-50']
god, look what i found in the drain!:::['3-1-53']
it's some of richard's hair!:::['3-1-55']
what do i do with this?:::['3-1-56']
getting it away from me would be job one.:::['3-1-57']
it's weird, but i don't want to throw this away.:::['3-1-58']
this is all i have left of him.:::['3-1-59']
gross......drain hair.:::['3-1-60']
cool! oh, it looks like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal.:::['3-1-62']
god, what is wrong with me? you need to get some sleep.:::['3-1-63']
i need to get some richard.:::['3-1-64']
you broke up with him for a reason.:::['3-1-65']
i know. i know. i'm just so tired of missing him.:::['3-1-66']
tired of wondering why he hasn't called. why hasn't he?:::['3-1-67']
maybe because you told him not to?:::['3-1-68']
what are you, the memory woman?:::['3-1-69']
they're not breaking up! chandler and janice?:::['3-1-70']
they're not breaking up! he didn't blink!:::['3-1-71']
i'm not surprised. have you seen them together?:::['3-1-72']
they're really cute.:::['3-1-73']
"cute"? this is janice!:::['3-1-74']
you remember janice?:::['3-1-75']
yes, i remember. she's annoying. but you know what?:::['3-1-76']
she's his girlfriend now. i mean, what can we do?:::['3-1-77']
there you go! that's the spirit i'm looking for! "what can we do?":::['3-1-78']
all right, who's first, huh? ross?:::['3-1-80']
chandler's our friend, and janice makes him happy.:::['3-1-81']
so i say we be adult about it and accept her.:::['3-1-82']
we'll call that plan b.:::['3-1-83']
honey......i was wondering...:::['3-1-84']
...do you still have that, um, navy uniform?:::['3-1-86']
no, i had to return it to the costume place.:::['3-1-87']
i think i have an old band uniform from high school.:::['3-1-89']
you remember not having sex in high school, right?:::['3-1-90']
well, honey, what about you?:::['3-1-92']
what? i mean...:::['3-1-93']
do you have any fun, you know, fantasy-type things?:::['3-1-94']
come on. you gotta have one.:::['3-1-96']
ross, you know what? what?:::['3-1-98']
if you tell me, i might do it.:::['3-1-99']
ahem. um.:::['3-1-101']
did you ever see, um, return of the jedi?:::['3-1-102']
do you remember the scene......with, um, jabba the hutt?:::['3-1-104']
jabba had as his prisoner......princess leia.:::['3-1-105']
princess leia was wearing......this, um, gold bikini thing.:::['3-1-107']
it was pretty cool.:::['3-1-108']
yeah, princess leia and the gold bikini? oh, every guy our age loved that.:::['3-1-109']
really? mm-hm. mm.:::['3-1-110']
it's huge! that's the moment when she stopped being a princess......and she became, like, you know,a woman.:::['3-1-111']
did you ever do the leia thing?:::['3-1-112']
oh, yeah. mm-hm.:::['3-1-113']
really? that great, huh?:::['3-1-114']
no, it's just that i got this new pager, and i have it on "vibrate.":::['3-1-115']
rachel: hi, you guys!:::['3-1-118']
look who i found standing outside the szechuan dragon......staring at a parking meter.:::['3-1-119']
ahem. mon. hi. hi.:::['3-1-120']
why aren't you at work? oh, they sent me home.:::['3-1-121']
because i don't work at the szechuan dragon.:::['3-1-123']
rachel: you really need to get some sleep.:::['3-1-124']
guess what? they published my paper.:::['3-1-127']
oh! really? let me see, let me see. uh-huh.:::['3-1-128']
rach, look!:::['3-1-129']
rachel: no. ooh.:::['3-1-130']
ha, ha! oh.:::['3-1-132']
where is my strong ross skywalker to come rescue me?:::['3-1-133']
hey. wheel!:::['3-1-135']
of! fortune!:::['3-1-136']
this guy's so stupid.:::['3-1-137']
it's count rushmore!:::['3-1-138']
you should really go on this show.:::['3-1-139']
i got three tickets to the rangers tonight. what do you say?:::['3-1-140']
i say i am there!:::['3-1-141']
cool! oh.:::['3-1-142']
is ross going too?:::['3-1-143']
no. janice.:::['3-1-144']
because i just feel bad for ross, you know?:::['3-1-146']
we always go together. we're like the three hockey-teers, you know?:::['3-1-147']
i may be way out on a limb here, but do you have a problem with janice?:::['3-1-148']
yes...:::['3-1-150']
oh, god, how do i say this? uh...:::['3-1-151']
oh! ah!:::['3-1-152']
you know that girl from the restaurant with the hair?:::['3-1-153']
ooh! that girl that i hate? ugh! she drives me crazy. ew.:::['3-1-154']
look, i don't hate janice. she's just a lot to take, you know?:::['3-1-156']
well, there you go. oh.:::['3-1-157']
don't look at me like that.:::['3-1-158']
she drove you nuts before too, remember?:::['3-1-159']
i'm crazy about her now. this could be the real thing.:::['3-1-160']
capital r, capital t!:::['3-1-161']
don't worry, those are the right letters.:::['3-1-162']
look, what do you want me to say?:::['3-1-163']
i want you to say that you like her!:::['3-1-164']
i can't. it's like this chemical thing, you know?:::['3-1-165']
every time she starts laughing, i just wanna......pull my arm off so:::['3-1-166']
i have something to throw at her.:::['3-1-167']
thanks for trying.:::['3-1-168']
oh, and by the way, there is no count rushmore!:::['3-1-169']
then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain?:::['3-1-170']
ugh. how could you tell her?:::['3-1-171']
i didn't think it would be that big a deal!:::['3-1-172']
oh. she didn't think it would be a big deal!:::['3-1-173']
who are you talking to when you do that?:::['3-1-174']
look, that was supposed to be a private, personal thing between us.:::['3-1-175']
phoebe is my girlfriend, okay? we tell each other everything.:::['3-1-176']
guys do the same thing.:::['3-1-177']
i mean, what about all that locker-room stuff?:::['3-1-178']
that's different. that's like, uh, who dated a stripper?:::['3-1-179']
or who did it on the back of the staten island ferry?:::['3-1-180']
both of those joey? yeah.:::['3-1-181']
but you don't talk about your girlfriend......and the intimate stuff:::['3-1-182']
you do with her.:::['3-1-183']
not even with your best friend? no.:::['3-1-184']
that is so sad.:::['3-1-185']
you're missing out on so much.:::['3-1-186']
i mean, the bonding and the sharing......and knowing they're going through:::['3-1-187']
the same thing you are.:::['3-1-188']
oh. so, what, you tell each other everything?:::['3-1-189']
did you talk about the night of five times?:::['3-1-191']
do you tell people about the night of five times?:::['3-1-192']
uh, honey, that was with carol.:::['3-1-193']
i know, but it's still worth mentioning, i think.:::['3-1-194']
relax every muscle in your body.:::['3-1-195']
listen to the plinky-plunky music.:::['3-1-197']
okay, now close your eyes......and think of a happy place.:::['3-1-198']
tell me your happy place.:::['3-1-199']
richard's living room, drinking wine.:::['3-1-200']
no, no, no. not a richard thing. just put down the glass and get out.:::['3-1-201']
i'm sorry, but that's my happy place.:::['3-1-202']
okay, fine. use my happy place. just don't move anything in there.:::['3-1-203']
i'll try not to.:::['3-1-204']
okay. all right, so, you're in a meadow......millions of stars in the sky...:::['3-1-205']
you think breaking up was a mistake?:::['3-1-206']
there are no questions in the happy place.:::['3-1-207']
just the warm breeze and the moonlight flowing through the trees.:::['3-1-208']
i'll bet he's over me. i'll bet he's fine.:::['3-1-209']
betting and wagering of any kind are not permitted in the happy place.:::['3-1-210']
there's just, you know, the lovely waterfalls......and the trickling fountains......and the calming sounds:::['3-1-212']
of the babbling brook.:::['3-1-213']
okay, this isn't working. oh.:::['3-1-214']
i'm still awake, and now i have to pee.:::['3-1-215']
so i hear......you hate me!:::['3-1-217']
i, uh, never said hate. i was very careful about that.:::['3-1-218']
a little birdie told me you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.:::['3-1-219']
and you got "hate" from that? you're taking a big leap there, i, uh...:::['3-1-220']
we have got to do something about our little situation here.:::['3-1-222']
so this is my idea.:::['3-1-223']
you and me spending some quality time together.:::['3-1-224']
but what does that...?:::['3-1-225']
for chandler!:::['3-1-226']
okay. i'm in.:::['3-1-227']
okay! this is what we'll call it: joey and janice's day of fun!:::['3-1-228']
does it have to be a day?:::['3-1-229']
yes, because that's how long it takes to love me.:::['3-1-230']
yeah, i know. ha. i sleep in the next room.:::['3-1-231']
i went down to the post office......and it turns out it was:::['3-1-232']
those videos that i ordered......for richard about the civil war.:::['3-1-233']
he loved the civil war.:::['3-1-234']
do you want us to take you home?:::['3-1-235']
or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.:::['3-1-237']
women tell each other everything. did you know that?:::['3-1-238']
no, chandler, everything.:::['3-1-240']
like stuff you like. stuff she likes.:::['3-1-241']
technique. stamina. girth.:::['3-1-242']
girth?:::['3-1-243']
why would they do this?:::['3-1-245']
rachel says sharing's great and supposedly......we ought to be doing it.:::['3-1-246']
uh, do you want to?:::['3-1-247']
we're not gonna talk about girth? no.:::['3-1-248']
yeah. okay. yeah. yeah?:::['3-1-249']
all right, you go first.:::['3-1-250']
okay. okay, i'll go first. okay.:::['3-1-251']
so, uh, the other night......rachel and i are in bed:::['3-1-252']
talking about fantasies......and i happened to describe:::['3-1-253']
a particular......star wars thing...:::['3-1-254']
princess leia and the gold bikini. yes.:::['3-1-255']
i know! yes.:::['3-1-256']
whoa. wow.:::['3-1-257']
well, that was easy. ha, ha. ha, ha.:::['3-1-258']
okay, you go.:::['3-1-259']
okay, you know when you're in bed with a woman...:::['3-1-261']
...and, uh, ahem, you know, you're fooling around......and you get all these:::['3-1-263']
mental images in your brain?:::['3-1-264']
like elle macpherson or the girl at the xerox place?:::['3-1-265']
with the bellybutton ring? oh. oh! i know.:::['3-1-266']
and then all of a sudden, your mom pops into your head.:::['3-1-267']
and you're, like, "mom, get out of here!":::['3-1-268']
but after that, you can't think of anything else.:::['3-1-269']
and you can't stop what you're doing. so it's kind of like you're......you know, you know...:::['3-1-270']
you don't know!:::['3-1-271']
your mom?:::['3-1-272']
you're telling me about your mom? what's the matter with you?:::['3-1-273']
you said... i said "share," not "scare"!:::['3-1-274']
go sit over there!:::['3-1-275']
we're back! joey: hey.:::['3-1-276']
what are you guys doing together?:::['3-1-277']
joey and janice's day of fun!:::['3-1-278']
really? joey: yeah, yeah.:::['3-1-279']
we went to a mets game. we got chinese food.:::['3-1-280']
and, uh, you know, i love this woman. ha-ha-ha.:::['3-1-281']
you have got competition, buddy.:::['3-1-282']
well, i just came by to give you a kiss.:::['3-1-283']
both: mwah.:::['3-1-284']
i have to go pick up the baby. so i'll see you later, sweetheart.:::['3-1-285']
you too, chandler.:::['3-1-286']
you still can't stand her, can you? i'm sorry, man. i tried! i really did!:::['3-1-287']
i appreciate you giving it a shot.:::['3-1-288']
but you know, the good thing......is that we spent the whole day:::['3-1-289']
together and i survived.:::['3-1-290']
and what's even more amazing, so did she. ha, ha.:::['3-1-291']
it was bat day at shea stadium.:::['3-1-292']
i guess that's something.:::['3-1-293']
oh, man, that's huge!:::['3-1-294']
now i know i can stand to be around her. which means......i get to hang out with you.:::['3-1-295']
which is kind of the whole point anyway. ha, ha.:::['3-1-296']
oh, hey! we, uh, stopped by the coffee shop and, uh, ran into ross.:::['3-1-298']
if it makes you feel any better, i do it too.:::['3-1-300']
really? oh, yeah!:::['3-1-302']
i always picture your mom when i'm having sex.:::['3-1-303']
april 12, 1861.:::['3-1-304']
the united states garrison at fort sumter was fired upon.:::['3-1-305']
it is now under bombardment by...:::['3-1-306']
dad, what are you doing here?:::['3-1-307']
it's your mother's bridge night, so i came into the city for a moni-cuddle.:::['3-1-308']
since when did you start smoking cigars?:::['3-1-310']
i don't. i just like the smell of them.:::['3-1-311']
so, uh, what are you really doing here?:::['3-1-312']
i just wanted to make sure you're okay.:::['3-1-313']
why wouldn't i be okay?:::['3-1-314']
i saw richard.:::['3-1-315']
so how you doing?:::['3-1-317']
i'm just a little tired, but i'm okay.:::['3-1-319']
ahem. how's richard doing? you don't want to know.:::['3-1-320']
no, i really, really do.:::['3-1-321']
well, he's doing terrible!:::['3-1-322']
worse than when he broke up with barbara.:::['3-1-324']
you're not just saying that, are you? no, the man is a mess!:::['3-1-325']
was he crying? no.:::['3-1-326']
do you think he was waiting till after you left, so he could cry?:::['3-1-327']
honey, relationships are hard. like with your mom and me.:::['3-1-330']
you know, after we graduated from college, we broke up for a while.:::['3-1-331']
it seems her father, your grandfather......wanted her to travel around europe:::['3-1-332']
like he did.:::['3-1-333']
of course, he got to do it on uncle sam's nickel......because he was also strafing:::['3-1-334']
german troop trains at the time.:::['3-1-335']
however...:::['3-1-336']
i am jabba's prisoner. and you......have a really weird look:::['3-1-338']
on your face.:::['3-1-339']
what? honey, what is it?:::['3-1-340']
did i get the hair wrong?:::['3-1-341']
or what? did you just picture it differently? what?:::['3-1-342']
no, no. it's, um... it's not you. it's, um...:::['3-1-343']
what is it? come on, sweetie. you're, like, freaking me out here.:::['3-1-344']
i hate chandler. the bastard ruined my life!:::['3-1-345']
hmm. oh, i don't know. what?:::['3-10-0']
well, as old as he is in dog years......do you think snoopy:::['3-10-1']
should still be allowed to fly this thing?:::['3-10-2']
rachel? yeah?:::['3-10-3', '3-10-158']
remember when you came, you spent two weeks getting trained by another waitress?:::['3-10-4']
oh, sure. do you need me to train somebody new?:::['3-10-5']
ha-ha-ha. good one.:::['3-10-6']
actually, uh, terry wants you to take the training again.:::['3-10-7']
do you believe that?:::['3-10-9']
sarah: so that's two boxes of the holiday macaroons.:::['3-10-11']
on behalf of the brown birds of america, i salute you.:::['3-10-12']
just admit it. you have no backhand.:::['3-10-13']
excuse me, little one. i have a very solid backhand.:::['3-10-14']
shielding your face and shrieking like a girl......is not a backhand.:::['3-10-15']
i was shrieking......like a marine.:::['3-10-16']
all right, here, watch me execute the three p's of championship play.:::['3-10-17']
power, huah......precision, shew......and panache.:::['3-10-18']
you broke a little girl's leg?:::['3-10-19']
i know. i feel horrible, okay?:::['3-10-20']
it says here that a muppet got whacked on sesame street last night.:::['3-10-21']
where exactly were you around 10-ish?:::['3-10-22']
well, i'm gonna go see her. i wanna bring her something.:::['3-10-23']
what do you think she'd like? maybe a hello kitty doll?:::['3-10-24']
the ability to walk?:::['3-10-25']
i'm gonna get back to retraining. ahem.:::['3-10-26']
all right. see you guys.:::['3-10-27']
look out, kids. he's coming.:::['3-10-28']
and i gotta go sell some christmas trees.:::['3-10-29']
have fun. oh, wait. no, don't.:::['3-10-30']
i forgot. i am totally against that now.:::['3-10-31']
what? me having a job?:::['3-10-32']
no, no. i am against innocent trees being cut down in their prime......and their corpses:::['3-10-33']
grotesquely dressed......in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.:::['3-10-34']
hey, how do you sleep at night?:::['3-10-35']
well, i'm pretty tired from lugging the trees around.:::['3-10-36']
hey, phoebe, listen.:::['3-10-37']
you got this all wrong.:::['3-10-38']
those trees were born to be christmas trees.:::['3-10-39']
they're fulfilling their life purpose by making people happy.:::['3-10-40']
yes, and, uh, the trees are happy too......because for most of them,it's their only chance to see new york.:::['3-10-43']
after you've delivered the drinks, you take the tray...:::['3-10-44']
gunther, gunther, please. i have worked here for two and a half years.:::['3-10-45']
i know the empty trays go over there.:::['3-10-46']
what if you put them here?:::['3-10-47']
you know, that's actually a good idea. they'll be closer to the mugs.:::['3-10-49']
you know what? you should have the other waitresses do that too.:::['3-10-50']
they already do. huh?:::['3-10-51']
that's why they call it "the tray spot.":::['3-10-52']
i always heard them talk about that. i just thought it was a club they went to.:::['3-10-53']
i'm sorry. it's all right.:::['3-10-55']
sweetheart.:::['3-10-56']
so this must be kind of neat for you, huh?:::['3-10-57']
your dad tells me you get a couple of days off school......and you don't have to sell:::['3-10-58']
those cookies anymore.:::['3-10-59']
well, i kind of wanted to sell the cookies.:::['3-10-60']
the girl who sells the most wins a trip to space camp......and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.:::['3-10-61']
wow, you really like all this space stuff, huh?:::['3-10-62']
yeah. my dad says if i'd spend as much time helping him clean apartments......as i do daydreaming:::['3-10-63']
about outer space......he'd be able to afford a trip:::['3-10-64']
to the taj mahal.:::['3-10-65']
i think you'd have to clean a whole lot of apartments to go all the way to india.:::['3-10-66']
no, the one in atlantic city. dad loves the slots.:::['3-10-67']
he says he's gonna double the college money my grandma left me.:::['3-10-68']
well, good luck to dad.:::['3-10-70']
say, how many more boxes would you have to sell in order to win?:::['3-10-71']
the girl who won last year sold 475. yeah?:::['3-10-72']
so far, i've sold 75.:::['3-10-73']
four hundred, huh?:::['3-10-74']
well, that sounds doable. how much are the boxes?:::['3-10-75']
five dollars a box.:::['3-10-76']
and what is second prize?:::['3-10-77']
a 10-speed bike.:::['3-10-78']
but i'd rather have something my dad couldn't sell.:::['3-10-79']
well, that makes sense.:::['3-10-80']
could you do me one favor? if it's not too much trouble.:::['3-10-81']
yeah, sarah, anything. could you pull the curtains open for me?:::['3-10-82']
the astronauts from the space shuttle are gonna be on the news.:::['3-10-83']
since we don't have a tv, the lady across the alley......said she'd push hers up to her window:::['3-10-84']
so i can watch it.:::['3-10-85']
woman: yes?:::['3-10-86']
yeah, hi. i'm selling brown bird cookies.:::['3-10-87']
you're no brown bird. i can see you through my peephole.:::['3-10-88']
um, no, hi. i'm an honorary brown bird.:::['3-10-89']
what does that mean?:::['3-10-90']
uh, well, it means that i can sell cookies, but i'm not invited to sleepovers.:::['3-10-91']
i can dial 911 at the press of a button, you know.:::['3-10-92']
now, go away.:::['3-10-93']
please, please. it's for a poor little girl......who wants to go to space camp:::['3-10-94']
more than anything in the world.:::['3-10-95']
i'm pressing. no...:::['3-10-96']
a policeman is on his way.:::['3-10-97']
okay, okay. i'm going, i'm going.:::['3-10-98']
i can still see you. all right.:::['3-10-99']
hey. what are you doing here?:::['3-10-101']
well, i thought a lot about what you said......and i realized, all right,maybe i was a little judgmental.:::['3-10-102']
yeah. oh, but, oh. ugh.:::['3-10-103']
now, now, phoebe, remember, hey......they're just fulfilling their christmas...:::['3-10-104']
destiny. yes. sure.:::['3-10-105']
yikes. that one doesn't look very fulfilled.:::['3-10-107']
oh, that's one of the old ones. he's just taking it to the back.:::['3-10-108']
phoebe: you keep the old ones in the back?:::['3-10-109']
that is so ageist.:::['3-10-110']
we have to make room for the fresh ones. so, what happens to the old guys?:::['3-10-111']
well, they go into the chipper.:::['3-10-112']
why do i have a feeling that's not as happy as it sounds?:::['3-10-113']
and these come in the shapes of christmas characters.:::['3-10-116']
santa, rudolph and baby jesus.:::['3-10-117']
all right. i'll take a box of the cream-filled jesuses.:::['3-10-119']
wait a minute, one box? i'm trying to send a poor little girl to space camp.:::['3-10-120']
i'm putting you down for five boxes. chandler, what about you?:::['3-10-121']
all right, do you have any, uh, coconut-flavored deities?:::['3-10-122']
no, but there's coconut in the hanukkah menorah-eos.:::['3-10-123']
i'll put you down for eight boxes, one for each night.:::['3-10-124']
ross: mon? i'll take one box of the mint treasures.:::['3-10-126']
one, and that's it.:::['3-10-127']
i started gaining weight after i joined the brown birds.:::['3-10-128']
remember dad bought every one of my boxes and i ate them all?:::['3-10-129']
no, mon, dad had to buy every one of your boxes......because you ate them all.:::['3-10-130']
but, you know, i'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.:::['3-10-131']
why don't i just put you down for three mint treasures......and just a couple of the rudolphs?:::['3-10-132']
oh, come on, now. you know you want them.:::['3-10-134']
don't do this.:::['3-10-135']
i'll tell you what, mon. i'll give you the first box for free.:::['3-10-136']
oh, god, i gotta go.:::['3-10-137']
come on. all the cool kids are eating them.:::['3-10-138']
and later i wanna show you why we don't just trap spiders......under coffee mugs:::['3-10-139']
and leave them there.:::['3-10-140']
i'm training to be better at a job that i hate. my life officially sucks.:::['3-10-141']
but wasn't this supposed to be temporary? i thought you wanted to do fashion stuff.:::['3-10-142']
well, yeah, i'm still pursuing that.:::['3-10-143']
how, exactly, are you pursuing that?:::['3-10-144']
you know, other than sending out résumés, like, what, two years ago?:::['3-10-145']
well, i'm also sending out......good thoughts.:::['3-10-146']
if you ask me, as long as you got this job......you got nothing pushing you:::['3-10-147']
to get another one.:::['3-10-148']
you need the fear.:::['3-10-149']
the fear? chandler: he's right.:::['3-10-150']
if you quit this job, you then have motivation......to go after a job you really want.:::['3-10-151']
how come you're still at a job you hate? why don't you quit and get the fear?:::['3-10-152']
because i'm too afraid.:::['3-10-153']
god. i don't know.:::['3-10-154']
i mean, i would give anything to work for a designer, you know, or a buyer.:::['3-10-155']
ugh. i just don't wanna be 30 and still work here.:::['3-10-156']
yeah, that'd be much worse than being 28 and still working here.:::['3-10-157']
remind me to review with you which pot is decaf and which is regular.:::['3-10-159']
can't i just look at the handles on them?:::['3-10-160']
okay, fine. gunther, you know what? i am a terrible waitress.:::['3-10-162']
do you know why i'm a terrible waitress? because i don't care.:::['3-10-163']
i don't care. i don't care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf.:::['3-10-164']
i don't care where the tray spot is.:::['3-10-165']
i just don't care. this is not what i wanna do.:::['3-10-166']
so i don't think i should do it anymore.:::['3-10-167']
i'm gonna give you my week's notice. what?:::['3-10-168']
gunther, i quit.:::['3-10-169']
does this mean we're gonna have to start paying for coffee?:::['3-10-170']
okay, 12.:::['3-10-171']
twenty-two.:::['3-10-172']
eighteen.:::['3-10-173']
what? i spelled out "boobies." ha, ha.:::['3-10-174']
ross, put me down for another box of the mint treasures, okay?:::['3-10-175']
where are the mint treasures?:::['3-10-176']
uh, we're out. i sold them all.:::['3-10-177']
monica, i'm cutting you off.:::['3-10-179']
just a couple more boxes.:::['3-10-181']
it's no big deal, all right? i'm cool.:::['3-10-182']
you gotta help me out with a couple more boxes.:::['3-10-183']
mon, look at yourself. you have cookie on your neck.:::['3-10-184']
whoa. so how many you sold so far? ah? check this out.:::['3-10-186']
five hundred and seventeen boxes. oh, my god. how did you do that?:::['3-10-187']
ahem. okay, the other night, i was leaving the museum......just as laser floyd was letting out:::['3-10-188']
of the planetarium.:::['3-10-189']
without even trying, i sold 50 boxes.:::['3-10-190']
that's when it occurred to me. the key to my success: the munchies.:::['3-10-191']
so i started hitting the nyu dorms around midnight.:::['3-10-192']
i am selling cookies by the case.:::['3-10-193']
they call me......"cookie dude.":::['3-10-194']
okay, stop what you're doing. i need envelope stuffers, stamp lickers...:::['3-10-195']
oh, hey. who did these résumés for you?:::['3-10-196']
me, on my computer.:::['3-10-197']
well, you sure used a large font.:::['3-10-198']
uh, yeah. well, "waitress at a coffeehouse"......and "cheer squad co-captain":::['3-10-199']
only took up so much room.:::['3-10-200']
heh, heh. hey, that's funny.:::['3-10-201']
you're funny, chandler. you're a funny guy.:::['3-10-202']
you know what else is really funny?:::['3-10-203']
something else i might have said?:::['3-10-204']
i don't know, i don't know.:::['3-10-205']
weren't you the guy that told me to quit my job......when i had absolutely:::['3-10-206']
nothing else to do?:::['3-10-207']
ha-ha-ha. huh? huh?:::['3-10-208']
sweetie, calm down. it's gonna be okay.:::['3-10-209']
rachel: no, it's not gonna be okay, ross.:::['3-10-210']
tomorrow is my last day, and i don't have a lead.:::['3-10-211']
okay, you know what? i'm just gonna call gunther......and i'm gonna tell him i'm not quitting.:::['3-10-212']
you don't wanna give in to the fear.:::['3-10-213']
you and your stupid fear. i hate your fear.:::['3-10-214']
i would like to take you and your fear...:::['3-10-215']
hey. i got great news.:::['3-10-216']
run, joey. run for your life.:::['3-10-217']
what? rach, listen, have you ever heard of fortunata fashions?:::['3-10-218']
no. my old man's doing a plumbing job there......and he heard they have an opening.:::['3-10-219']
want me to see if he can get you an interview?:::['3-10-220']
oh, my god, yes. i would love that. oh, that's so sweet, joey.:::['3-10-221']
not a problem. and now for the great news.:::['3-10-222']
what, that wasn't the great news? only if you think it's better than this.:::['3-10-223']
snow-in-a-can.:::['3-10-224']
i got it at work. you want me to decorate the window?:::['3-10-225']
give it kind of a christmas looky? christmas cookie?:::['3-10-226']
okay, and this one here's a douglas fir.:::['3-10-227']
now, it's a little more money, but you get a nicer smell.:::['3-10-228']
looks good. i'll take it.:::['3-10-229']
wait, wait, wait. no, no, no. you don't want that one. uh-uh.:::['3-10-230']
no. you can have this cool brown one. ooh.:::['3-10-231']
it's almost dead.:::['3-10-232']
but that's why you have to buy it, so that it can fulfill its christmas destiny.:::['3-10-233']
otherwise, they're gonna throw it into the chipper. tell him, joey.:::['3-10-234']
yeah, the trees that don't fulfill their christmas destiny, heh......are thrown in the chipper.:::['3-10-236']
i think i'm gonna look around a little bit more.:::['3-10-237']
pheebs. heh. you gotta stop doing this. i'm working on commission here.:::['3-10-238']
monica: hey, guys. i'm here to pick out my christmas tree.:::['3-10-239']
well, look no further. this one's yours.:::['3-10-240']
is this the one that i threw out last year?:::['3-10-242']
all right, you know what? never mind. everybody wants to have a green one.:::['3-10-243']
i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i didn't mean to get so emotional.:::['3-10-244']
i guess it's just... the holidays are just hard.:::['3-10-245']
oh, honey, is that because your mom died around christmas?:::['3-10-246']
oh, i wasn't even thinking about that.:::['3-10-247']
hi there. how many did you sell?:::['3-10-249']
i'm not gonna tell you. you're the bad man who broke sarah's leg.:::['3-10-250']
hey, now. that was an accident, okay?:::['3-10-251']
you're a big scrud.:::['3-10-252']
what's a scrud?:::['3-10-253']
why don't you look in the mirror, scrud?:::['3-10-254']
i don't have to. i can just look at you.:::['3-10-255']
all right, girls......and man.:::['3-10-256']

hi there. hi.:::['3-10-272']
and batting for sarah......ross geller.:::['3-10-273']
eight hundred and seventy-two.:::['3-10-274']
although it looks like you bought an awful lot of cookies yourself.:::['3-10-275']
ahem. that is because my doctor says that i have a very serious......nougat......deficiency.:::['3-10-276']
tell us what happened, brown bird ross.:::['3-10-277']
well, i lost.:::['3-10-278']
some little girl loaned her uniform to her 19-year-old sister......who went down to the uss nimitz:::['3-10-279']
and sold over 2000 boxes.:::['3-10-280']
chandler: hey. how'd the interview go? oh, i blew it.:::['3-10-281']
i wouldn't have even hired me. ross: oh.:::['3-10-282']
ugh. come here, sweetie.:::['3-10-283']
listen, you're gonna go on like a thousand interviews before you get a job.:::['3-10-284']
that's not how that was supposed to come out.:::['3-10-285']
this is just the worst christmas ever.:::['3-10-286']
rach, maybe you should just, you know, stay here at the coffeehouse.:::['3-10-287']
i can't. it's too late. terry already hired that girl over there.:::['3-10-288']
look at her. she's even got waitress experience. ugh.:::['3-10-289']
last night she was......teaching everybody:::['3-10-290']
how to make napkins into......swans.:::['3-10-291']
that word was "swans.":::['3-10-292']
"swans.":::['3-10-293']
well, seeing that drunk santa wet himself really perked up my christmas.:::['3-10-294']
phoebe: you saved them. you guys.:::['3-10-297']
oh, god, you're the best.:::['3-10-298']
looks like night of the living dead christmas trees.:::['3-10-299']
yeah, this is she.:::['3-10-301']
oh! you're kidding. you're kidding.:::['3-10-302']
oh, thank you. i love you.:::['3-10-303']

"pomp and circumstance march no. 1"]:::['3-10-309']
there you go. enjoy.:::['3-10-310']
should i tell her i ordered tea? no.:::['3-10-312']
um, excuse me, everyone?:::['3-10-314']
uh, this is my last night working here......and i just wanted to say:::['3-10-315']
that i made some really good friends here.:::['3-10-316']
and it's just time to move on.:::['3-10-317']
and no offense to everybody who still works here......but you have no idea:::['3-10-318']
how good it feels to say......that as of this moment......i will never have to make coffee again.:::['3-10-319']
now, mr. kaplan sr. likes his coffee strong.:::['3-10-320']
so you're gonna use two bags instead of one, see?:::['3-10-321']
now, pay attention because this part's tricky.:::['3-10-322']
see, some people use filters just once.:::['3-10-323']
i'm sorry you didn't get to go to space camp......and i'm hoping that maybe somehow,this may help make up for it. okay?:::['3-10-324']
presenting......sarah tuddle's private,very special space camp!:::['3-10-325']
really, mr. geller, you don't have to do this.:::['3-10-326']

i'm an alien. i'm an alien.:::['3-10-333']
ross: oh, no, an asteroid!:::['3-10-334']
'cause every time i see your face:::['3-14-0']
i can't help but fall from grace:::['3-14-1']
wow. this girl's good.:::['3-14-2']
oh, yeah, a song with rhyming words. ooh, i never thought of that before.:::['3-14-3']
i like her.:::['3-14-4']
why? because she can sing and play guitar......and do both at the same time?:::['3-14-5']
well, that's pretty much all i'm looking for from these people.:::['3-14-6']
look at you, all jealous.:::['3-14-7']
yeah, pheebs, come on. you two have completely different styles.:::['3-14-8']
you know, she's more... you know? and you're more::::['3-14-9']
say you'll stay beside me:::['3-14-10']
okay. see? see? everybody else is happy she's done.:::['3-14-11']
okay, my next song's called::::['3-14-12']
"phoebe buffay, what can i say? i really loved when we were......singing partners and i shouldn't:::['3-14-13']
have left you that way.":::['3-14-14']
oh, no. one of those look-for-the-hidden-meaning songs.:::['3-14-15']
hey, phoebe.:::['3-14-16']
hey, leslie.:::['3-14-17']
how'd you know i'd be here?:::['3-14-18']
i ran into vlad at the place where they sell the big fish......and he said you played here a lot, so...:::['3-14-19']
all right. i have to go to the bathroom.:::['3-14-20']
but if the place with the big fish comes up again......i'd like to know whether that's several:::['3-14-21']
big fish or just one big fish.:::['3-14-22']
so phoebe tells us you write jingles.:::['3-14-23']
actually, i said she abandoned me to write jingles.:::['3-14-24']
uh, anything we might've heard of?:::['3-14-25']
uh, yeah, um...:::['3-14-26']
home is never far away:::['3-14-27']
all: home is homestar stew:::['3-14-28']
yeah, but i don't do that anymore. i got kind of sick of it.:::['3-14-29']
and then i couldn't come up with anything good, so they fired me.:::['3-14-30']
hmm, bummer.:::['3-14-31']
well, you know, i was just...:::['3-14-32']
um, i was just thinking and just hoping that......maybe you'd want:::['3-14-33']
to get back together?:::['3-14-34']
no, but thanks.:::['3-14-35', '3-14-38']
oh, come on, phoebe. would you just think about it?:::['3-14-36']
see you, pheebs.:::['3-14-40']
wow. that was kind of brutal.:::['3-14-41']
well, okay. let this be a lesson to all of you.:::['3-14-42']
all right? once you betray me, i become like the ice woman.:::['3-14-43']
you know, i'm just very cold, hard, unyielding.:::['3-14-44']
you know, nothing, nothing can penetrate this icy exterior.:::['3-14-45']
can i have a tissue, please?:::['3-14-46']
is someone in there?:::['3-14-48']
no. this is just part of a daredevil game......that i play called "wait until:::['3-14-49']
the last moment before i burst and die.":::['3-14-50']
jeez, man. did you fall...? hi.:::['3-14-51']
so, uh, did you? did you fall high?:::['3-14-52']
someone was in the ladies' room. i couldn't wait.:::['3-14-53']

yes, i do have to go to the bathroom.:::['3-14-62']
gunther: someone in here.:::['3-14-63']
where's chandler? he can't make it.:::['3-14-64']
he said he had to go back to his, uh, job to do, uh...:::['3-14-65']
joey tribbiani?:::['3-14-68']
joey, i can see you, okay?:::['3-14-69']

well, we're gonna miss you around here.:::['3-14-87']
so see you on saturday. yeah, you bet.:::['3-14-89']

yeah, that was leslie calling again to see if we can get back together.:::['3-14-93']
it's like the 20th time today. yeah, good luck, leslie.:::['3-14-94']
wow. she must've hurt you pretty bad, huh?:::['3-14-95']
well, yeah. you know, we were best friends......ever since we were little.:::['3-14-96']
our moms worked on the barge together.:::['3-14-97']
you two must've been so cute running around on a barge.:::['3-14-98']
you never run on a barge.:::['3-14-99']
is, uh...? is chandler around?:::['3-14-101']
no, um, he met some girl at the coffeehouse.:::['3-14-102']
joey: ooh. yeah. ginger something.:::['3-14-103']
no, no. uh, are you sure it wasn't something that sounded liked ginger?:::['3-14-105']
like, uh, "gingeer"?:::['3-14-106']
no, it was ginger.:::['3-14-107']
i remember because when he told me, i said::::['3-14-108']
the movie star:::['3-14-109']
that's the girl i was hiding from.:::['3-14-111']
when she finds out he's my roommate, she'll tell him what i did.:::['3-14-112']
what did you do? oh. oh, no, no. i can't...:::['3-14-113']
i can't tell you that. it's like the most awful, horrible thing......i've ever done in my whole life.:::['3-14-114']
you know what? don't tell us.:::['3-14-115']
we'll wait till chandler gets home because it'll be more fun.:::['3-14-116']
okay, it was, like, four years ago.:::['3-14-118']
okay, ginger and i had gone out a few times. then one weekend......we went to her dad's cabin......just me, her and her:::['3-14-119']
annoying little dog, pepper. heh.:::['3-14-120']
well, that night i cooked this really romantic dinner...:::['3-14-121']
you gave her food poisoning.:::['3-14-122']
i wish. no.:::['3-14-123']
after dinner, me, her and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire.:::['3-14-124']
well, i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out......so i picked up a log and threw it on.:::['3-14-125']
or at least what i thought was a log.:::['3-14-126']
oh, my god. you threw pepper on the fire.:::['3-14-127']
see, i guess another thing i probably should've told you about ginger......is that she kind of has a, uh......artificial leg.:::['3-14-129']
joey. what did you do after you threw her leg on the fire?:::['3-14-131']
i ran.:::['3-14-132']
well, that's the best kiss i've had......with anybody i met in a men's room.:::['3-14-133']
actually, me too.:::['3-14-134']
oh. foot in a puddle. foot all in the puddle.:::['3-14-135']
oh, damn. i hate that.:::['3-14-136']
we're gonna have to get you out of those shoes.:::['3-14-137']
oh, don't worry about it.:::['3-14-138']
no, really. you're gonna freeze. no, i'm not.:::['3-14-139']
huh. you're not? what do you got, a bionic foot?:::['3-14-140']
someday. maybe.:::['3-14-141']
funny book?:::['3-14-142']
hmm? oh, no, no. i'm just thinking about something funny i heard today.:::['3-14-143']
um, mark saying, "i'll see you saturday.":::['3-14-144']
yeah, at the lecture.:::['3-14-145']
i told you that last week. you said you didn't mind.:::['3-14-146']
oh, no, no, no. it's not the lecture, uh, i mind. um...:::['3-14-147']
oh, please tell me it's not because i'm going with mark.:::['3-14-148']
well... oh, my god. ross.:::['3-14-149']
well, i'm sorry, but... look, if you're not working with him anymore......why do you still have to do stuff:::['3-14-150']
with him?:::['3-14-151']
because he's my friend.:::['3-14-152']
okay. but do you really need another friend? i mean...:::['3-14-153']
okay. well, if i stop playing with joey and chandler, can i play with mark?:::['3-14-154']
is that funny? am i suppose to be laughing?:::['3-14-155']
i don't know. you thought "see you saturday" was funny.:::['3-14-156']
look, honey, mark is in fashion, okay?:::['3-14-157']
i like having a friend that i can share this stuff with.:::['3-14-158']
you guys would never go to a lecture with me.:::['3-14-159']
i would love to go with you.:::['3-14-160']
hey, i have clothes. i even pick them out.:::['3-14-162']
i mean, for all you know, i could be a fashion......monger.:::['3-14-163']
okay. honey, i would love for you to go with me.:::['3-14-164']
what should i wear? now i'm all nervous.:::['3-14-166']
you know, they say, "a watched pot never beeps.":::['3-14-167']
it's, you know, ahem... it's been a couple hours......and she hasn't called.:::['3-14-168']
not that i even care. i don't.:::['3-14-169']
phoebe, why don't you just call her?:::['3-14-170']
you obviously want to.:::['3-14-171']
you think you know me so well.:::['3-14-172']
well, don't you wanna? yeah.:::['3-14-173']
okay, so i do know you. that's what i said.:::['3-14-174']
well, so? i can't.:::['3-14-175']
i can't. she dumped me.:::['3-14-176']
i mean, i totally trusted her, and then one day it was like::::['3-14-177']
"okay, bye, pheebs." gone.:::['3-14-178']
you know what the saddest part is? when we were playing together......that was like the most fun:::['3-14-179']
i've ever had in, like, all my lives.:::['3-14-180']
so good to me, i wear them every day:::['3-14-181']
down at the heel, holes in the toes don't care what people say:::['3-14-182']
my feet's best friend pals to the end:::['3-14-183']
with them, i'm one hot chickie:::['3-14-184']
though late one night not much light:::['3-14-185']
i stepped in something icky:::['3-14-186']
both: sticky shoes, sticky shoes:::['3-14-187']
always make me smile:::['3-14-188']
sticky shoes, sticky shoes next time i'll:::['3-14-189']
avoid the:::['3-14-190']
pile:::['3-14-191']
man: we're beginning to see a lot of layering of sheer fabrics and colors.:::['3-14-192']
for instance, a sheer navy blouse over a pink...:::['3-14-193']
i'm really glad we came.:::['3-14-194']
wow, that's great.:::['3-14-201']
oh, yeah? you know, you could totally sell this.:::['3-14-202']
it'd be perfect for, like, um, a kitty-litter campaign.:::['3-14-203']
a jingle? no, no, no.:::['3-14-204']
why not? you make a ton of money.:::['3-14-205']
okay, if i was in this for the money, i'd be a millionaire by now, you know?:::['3-14-206']
you gotta get out of that jingle-head, sweetie.:::['3-14-207']
ugh. you're right. you're right. i'm sorry.:::['3-14-208']
all right, i'm gonna play a song now that's really, really sad.:::['3-14-210']
leslie: okay. okay, it's called "magician box mix-up.":::['3-14-211']
man: oversized bracelets, oversized earrings......oversizing of accessories in general:::['3-14-212']
is very popular now.:::['3-14-213']
oh, can i borrow this? my milk's gone bad.:::['3-14-215']
oh, i hate that.:::['3-14-216']
i once had a thing of half-and-half. stole my car.:::['3-14-217']
so how was your date with ginger?:::['3-14-218']
great. ahem. it was great. she's, uh...:::['3-14-219']
she's great. great looking, great personality. she's greatness.:::['3-14-220']
sounds like she's got the, uh......whole package.:::['3-14-221']
joey told you about the leg, huh? uh-huh.:::['3-14-222']
oh, god. it freaked me out. okay? i know it shouldn't have, but it did.:::['3-14-223']
i like her. i don't wanna stop seeing her, but every so often, it's like::::['3-14-224']
"hey, you know what? where's your leg?":::['3-14-225']
i mean, i'm the smallest person in the world, aren't i?:::['3-14-226']
i'm the smallest person in the world.:::['3-14-227']
actually, he's the smallest person in the world.:::['3-14-229']
heard about the leg-burning, huh?:::['3-14-230']
it came up.:::['3-14-231']
ahem, listen, i, uh... i know it's a long shot, but......by any chance,did she find that funny?:::['3-14-232']
so i nodded off a little.:::['3-14-233']
"nodded off"? ross, you were snoring.:::['3-14-234']
my father's boat didn't make that much noise when it hit rocks.:::['3-14-235']
come on. forty-five minutes.:::['3-14-236']
forty-five minutes, the man talked about strappy-backed dresses.:::['3-14-237']
well, okay, how about four hours in a freezing museum auditorium......listening to professor pitstains:::['3-14-238']
and his::::['3-14-239']
"hey, everybody. remember that thing that's been dead for a gazillion years?:::['3-14-240']
well, here's a little bone we didn't know it had.":::['3-14-241']
first of all, it's professor pitain.:::['3-14-242']
and second of all, that little bone proved that......that particular dinosaur had wings:::['3-14-243']
but didn't fly.:::['3-14-244']
okay, you know what i just heard?:::['3-14-245']
you know what? a hundred million people went to see a movie about what i do.:::['3-14-247']
i wonder how many people would go see a movie called jurassic parka.:::['3-14-248']
oh, that is so...:::['3-14-249']
no, no, no. a bunch of out-of-control jackets......take over an island.:::['3-14-250']
you know, if what i do is so lame......then why did you insist on coming:::['3-14-251']
with me this morning?:::['3-14-252']
huh? was it so i just wouldn't go with mark?:::['3-14-253']
i... i wanted to be with you.:::['3-14-255']
i don't know. i feel like lately...:::['3-14-256']
i feel like you're slipping away from me......with this new job:::['3-14-257']
and all these new people.:::['3-14-258']
and you've got this whole other life going on.:::['3-14-259']
i know it's dumb......but i just hate that i'm not a part of it.:::['3-14-260']
it's not dumb.:::['3-14-261']
but maybe it's okay that you're not a part of it.:::['3-14-262']
i mean, it's like i like that you're not involved in that part of my life.:::['3-14-264']
that's a little clearer.:::['3-14-265']
honey, see, it doesn't mean that i don't love you......because i do. i love you.:::['3-14-266']
but my work, it's for me, you know?:::['3-14-268']
i'm out there on my own, and i'm doing it.:::['3-14-269']
and it's scary, but i love it because it's mine.:::['3-14-270']
but i mean, is that okay?:::['3-14-271']
you're thinking about my leg, aren't you?:::['3-14-273']
actually, i forgot. what is the deal with that again?:::['3-14-275']
look, it's okay if it bothers you.:::['3-14-276']
i mean, the only thing i need to know is how much it bothers you......because i don't like wasting my time.:::['3-14-277']
am i wasting my time?:::['3-14-278']
no. no, i don't think so. okay.:::['3-14-279']
it's just like anything else. you just have to get used to it.:::['3-14-280']
that's my nubbin.:::['3-14-282']
what's a nubbin?:::['3-14-283']
it's kind of a, uh... a third-nipple kind of thing.:::['3-14-284']
do you have three nipples?:::['3-14-285']
well, you know, two regulars, ahem......and, uh, one that barely qualifies.:::['3-14-286']
uh, what? nothing. i...:::['3-14-287']
i just remembered. i have to leave.:::['3-14-288']
you, uh...? you have to leave? now? how come?:::['3-14-289']
well, it's nubbin. nothing.:::['3-14-290']
um, you know what? i'll see you later. okay.:::['3-14-291']
oh. i thought you weren't coming.:::['3-14-294']
where were you? come here. come here.:::['3-14-295']
okay. don't get mad, okay?:::['3-14-296']
okay, don't give me a reason to get mad, okay?:::['3-14-297']
i played "smelly cat" for the people at my old ad agency. they went nuts.:::['3-14-298']
no, look. i told you that i didn't want you to try and sell it......and you just big fat did it anyway.:::['3-14-299']
god. you know what? i think, five years ago......i probably would have done anything:::['3-14-300']
to play with you.:::['3-14-301']
but i can do it by myself, right? and if i can't trust you, then just forget it.:::['3-14-302']
no. no. i don't wanna forget it.:::['3-14-303']
okay, you know what? you have to choose.:::['3-14-304']
all right? if the most important thing on the planet to you......is this cat-poopy thing,then, okay, you can have "smelly cat.":::['3-14-305']
but we won't be partners.:::['3-14-306']
so what's it gonna be?:::['3-14-307']
don't change your kitty. change your kitty litter.:::['3-14-308']
singers: it's not your fault:::['3-14-309']
sorry, pheebs. yeah.:::['3-14-310']
yeah. i actually am. yeah.:::['3-14-312']
because, you know, life's gonna hand you all kinds of stuff.:::['3-14-313']
you know, you learn your little lessons and hopefully you grow.:::['3-14-314']
you wanna hear a new song?:::['3-14-315']
yeah. oh, we'd love to.:::['3-14-316']
jingle bitch screwed me over:::['3-14-318']
go to hell, jingle whore:::['3-14-319']
go to hell, go to hell, go to hell:::['3-14-320']
that's all i have so far.:::['3-14-321']
joey: where have you been? the doctor.:::['3-14-323']
is everything okay? oh, yes.:::['3-14-324']
just had me a little nubbin-ectomy.:::['3-14-325']
yep. two nipples, no waiting.:::['3-14-326']
well. just like rachel in high school.:::['3-14-327']
come on. come on, i was kidding. it was such an obvious joke.:::['3-14-329']
that was an obvious joke.:::['3-14-330']
and i didn't think of it. why didn't i think of it?:::['3-14-331']
the source of all my powers.:::['3-14-332']
oh, dear god, what have i done?:::['3-14-333']
welcome, everybody. welcome to amazing discoveries.:::['3-4-0']
oh, oh! it's on again.:::['3-4-1']
guys, could we please not watch this? all: shh.:::['3-4-2']
folks, this ever happen to you? you go to get a nice glass of milk......but these darn cartons are so:::['3-4-3']
flinging, flanging hard to open.:::['3-4-4']
boy, you said it, mike.:::['3-4-5']
aw. aw.:::['3-4-6']
can we please turn this off? no way, kevin.:::['3-4-8']
what if i told you there's a new product that guarantees......you'll never have to open up:::['3-4-9']
milk cartons again?:::['3-4-10']
meet the milkmaster 2000.:::['3-4-11']
intrigued? you're flinging, flanging right i am.:::['3-4-13']
this is his first time. he's never used this. you're gonna see how easy this is to do.:::['3-4-14']
this works in any milk carton. wow, it is easy. ha, ha.:::['3-4-15']
now i can have milk every day.:::['3-4-16']
audience: ah.:::['3-4-17']
it's official. there are no good movies.:::['3-4-18']
so let's go to a bad one and make out.:::['3-4-19']
perhaps you would like me to turn like this so you can bunny-bump against my back?:::['3-4-21']
hey, man. what's up? maybe you can tell me.:::['3-4-23']
my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at my audition today......the first good thing she gets me in weeks.:::['3-4-24']
how could you not give me the message?:::['3-4-25']
i'll tell you, i do enjoy guilt......but it wasn't me.:::['3-4-26']
yes, it was. it was him. uh-huh.:::['3-4-27']
okay, it was me.:::['3-4-28']
how was it you? well, it was all so crazy, you know?:::['3-4-29']
chandler was in the closet counting to 10 and was up to seven......and i hadn't found a place to hide yet.:::['3-4-30']
look, i meant to tell you, and i wrote it all down on my hand. see? all of it.:::['3-4-31']
joey: yep, that's my audition. yeah.:::['3-4-32']
see? now, this is why i keep notepads everywhere.:::['3-4-33']
yep. and that's why we don't invite you to play.:::['3-4-34']
what is the great tragedy here? get yourself another appointment.:::['3-4-35']
well, estelle tried. the casting director told her i missed my chance.:::['3-4-36']
well, that is unfair.:::['3-4-37']
i'll call her. i'll tell her it was totally my fault.:::['3-4-38']
you can't. the casting director doesn't talk to friends.:::['3-4-39']
she only talks to agents. what a sad little life she must lead.:::['3-4-40']
okay. ooh.:::['3-4-41']
what are you doing? what are you doing? no, i know, i know. ooh.:::['3-4-42']
from phoebe buffay's office.:::['3-4-43']
um, is, um, anne there for phoebe?:::['3-4-44']
she'll know what it's about.:::['3-4-45']
hang up. hang up right...:::['3-4-46']
we've got a problem with joey tribbiani.:::['3-4-47']
apparently, he missed his audition. who did you speak to in my office?:::['3-4-48']
estelle? i don't know what i'm gonna do with her.:::['3-4-49']
so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment. the world does not stop.:::['3-4-50']
is anybody else scared?:::['3-4-51']
if joey loses this audition, then that is it for estelle. i don't care.:::['3-4-52']
annie, you are a doll. what time can you see him?:::['3-4-53']
i need a pen. pen.:::['3-4-54']
get the woman a pad. get the woman a pad. a pad! a pad!:::['3-4-55']
oh, now you want a pad.:::['3-4-56']
hey. hello.:::['3-4-57']
where's my boy?:::['3-4-58']
here's my boy.:::['3-4-59']
and here's his barbie.:::['3-4-60']
what's, uh...? what's my boy doing with a barbie?:::['3-4-61']
he picked it out at the toy store himself. he loves it.:::['3-4-62']
he carries it everywhere, like a security blanket.:::['3-4-63']
but with ski boots and a kicky beret.:::['3-4-64']
yeah, it's cute.:::['3-4-65']
why does he have it again?:::['3-4-66']
so he's got a doll. so what?:::['3-4-67']
unless you're afraid he's gonna grow up to be......in show business.:::['3-4-68']
this wouldn't have to do with the fact that he's being raised by two women?:::['3-4-69']
you know what? it's fine. if you're okay with the barbie thing, so am i.:::['3-4-70']
give daddy the barbie. give me the barbie. okay, how about...?:::['3-4-71']
don't you wanna play with a monster truck?:::['3-4-72']
ooh, ooh. how about a dino-soldier?:::['3-4-74']
you are so pathetic.:::['3-4-75']
why can't your son just play with his doll?:::['3-4-76']
i gotta go to work.:::['3-4-77']
has anybody seen my left boob?:::['3-4-78']
i loved that movie.:::['3-4-79']
here it is. joey, what are you doing?:::['3-4-80']
i'm sorry. it just felt nice.:::['3-4-81']
joe. joe. answer the phone.:::['3-4-82']
i only got one arm. you should do stuff for me. get me a sweater.:::['3-4-83']
just do it. it's janice.:::['3-4-84']
and if i get it, i'm gonna have to see her tonight.:::['3-4-85']
oh, that's great. i'm gonna have to see her tonight.:::['3-4-86']
why don't you wanna see janice?:::['3-4-87']
last night at dinner, when the meals came......she put half her chicken piccata:::['3-4-88']
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.:::['3-4-89']
and that's bad......because you hate chicken piccata?:::['3-4-90']
you didn't wanna share your tomatoes. tomatoes are very important to you.:::['3-4-92']
all of a sudden, we were this couple.:::['3-4-93']
and this alarm started going off in my head.:::['3-4-94']
"run for your life! get out of the building!":::['3-4-95']
ugh. men are unbelievable.:::['3-4-96']
what is it with you people?:::['3-4-97']
the minute you feel something, you have to run away?:::['3-4-98']
i know. that...:::['3-4-99']
that's why i don't wanna go tonight. i'm afraid i'm gonna say something stupid.:::['3-4-100']
oh. you mean that guy thing where you act mean and distant......until you get us to break up with you?:::['3-4-101']
hey, you know about that?:::['3-4-103']
what do i do? i wanna get past this.:::['3-4-104']
i don't wanna be afraid of the commitment thing.:::['3-4-105']
i wanna go through the tunnel to the other side.:::['3-4-106']
where there's no fear of commitment. ah.:::['3-4-107']
do we have any...?:::['3-4-108']
do we have any thoughts here?:::['3-4-109']
i've never been through the tunnel myself because......you're not allowed through:::['3-4-110']
with more than one girl in the car.:::['3-4-111']
but it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else. face your fear.:::['3-4-113']
you have a fear of heights? go to the top of the building.:::['3-4-114']
you're afraid of bugs.:::['3-4-115']
get a bug.:::['3-4-116']
you have a fear of commitment.:::['3-4-118']
so i say you go in there and you be the most committed guy there ever was.:::['3-4-119']
amazingly, that makes sense.:::['3-4-120']
do you think? oh, yeah. go for it, man.:::['3-4-121']
jump off the high dive.:::['3-4-122']
stare down the barrel of the gun. pee into the wind.:::['3-4-123']
joe, if i'm staring down the barrel of a gun......i'm gonna be pretty much peeing:::['3-4-124']
every which way.:::['3-4-125']
ooh, it's your audition from this morning.:::['3-4-126']
rachel: ooh. joey: oh.:::['3-4-127']
can i use the phone?:::['3-4-128']
sure, that's what it's there for. emergencies and, uh, pretend agents.:::['3-4-129']
come on, baby. come on.:::['3-4-130']
hi. i have phoebe buffay returning a page.:::['3-4-131']
okay, well, she's in her car. i'll have to patch you through.:::['3-4-132']
very nice touch.:::['3-4-133']
talk, talk, talk. oh, oh. um... ahem.:::['3-4-135']
hi, annie?:::['3-4-136']
fantastic.:::['3-4-137']
oh! you got it.:::['3-4-138']
um, will he work for scale, you ask me?:::['3-4-139']
well, i don't know about that.:::['3-4-140']
joey: ahem. except that i do and he will.:::['3-4-141']
great. oh, you are such a sweetheart.:::['3-4-142']
i would love to have lunch with you.:::['3-4-143']
how about we have lunch next...?:::['3-4-144']
oop, went through a tunnel. ha, ha.:::['3-4-145']
oh, thank you so much. phoebe: ha, ha.:::['3-4-147']
it was really fun. i mean, i've never talked on a car phone before.:::['3-4-148']
oh. you are so amazing. could you do me this huge favor?:::['3-4-149']
there's this one other audition i want, and estelle couldn't get me in.:::['3-4-150']
uh, i don't know. it was fun one time, but...:::['3-4-151']
come on, please? it would just be this one more.:::['3-4-152']
well, actually it's two.:::['3-4-153']
two? yeah.:::['3-4-154']
well, really it's three.:::['3-4-155']
please? you're so good at it. i love you.:::['3-4-156']
okay. but just these three, right?:::['3-4-157']
no, it's four.:::['3-4-158']
so how come you wanted to eat in tonight?:::['3-4-159']
because i wanted......to give you this.:::['3-4-160']
oh. are you a puppy!:::['3-4-161']
contact paper.:::['3-4-162']
you never know what to say when someone you're sleeping with......gives you contact paper. ha, ha.:::['3-4-163']
wait, there's more. see, the contact paper is to go......in your brand-new drawer.:::['3-4-164']
see, the drawer actually goes in my dresser.:::['3-4-165']
oh. you didn't have to do this.:::['3-4-166']
yes, i did. because you're my girlfriend......and that's what girlfriends should get.:::['3-4-168']
oh. well, i gotta buy a vowel......because, oh, my god. mwah.:::['3-4-169']
who would've thought that someday......chandler bing would buy me a drawer?:::['3-4-170']
well, not me.:::['3-4-171']
but that's what's happened. and, uh, there's more.:::['3-4-172']
we should take a trip.:::['3-4-173']
we should?:::['3-4-174']
yup. we're a couple, and that's what couples do.:::['3-4-175']
and i wanna meet your parents.:::['3-4-176']
we should take a trip with your parents.:::['3-4-177']
i don't think we need to, because you're tripping me out right now.:::['3-4-178']
are you okay? no, i am.:::['3-4-179']
ha, ha. i actually am. this is amazing.:::['3-4-180']
my entire life, i have feared this place.:::['3-4-181']
and now that i'm here, it's like, what was the big deal?:::['3-4-182']
i could probably say, "let's move in together," and i'd be okay.:::['3-4-183']
you probably want us to move in together?:::['3-4-184']
it doesn't scare me. yeah, well it scares me.:::['3-4-185']
i'm not even divorced yet. you just invited me over here for pasta......and all of a sudden:::['3-4-186']
you're talking about moving in together.:::['3-4-187']
and i wasn't even that hungry.:::['3-4-188']
you know what? it's getting really late, and i should just, um...:::['3-4-189']
don't go. i've scared you. i've said too much.:::['3-4-190']
i'm hopeless and awkward and desperate for love.:::['3-4-191']
hey, janice, it's me.:::['3-4-192']
uh, ahem.:::['3-4-193']
i wanted to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street.:::['3-4-194']
here you go, honey. this will help.:::['3-4-196']
so i catch up to her and she says......this relationship's going too fast:::['3-4-197']
and we have to slow down.:::['3-4-198']
ugh. ugh. that is never good.:::['3-4-199']
then i got all......needy and clingy.:::['3-4-200']
now, wait a minute. maybe it's not so bad. how did you leave it?:::['3-4-201']
she said she'd call me.:::['3-4-202']
ugh. welcome to our side of the tunnel.:::['3-4-204']
this ice cream tastes like crap, by the way.:::['3-4-205']
yeah, well, it's that low-cal, nondairy, soy-milk junk.:::['3-4-206']
we save the real stuff for the truly terminal cases.:::['3-4-207']
when you start getting screwed over all the time, you gotta switch to low-fat.:::['3-4-208']
so you don't think i'm terminal?:::['3-4-210']
oh, no, not at all. you're not terminal. we just need some damage control.:::['3-4-211']
okay. okay. so should i call her?:::['3-4-212']
rachel & monica: no.:::['3-4-213']
it's a critical time. if you feel yourself reaching for that phone......you go shopping,you get your butt in a bubble bath.:::['3-4-214']
if you want her back, you have got to start acting aloof.:::['3-4-215']
she has to know you're not needy.:::['3-4-216']
so, what you have to do is......you have to accidentally run into her:::['3-4-217']
on purpose......and then act aloof.:::['3-4-218']
so i'm not gonna lose her?:::['3-4-219']
oh, honey, you're not a total loser.:::['3-4-220']
i said, so i'm not gonna lose her?:::['3-4-221']
guess who's here.:::['3-4-223']
it's the toughest guy in toyland, ben.:::['3-4-224']
i'm g.i. joe:::['3-4-225']
drop the barbie. drop the barbie.:::['3-4-226']
g.i. joe? you really think he's gonna fall for that?:::['3-4-227']
g.i. joe? cool. can i play?:::['3-4-228']
look, ben. it's a toy that protects u.s. oil interests overseas.:::['3-4-229']
both: go, joe!:::['3-4-230']
hello. oh.:::['3-4-231']
phoebe, there you are. no, it's not. sorry.:::['3-4-232']
but, phoebe, wait, wait. phoebe. phoebe.:::['3-4-233']
oh, joey. oh, okay. see, i didn't recognize you......in those pants.:::['3-4-234']
that tv movie i went in for, did you hear anything?:::['3-4-235']
i think i got a shot at it.:::['3-4-236']
yes, they called. you didn't get it.:::['3-4-237']
okay? i mean, you didn't get it. i'm sorry. i'm sorry.:::['3-4-238']
that's okay. these things happen.:::['3-4-239']
but they shouldn't happen. you know what?:::['3-4-240']
you're in a terrible, terrible business.:::['3-4-241']
i don't wanna be the person who makes your face look like that. ugh.:::['3-4-242']
i'm okay. see?:::['3-4-243']
now you're sad and creepy.:::['3-4-244']
you know what? i'm sorry. i quit, okay?:::['3-4-245']
no, no, no, you can't quit. you're the best agent i ever had.:::['3-4-246']
look, rejection is part of being an actor. you can't take it personal.:::['3-4-247']
not personal? they said they'd never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent.:::['3-4-248']
they actually said that?:::['3-4-249']
yeah. oh, god, there's that face again. see? i can't do this job.:::['3-4-250']
no, this is why you have to do this job.:::['3-4-251']
agents always lie.:::['3-4-252']
estelle just says stuff like, "they went another way.":::['3-4-253']
but this? i can use this.:::['3-4-254']
i can work on a new accent.:::['3-4-255']
yeah, okay. no. if it helps you, okay. yeah.:::['3-4-256']
you'll never get me, joe!:::['3-4-257']
hello, janice.:::['3-4-260']
uh, just a bit of shopping.:::['3-4-262']
are you being british?:::['3-4-264']
why are you shopping here? you don't live in this neighborhood.:::['3-4-267']
were you here waiting for me?:::['3-4-268']
yuh-huh.:::['3-4-269']
i'm just, uh, you know......picking up some things for a party.:::['3-4-270']
barley?:::['3-4-271']
what kind of a party serves barley?:::['3-4-272']
well, i'm sorry if my friends aren't as sophisticated as yours.:::['3-4-273']
where is this party? here in chelsea.:::['3-4-274']
whose party is it?:::['3-4-275']
a woman's. what woman?:::['3-4-276']
chelsea.:::['3-4-277']
either you're seeing somebody behind my back......which would make you:::['3-4-278']
the biggest jerk on the planet......or you're pretending:::['3-4-279']
you're seeing somebody......which just makes you so pathetic:::['3-4-280']
i could just start crying right here.:::['3-4-281']
so which of these two guys do you wanna be?:::['3-4-282']
can i be that guy?:::['3-4-283']
okay, we got some more good rejections. lots of stuff to work on.:::['3-4-284']
oh. okay. shoot.:::['3-4-285']
okay. um... oh, the zoo commercial.:::['3-4-286']
i didn't get it? no.:::['3-4-287']
they said that you "weren't believable as a human being.":::['3-4-288']
so you can work on that.:::['3-4-289']
great. what else?:::['3-4-290']
um, the off-broadway-play people said that you were "pretty but dumb.":::['3-4-291']
oh. no, wait, i'm sorry. that's "pretty dumb.":::['3-4-292']
oh. look, it's okay, no, no, no. really.:::['3-4-293']
look, um......i really appreciate this, pheebs......but i'm gonna have to go back:::['3-4-294']
to estelle.:::['3-4-295']
don't get me wrong. you're a better agent than she is......but at least with her, i don't wanna:::['3-4-297']
blow my pretty dumb brains out.:::['3-4-298']
yeah, no, i understand.:::['3-4-299']
you do? thanks. okay. yeah.:::['3-4-300']
wait a minute. phoebe: what?:::['3-4-302']
did you just make all that stuff up to get out of being my agent?:::['3-4-304']
oh, he caught me.:::['3-4-305']
i am so busted.:::['3-4-306']
that's what i suspected.:::['3-4-307']
and then i just, you know......threw the bag of barley at her:::['3-4-308']
and ran out of the store.:::['3-4-309']
my god, chandler, we said be aloof, not a doof.:::['3-4-310']
i've actually ruined this, haven't i?:::['3-4-311']
it's time for the good ice cream now, right?:::['3-4-312']
yeah, it is. okay.:::['3-4-313']
you know what? everything's gonna be okay.:::['3-4-314']
can you hold on for a second?:::['3-4-317']
i don't know. this is unprecedented.:::['3-4-320']
if we ever did what you did, a man would never call.:::['3-4-321']
i got it. pretend you just woke up. that'll throw her off.:::['3-4-323']
be sleepy. yes. and grumpy.:::['3-4-324']
what are you...? stop naming dwarves.:::['3-4-325']
hello, janice. hi.:::['3-4-326']
i'm so glad that you called.:::['3-4-327']
i know i've been acting really weird lately......and it's just because:::['3-4-328']
i'm crazy about you......and i just got stupid and scared......and stupid a couple more times.:::['3-4-329']
ha, ha. really?:::['3-4-332']
he's so lucky. if janice were a guy......she'd be sleeping:::['3-4-333']
with somebody else by now.:::['3-4-334']
ugh. it's so unfair.:::['3-4-336']
g.i. joe? g.i. joe?:::['3-4-337']
hey, i don't know what to tell you guys. that's the doll he chose.:::['3-4-338']
what'd you do, dip it in sugar?:::['3-4-339']
look, g.i. joe's in, barbie's out.:::['3-4-340']
and if you guys can't deal with it, that's just your too bad.:::['3-4-341']
what are you being such a weenie for? so he has a barbie. big deal.:::['3-4-342']
you used to dress up like a woman.:::['3-4-343']
the way you used to dress up in mom's clothes?:::['3-4-345']
the big hat, the pearls, the little pink handbag?:::['3-4-347']
okay. you are totally making this up.:::['3-4-348']
how can you not remember?:::['3-4-349']
you made us call you "bea"?:::['3-4-350']
i've literally never been this happy.:::['3-4-352']
wasn't there a little song?:::['3-4-353']
oh, please, god, let there be a song.:::['3-4-354']
there was no song. there was no song.:::['3-4-355']
i am bea:::['3-4-356', '3-4-363']
i drink tea... that's enough.:::['3-4-357']
monica: won't you?:::['3-4-358']
won't you?:::['3-4-360', '3-4-361']
won't you dance around with me? ha-ha-ha.:::['3-4-362']
i drink tea:::['3-4-364']
won't you dance around with...?:::['3-4-365']
so, what happened? did a forest tick you off?:::['3-5-2']
you know how we're always saying we need a place for the mail.:::['3-5-4']
well, i started building one.:::['3-5-6']
but then i decided to take it to the next step.:::['3-5-7']
you're building a post office?:::['3-5-8']
no, an entertainment unit, with a mail cubby built right in.:::['3-5-9']
it's a one-day job, max. okay.:::['3-5-10']
my word, those are snug.:::['3-5-11']
oh, yeah. these are my old work pants.:::['3-5-12']
sergio valente.:::['3-5-13']
power saw kind of got away from me there.:::['3-5-14']
any sign of your brother? no, but he's always late, so...:::['3-5-16']
i thought you only met him once. yeah, i did.:::['3-5-17']
i think it sounds, you know, big sister-y, "frank's always late." so...:::['3-5-18']
oh. well, relax. he'll be here.:::['3-5-19']
yeah, no, i know. i'm just nervous. rachel: oh.:::['3-5-20']
you know, it's just, you know, mom's dead, don't talk to my sister......grandma's been sleeping:::['3-5-21']
a lot lately.:::['3-5-22']
it's just the "last desperate chance to have a family" kind of thing.:::['3-5-23']
mm. you're so sweet to wait with me.:::['3-5-24']
well, actually, gunther sent me. you're not allowed to have cups out here.:::['3-5-25']
does anyone else think david copperfield's cute?:::['3-5-26']
no, but he told me he thinks you're a fox.:::['3-5-27']
all right. janice likes him.:::['3-5-28']
in fact, she likes him so much, she put him on her, uh, freebie list.:::['3-5-29']
we have a deal where we each pick five different celebrities we could sleep with......and the other one can't get mad.:::['3-5-31']
ah, the heart of every healthy relationship::::['3-5-32']
honesty, respect, and sex with celebrities.:::['3-5-33']
so, chandler, who's on your list?:::['3-5-34']
uh, kim basinger......cindy crawford, halle berry......yasmine bleeth...:::['3-5-35']
...and jessica rabbit.:::['3-5-37']
ahem. now, you do realize that she is a cartoon and way out of your league?:::['3-5-38']
i know. i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head.:::['3-5-39']
hey, monica, who would yours be?:::['3-5-40']
first i need a boyfriend. then i can have a list.:::['3-5-41']
it's just a game, mon.:::['3-5-42']
rach, how about you?:::['3-5-43']
oh, i don't know. i guess chris o'donnell, john f. kennedy jr......daniel day-lewis, sting:::['3-5-44']
and parker stevenson.:::['3-5-45']
spider-man?:::['3-5-46']
hardy boy.:::['3-5-47']
peter parker. thank you.:::['3-5-48']
what about you, honey? who'd be on your list?:::['3-5-49']
i... oh, that kind of thing requires some serious thought.:::['3-5-50']
first, i'll divide my prospective candidates into categories.:::['3-5-51']
ahem. what a geek.:::['3-5-52']
everybody, this is frank. this is my half brother, frank.:::['3-5-53']

phoebe: this is monica. whoa.:::['3-5-59']
and this is rachel. hi.:::['3-5-60']
i'm gonna get coffee for us.:::['3-5-62']
hey, how do you guys get anything done? ha, ha.:::['3-5-63']
we don't, really.:::['3-5-64']
well, so do you guys have big plans?:::['3-5-65']
oh, yeah. we're gonna, like, connect and, you know, bond and everything.:::['3-5-66']
i was thinking we could go down to times square and pick up some ninja stars.:::['3-5-67']
oh, um, my friend larry, he wants me to take a picture of a hooker.:::['3-5-68']
you know, we really don't take advantage of living in the city.:::['3-5-69']
oh, sorry. did i get you?:::['3-5-70']
no, you didn't get me.:::['3-5-71']
it's an electric drill. you get me, you kill me!:::['3-5-72']
calm down. do you want this unit or not?:::['3-5-73']
i do not want this unit.:::['3-5-74']
well, you should've told me before. i'm not a mind reader.:::['3-5-75']
and we're out of beer. okay, i'm going to monica's.:::['3-5-76']
chandler: fine.:::['3-5-77']
hey. where you heading in those pants?:::['3-5-78']
oh, monica, listen......i saw down at the hardware store:::['3-5-79']
they got those designer tiles on sale......if you wanna redo your bathroom floor.:::['3-5-80']
what's wrong with my bathroom floor?:::['3-5-81']
nothing. it's just old and dingy, that's all.:::['3-5-82']
i highly doubt that. oh, yeah?:::['3-5-83']
if you move your hamper, you can see the color the tile used to be.:::['3-5-84']
ah! yeah.:::['3-5-85']
i can't live like this. what are we gonna do?:::['3-5-86']
relax, relax. here, hold this.:::['3-5-87']
this old stuff comes right up. i'll show you.:::['3-5-88']
a little more than i wanted to see.:::['3-5-89']
look at that. every inch of this is glued down.:::['3-5-90']
it'd take forever to pry this up. you should, uh... you should just leave it.:::['3-5-91']
i can't leave it. you gouged a hole in my dingy floor.:::['3-5-92']
uh, oh.:::['3-5-93']
ah? there you go. aw.:::['3-5-94']
yeah, that's nice.:::['3-5-95']
you know, we can put it back there after the surgeons remove it from your colon.:::['3-5-96']
ooh, ooh!:::['3-5-97']
i know what i wanted to ask you. can you roll your tongue?:::['3-5-99']
because i can and my mom couldn't.:::['3-5-100']
and i thought, you know... i figured that was something i got from our dad.:::['3-5-101']
well, wait, you mean like this? yeah.:::['3-5-102']
yeah, you can do it too. yeah.:::['3-5-103']
you're not doing it.:::['3-5-104']
oh, right, okay. yeah, my mom could and i can't.:::['3-5-105']
so we don't have that.:::['3-5-106']
when's your birthday? february 16th.:::['3-5-107']
i know a guy who's the 18th.:::['3-5-108']
that's close.:::['3-5-109']
when's yours? october 25th.:::['3-5-110']
that's the same month as halloween.:::['3-5-111']
so, what kind of things do you like to do at home?:::['3-5-113']
melt stuff.:::['3-5-114']
okay, i've got three of my five. three of your five what?:::['3-5-115']
celebrities i'm allowed to sleep with.:::['3-5-116']
god, you are giving this a lot of thought.:::['3-5-117']
hey, it's hard, okay? i only have two spots left.:::['3-5-118']
all right. who you got it narrowed down to?:::['3-5-119']
okay. ahem. elizabeth hurley.:::['3-5-120']
ooh, very attractive. yeah.:::['3-5-121']
forgiving.:::['3-5-122']
susan sarandon.:::['3-5-123']
eh, you know what? she's too political.:::['3-5-124']
she probably wouldn't let you do it unless you donated four cans of food first.:::['3-5-125']
and isabella rossellini.:::['3-5-126']
ooh. ooh. very hot. very sexy.:::['3-5-127']
but, uh, you know, she's too international. she's never gonna be around.:::['3-5-128']
so? so you gotta play the odds.:::['3-5-129']
pick somebody who's gonna be in the country, like, all the time.:::['3-5-130']
yeah. because that's why you won't get isabella rossellini. geography.:::['3-5-131']
okay, so by "melting," you meant melting.:::['3-5-132']
so is it, like, art? yeah, you can melt art.:::['3-5-134']
hey, can i use your phone? mm.:::['3-5-135']
yeah, sure. you wanna call your mom? no, i wanna melt it.:::['3-5-136']
oh. well, um, not right now.:::['3-5-137']
you know what? i'm just gonna go to bed. the fumes are giving me a headache. so...:::['3-5-138']
yeah. yeah. ha, ha.:::['3-5-139']
good night, bro.:::['3-5-140']
just in case.:::['3-5-143']
what kind of karate is that? no kind.:::['3-5-145']
he just makes it up. hmm.:::['3-5-146']
so how's it going with you guys? so far it kind of blows.:::['3-5-147']
i don't know, i just thought, you know, that he'd feel more like a brother.:::['3-5-148']
like you and ross. just close and connected and...:::['3-5-149']
oh. we're close now, but you wouldn't believe the years......of noogies and wedgies and:::['3-5-150']
flying wedgies and atomic wedgies and...:::['3-5-151']
that's when the waistband actually goes over your head.:::['3-5-152']
we drove each other crazy playing the shadow game.:::['3-5-154']
how do you play the shadow game? how do you play the shadow game?:::['3-5-155']
i just asked you. i just asked you.:::['3-5-156']
i don't have time for this.:::['3-5-157']
no, that is what the game is. well, you just gave up really quickly.:::['3-5-158']
have you seen joey? what's the matter?:::['3-5-159']
oh, just this.:::['3-5-160']
it's my fault, really, because the couch is where we usually keep the varnish.:::['3-5-161']
joey: hey, somebody wanna hand me one of those tiles?:::['3-5-162']

jasmine: fine.:::['3-5-224']
i don't like you.:::['3-5-225']
so that's what you thought i did? god.:::['3-5-226']
that's not what i do.:::['3-5-227']
wait, that... wait, that's not what you do?:::['3-5-228']
why would you think that?:::['3-5-230']
i don't know. i mean, you know... this is the city, you know? i just...:::['3-5-231']
i mean, uh......i don't know.:::['3-5-232']
whatever. it's the perfect end to the perfect weekend anyway.:::['3-5-233']
no, you're right. no, it was perfect.:::['3-5-235']
i can't believe that i screwed it up so bad.:::['3-5-236']
you really thought it was perfect?:::['3-5-237']
well, no, maybe it wasn't perfect......but, you know, it was pretty cool,you know?:::['3-5-238']
because we had all those great talks, you know?:::['3-5-239']
yeah. um...:::['3-5-240']
which ones in particular were great for you?:::['3-5-241']
well, you know, about the tongue thing, you know?:::['3-5-242']
and how i told you about my likes and my dislikes.:::['3-5-243']
i don't...:::['3-5-244']
how i like to melt stuff and how i dislike stuff that doesn't melt.:::['3-5-245']
right. okay. mm-hm.:::['3-5-246']
you know, i feel like i can really talk to you......because, you know,you're my sister, you know?:::['3-5-247']
yeah. i guess i do. yeah.:::['3-5-248']
and then i go feel your friend up and make you mad at me.:::['3-5-249']
yeah, well, i wasn't hopping mad, you know?:::['3-5-250']
you hopped a little bit.:::['3-5-251']
yeah, i'm really sorry. you know, i'm really...:::['3-5-252']
well, this is my favorite part of the weekend. right now. this.:::['3-5-254']
this? uh-huh.:::['3-5-255']
oh, come on. we went to times square.:::['3-5-256']
we found ninja stars. i almost get my arm broken by a hooker...:::['3-5-257']
she's not a hooker.:::['3-5-258']
well, when i tell my friends about her, she will be.:::['3-5-259']
okay. on three.:::['3-5-260']
one, two...:::['3-5-261', '3-5-267']
why don't we just go on two?:::['3-5-262']
why two? because it's faster.:::['3-5-263']
yeah, i could've counted to three four times without all this two talk.:::['3-5-264']
all right, but in the future... okay. heavy thing not getting lighter.:::['3-5-265']
so we are going with two? all right.:::['3-5-268']
oh, good job, joe.:::['3-5-269']
it's big.:::['3-5-271']
yeah. yeah, so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller.:::['3-5-272']
maybe my ruler's wrong.:::['3-5-273']
maybe all the rulers are wrong.:::['3-5-274']
look, it's not that bad.:::['3-5-275']
so what? it blocks a little of your door, a little of my door.:::['3-5-276']
i got a better idea.:::['3-5-277']
how about it blocks none of my door and a lot of your door?:::['3-5-278']
listen, before i forget, that side is still wet.:::['3-5-279']
okay, ahem, let me just see if i've got this right.:::['3-5-280']
so this is a half-caf, double-tall, easy-hazelnut......nonfat, no foam, with whip,extra-hot latte, right?:::['3-5-281']
ahem. you freak.:::['3-5-283']
thank you. ahem. a coffee to go, please.:::['3-5-284']
oh, my god. guys.:::['3-5-285']
isabella rossellini.:::['3-5-286']
are you serious? oh, my god.:::['3-5-287']
damn. i cannot believe i took her off my list.:::['3-5-288']
why? because otherwise you'd go for it?:::['3-5-289']
oh, heh. you lie.:::['3-5-291']
you don't think i'd go up to her?:::['3-5-292']
ross, it took you 10 years to finally admit you liked me.:::['3-5-293']
yeah? well, missy, you better be glad that list is laminated. heh.:::['3-5-294']
you know what, honey? you go ahead. we'll call her an alternate.:::['3-5-295']
okay. hold my cruller. okay.:::['3-5-296']
rach, are you really gonna let him do this?:::['3-5-297']
honey, he's about to go hit on isabella rossellini.:::['3-5-298']
i'm just sorry we don't got popcorn.:::['3-5-299']
um, you don't know me, but i'm a big, big fan of yours.:::['3-5-302']
i mean, um, blue velvet. whoo.:::['3-5-303']
i was wondering if i could maybe buy you a, um, cup of coffee.:::['3-5-304']
or reimburse you for that one.:::['3-5-305']
aren't you with that girl over there?:::['3-5-306']
well, yeah, kind of.:::['3-5-307']
but that's okay. see, we have an understanding.:::['3-5-308']
see, we each have this list of five famous people......and you were one of mine.:::['3-5-309']
so i'm allowed to sleep with you.:::['3-5-310']
no, no, no. it's flattering.:::['3-5-311']
whoa. heh, heh.:::['3-5-312']
i don't know... no, no, no. wait. wait, isabella.:::['3-5-313']
don't just dismiss this so fast.:::['3-5-314']
i mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.:::['3-5-315']
yeah, for you.:::['3-5-316']
is that the list?:::['3-5-317']
um, yes. can i see it?:::['3-5-318']
um, no. come on.:::['3-5-319']
but... okay.:::['3-5-320']
i'm not on the list.:::['3-5-321']
um, see, but that's not the final draft.:::['3-5-322']
it's laminated.:::['3-5-323']
um, okay, see, you were on my list.:::['3-5-325']

that you are international.:::['3-5-327']
so i bumped you for winona ryder. local.:::['3-5-328']

chloe, switch with me. there are some guys here who got a crush on you.:::['3-15-37']
okay, that hurt us.:::['3-15-38']

no, no, not him. no, you don't.:::['3-15-61']
okay. well, the moment's over.:::['3-15-62']
mischa: oy.:::['3-15-64']
phoebe: see, there it is right there.:::['3-15-65']
wow, it's small.:::['3-15-66']
yeah, but sergei said it took the germans six weeks......to get all the way across it.:::['3-15-67']
so you had fun, huh?:::['3-15-68']
yeah. except for, you know, when you're on a date......and you're getting along really great......but the guy's translator:::['3-15-69']
keeps getting in the way?:::['3-15-70']
what, is, uh, rach in her room?:::['3-15-73']
oh. no, she's still at work, but she told me to tell you to call her.:::['3-15-74']
oh, what? is she gonna cancel on me again? how could she do this?:::['3-15-75']
doesn't she know it's our anniversary?:::['3-15-76']
all right, uh, ross, this is the extent of my knowledge on the subject.:::['3-15-77']
"call rachel.":::['3-15-78']
what's that on the bottom?:::['3-15-79']
oh. that's my doodle of a ladybug with a top hat. ha, ha.:::['3-15-80']
she's fancy.:::['3-15-81']
hello? ross: hey, honey.:::['3-15-82']
oh, hi. hey. what's going on?:::['3-15-83']
well, there was a disaster in shipping and i've gotta get this order in.:::['3-15-84']
honey, i'm so sorry, but it looks like i'm gonna be here all night.:::['3-15-85']
what? well, um, how about i come up there?:::['3-15-86']
no, no, no, honey, please. i just have too much to deal with.:::['3-15-87']
anyway, i'm going out with sergei again tonight, and, um...:::['3-15-88']
could you come and be the translator's date?:::['3-15-89']
so that when we... you know, it's time for our alone time, you two can split off?:::['3-15-90']
you know, he's kind of cute.:::['3-15-91']
"kind of cute" like, "really kind of cute"?:::['3-15-92']
or "kind of cute" like your friend spackle-back larry?:::['3-15-93']
hey, don't call him that.:::['3-15-94']
his name is spackle-back harry.:::['3-15-95']
hey, you know what? maybe we should get going.:::['3-15-96']
i mean, what time did chloe say to get there?:::['3-15-97']
uh, 10:30. what time is it now?:::['3-15-98']
four-thirty.:::['3-15-99']
yeah, all right. so we'll hang out. yeah.:::['3-15-100']
hey, remember when she brought up that thing about the three of us?:::['3-15-101']
yes, vividly.:::['3-15-102']
she was kidding about that, right? yeah, i think so.:::['3-15-103']
yeah, i think so.:::['3-15-104']
god, it'd be weird if that situation presented itself tonight, huh?:::['3-15-105']
yeah. yeah, i mean, uh......what would we do?:::['3-15-106']
ha, ha. dude, i don't know. ha-ha-ha.:::['3-15-107']
she was kidding. yeah.:::['3-15-108']
just in case, we should come up with a set of ground rules.:::['3-15-110']
yeah. for sure.:::['3-15-111']
okay. you probably want the first one to be::::['3-15-112']
"never open your eyes.":::['3-15-113']
you know? because you don't want to be doing something......and then look up, right?:::['3-15-114']
and see something that you don't want to be seeing.:::['3-15-115']
yeah. good call. nice.:::['3-15-116']
hold it. hold it.:::['3-15-117']
what if my eyes are closed, and...:::['3-15-118']
and my hand is out there...:::['3-15-119']
aah! okay, eyes open at all times.:::['3-15-120']
oh, hey.:::['3-15-121']
how do we decide where we, ahem......you know, each would, ahem,you know......be?:::['3-15-122']
right. right.:::['3-15-123']
well, you know, we could flip for it.:::['3-15-124']
i guess. but, like, what's heads and what's tails?:::['3-15-125']
well, if you don't know that, then i don't want to do this with you.:::['3-15-126']
no, no, no. i am looking at a purchase order right here......and it clearly states:::['3-15-127']
that we ordered the riviera bikini......in a variety of sizes and colors and...:::['3-15-128']
what does it matter what i'm wearing?:::['3-15-129']

how about a glass of wine by the fire? i can get it going again...:::['3-15-157']
ross, you're not listening. i don't have time to stop.:::['3-15-158']
come on, you don't have 10 minutes? i don't have 10 minutes.:::['3-15-159']
sophie, does she have 10 minutes? hey, ross. i told you, i don't.:::['3-15-160']
don't yell at me, okay? this is the most i've seen you all week.:::['3-15-161']

look, um, about what happened earlier...:::['3-15-167']
whoa. i completely understand. you were stressed.:::['3-15-168']
i was gonna give you a chance to apologize to me.:::['3-15-169']
for what? for letting you throw me out of your office?:::['3-15-170']
you had no right coming down to my office, ross.:::['3-15-171']
you do not bring a picnic basket to somebody's work......unless maybe they were a park ranger.:::['3-15-172']
yeah, well, excuse me for wanting to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.:::['3-15-173']
boy, what an ass am i.:::['3-15-174']
but i told you i didn't have the time. yeah, well, you never have the time.:::['3-15-175']
i mean, i don't feel like i have a girlfriend anymore.:::['3-15-176']
ross, what do you want from me?:::['3-15-177']
you want me to quit my job so you can feel like you have a girlfriend?:::['3-15-178', '3-16-1']
no. but it would nice if you'd realize that it's just a job.:::['3-15-179']
just a job?:::['3-15-180']
ross, do you realize this is the first time in my life i'm doing something i care about?:::['3-15-182']
this is the first time in my life i'm doing something i'm actually good at?:::['3-15-183']
i mean, if you don't get that...:::['3-15-184']
no, hey, i get that. okay? i get that and i'm happy for you.:::['3-15-185']
i'm tired of having a relationship with your answering machine.:::['3-15-186']
i cannot keep having this same fight over and over again, ross.:::['3-15-191']
no, you're making this too hard.:::['3-15-192']
i'm making this too hard? what do you want me to do?:::['3-15-193']
i don't know. i don't know.:::['3-15-194']
look, ugh, maybe we should just take a break.:::['3-15-195', '3-16-5']
okay, okay. fine. you're right.:::['3-15-196']
let's, uh... let's take a break. let's cool off, okay?:::['3-15-197']
a break from us.:::['3-15-200', '3-16-8']
and the advances in collating in the past five years.:::['3-15-201']
i mean, we just got in an x-5000, you know?:::['3-15-202']
the x-5000 makes an x-50 look like a t-71.:::['3-15-203']
hey, it's the dinosaur guy.:::['3-15-204']
hi, ross. oh, hi, chloe.:::['3-15-205']
i want you to meet some friends of mine.:::['3-15-206']
this guy's my hero. he comes in with some stuff......he wants it blown up 400 percent.:::['3-15-207']
we say we don't do that. he says, "you gotta.":::['3-15-208']
and you know what? we did it.:::['3-15-209']
and now any time anybody wants 400, we just say, "let's ross it.":::['3-15-210']
and that's the only color that comes in.:::['3-15-211']
yo, chloe. do you have a quarter for the condom machine?:::['3-15-212']
so, what are you doing here?:::['3-15-213']
i thought tonight was your big anniversary dinner.:::['3-15-214']
yeah, a little change of plans. uh, we're gonna break up instead.:::['3-15-215']
oh, and i can also speak a little french.:::['3-15-216']
why? what did i say?:::['3-15-217']
well, you just asked if i wanted to go to bed with you tonight.:::['3-15-218']
oh, my god. mischa: heh.:::['3-15-219']
no wonder i get such great service at café maurice.:::['3-15-220']
hi. um, could you please tell sergei that, um, i was fascinated......by what boutros boutros-ghali:::['3-15-222']
said in the new york times?:::['3-15-223']
you didn't say, "boutros boutros-ghali.":::['3-15-224']
boutros boutros-ghali.:::['3-15-225']
he says he was too.:::['3-15-226']
mischa: uh, so i was wondering...:::['3-15-228']
before you get all talky again......um, could you also please:::['3-15-229']
tell sergei......that i really like his suit.:::['3-15-230']
uh, he said, "thank you very much. you look very pretty tonight.:::['3-15-231']
your hair, golden like the sun." so you're a chef?:::['3-15-232']
i'm also thinking of opening up my own restaurant.:::['3-15-233']
oh, really? monica......could i talk to you behind my menu,please?:::['3-15-234']
what are you doing? well, i was having a conversation.:::['3-15-235']
yeah, but mischa's so interested in you......that sergei and i haven't been able:::['3-15-236']
to say two words to each other.:::['3-15-237']
what do you want me to do? sit here while the three of you have a conversation?:::['3-15-238']
that would be great. thank you.:::['3-15-239']
hello? oh, hi. it's mark.:::['3-15-240']
oh. what? is it my breath?:::['3-15-241']

you wanna talk? i mean, i can come over.:::['3-15-248']
no, really, no. please. that's okay.:::['3-15-249']
all right. i'm coming over and i'm bringing chinese food.:::['3-15-250']
oh, yeah, i'm not hungry. it's for me.:::['3-15-251']
so, what'll you do? what can i do?:::['3-15-255']
one person wants to break up, you break up.:::['3-15-256']
hey, no way. come on, this is you guys. call her and work it out.:::['3-15-257']
come on. we just had this huge fight. don't i have to wait a while?:::['3-15-258']
hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat. pick up your phone.:::['3-15-259']
you know that whole swimming thing is a myth.:::['3-15-260']
yeah, tell that to my uncle lenny.:::['3-15-261']
why? what happened to him?:::['3-15-262']
nothing. he just really believes in that.:::['3-15-263']
ugh. and then we got into this big, stupid fight... it was awful.:::['3-15-264']
i told him he treats me like a park ranger, something, ugh...:::['3-15-265']
and then......i told him i wanted to take a break.:::['3-15-266']
i don't want to take a break.:::['3-15-267', '3-16-10']
egg roll? no.:::['3-15-269']
and then i called him, and he wasn't there.:::['3-15-270']
he's probably just out.:::['3-15-271']
oh, thank you. that's very helpful. i'm glad you came over.:::['3-15-272']
hello? hi, it's me.:::['3-15-273']
hi. oh, i'm so glad you called. really?:::['3-15-274']
i've been thinking this is crazy. don't you think we can work on this?:::['3-15-275']
hey, what do you want to drink?:::['3-15-276']
nobody?:::['3-15-278']
is it okay if i finish the apple juice?:::['3-15-279']
is that mark?:::['3-15-280']
ooh, honey, look, he just came over... yeah, got it.:::['3-15-281']
hey, dinosaur guy. look at you, so sad.:::['3-15-282']
come dance. uh, that's okay. thanks.:::['3-15-283']
you don't have to smile. you just have to dance.:::['3-15-285']
look, i don't feel like dancing. i feel like having a drink, okay?:::['3-15-286']
oh, okay. hey, two beers.:::['3-15-287']
and the vet said it was time.:::['3-15-288']
and so from half-a-world away......while my mother:::['3-15-289']
held the phone to his ear......i said goodbye to my dog......in seven languages.:::['3-15-290']
could i have a tissue? oh, yeah, sure.:::['3-15-291']
i just hope you don't accidentally suck it up through your nose......and choke on it.:::['3-15-292']
ugh. sergei would like to apologize for my behavior tonight.:::['3-15-293']
well, tell him, "apology accepted.":::['3-15-294']
he's unbelievable. for the first time in three years, someone wants to talk to me.:::['3-15-295']
but do you think he would let me enjoy that? no.:::['3-15-296']
you silly diplomat. why don't you learn some english, sergei?:::['3-15-297']
excuse me, but, um, ahem, isn't he paying for your dinner?:::['3-15-298']
hey, the man's dog just died.:::['3-15-299']
i have just resigned my post.:::['3-15-300']
would you care to accompany me to the rainbow room?:::['3-15-301']
i have diplomatic coupons.:::['3-15-302']
it would be my pleasure.:::['3-15-303']
my guy has coupons.:::['3-15-304']
your guy can't even say "coupons.":::['3-15-305']
uh, plate.:::['3-15-307']
plate. yes. plate. plate. plate. plate.:::['3-15-308']
plate.:::['3-15-309']
see, we don't need them.:::['3-15-310']
plate?:::['3-15-311']
sleight of hand and twist of fate:::['3-15-314']
on a bed of nails she makes me wait:::['3-15-315']
i like this song.:::['3-15-316']
well, you're practically dancing already.:::['3-15-317']
why don't you just do it over here? oh, no.:::['3-15-318']
what are you, married? ha, ha.:::['3-15-319']
because that's okay.:::['3-15-320']
oh, be home, be home, be home...:::['3-15-321']
be home, be home, be home.:::['3-15-322']
you're not home.:::['3-15-323']
with or without you:::['3-15-324']
still no smile?:::['3-15-325']
and you give yourself away:::['3-15-326', '3-15-328']
and you give:::['3-15-327']
in foreign language]:::['3-15-329']
american.:::['3-15-330']
american. american.:::['3-15-331']
american. you know, it's a very hard language.:::['3-15-332']
let's do it again.:::['3-15-333']
can i see the comics?:::['3-17-0']
this is the new york times.:::['3-17-1']
okay, may i see the comics?:::['3-17-2']
i thought you were taking ross to the game.:::['3-17-3']
we are. he's meeting us here. no, rachel's meeting us here.:::['3-17-4']
come on. they can be in the same room.:::['3-17-5']
you should've been there last night. what happened?:::['3-17-6']
ross was hanging out at our place.:::['3-17-7']
rachel comes to borrow moisturizer from chandler...:::['3-17-8']
how hard is it to say "something"?:::['3-17-10']
rachel came over to borrow "something.":::['3-17-11']
anyway, her and ross just started yelling at each other.:::['3-17-12']
why was he yelling at her? he slept with someone else.:::['3-17-13']
he says they were on a break when it happened......so she should've:::['3-17-14']
forgiven him by now.:::['3-17-15']
he is so unreasonable. god.:::['3-17-16']
although i understand what he means.:::['3-17-17']
oh, my god. this is like 60 minutes......when at first you're mad:::['3-17-18']
at that pharmaceutical company......for making the drug.:::['3-17-19']
and then, you just feel bad for the people because......they needed:::['3-17-20']
to make their hair grow.:::['3-17-21']
you know, this is like when my parents got divorced.:::['3-17-22']
i hope ross doesn't try to kidnap me after cub scouts.:::['3-17-23']
i dreamed that ross and rachel were still together.:::['3-17-24']
and we were all hanging out and happy.:::['3-17-25']
i had the same dream.:::['3-17-26']
and nobody slept with the xerox girl. oh, i had the opposite dream.:::['3-17-27']
maybe it's gonna be okay. i mean, it's been a week.:::['3-17-28']
it never takes me more than a week to get over a relationship.:::['3-17-29']
it never takes you more than a shower to get over a relationship.:::['3-17-30']
let's go. let's hit the road. let's get the show on it.:::['3-17-31']
let me get coffee.:::['3-17-32']
i know the best coffeehouse. and it's close.:::['3-17-33']
closer than here?:::['3-17-34']
oh, look. i found coffee.:::['3-17-35']
okay, let's skedaddle.:::['3-17-36']
i'm not gonna drink somebody's old coffee.:::['3-17-37']
okay, your highness.:::['3-17-38']
"rachel, i'm really sorry." "okay, ross. wanna get back together?":::['3-17-39']
"yeah, okay.":::['3-17-40']
did anyone else hear that?:::['3-17-41']
is he here? no.:::['3-17-42']
here's your moisturizer.:::['3-17-43']
you guys are gonna love me. okay, check it out.:::['3-17-45']
thursday night, five tickets.:::['3-17-46']
calvin klein lingerie show, and you guys are coming with me.:::['3-17-47']
i said that out loud, right?:::['3-17-48']
yes, it's just that we kind of already......made plans with ross.:::['3-17-49']
rachel: oh. well, okay.:::['3-17-50']
it's just, he got this new home-theater dealy......and he wants us to check it out.:::['3-17-52']
he's excited about it too.:::['3-17-53']
he even recorded showtimes on his answering machine.:::['3-17-54']
we're sorry, honey. rachel: oh, it's okay.:::['3-17-55']
rach, it's not that we don't want to. really.:::['3-17-56']
are we talking models in their underwear?:::['3-17-57']
and heels.:::['3-17-58']
ross did ask us first, and we set that night aside.:::['3-17-59']
come on. if he asked you first, it's only fair.:::['3-17-60']
phoebe: oh, boy, do i feel bad.:::['3-17-61']
monica: very bad.:::['3-17-62']
chandler, what are you doing? chandler.:::['3-17-63']
you're smoking again?:::['3-17-65']
well, actually, yesterday i was smoking again.:::['3-17-66']
today i'm smoking, still.:::['3-17-67']
why would you start again after chewing all that quitting gum?:::['3-17-68']
this is just like my parents' divorce......which is when:::['3-17-69']
i first started smoking.:::['3-17-70']
weren't you 9?:::['3-17-71']
i'm telling you something, that first smoke after naptime...:::['3-17-73']
that's great. with my luck, that's him.:::['3-17-74']
him? ross?:::['3-17-75']
no, "hymn" 253: "his eyes are on the sparrow.":::['3-17-76']
when my parents got divorced, i started using humor as a defense mechanism.:::['3-17-77']
hi. uh, do you guys have weekend plans?:::['3-17-78']
because my sister says we can spend the weekend at her cabin, skiing.:::['3-17-79']
i'm asking you first, right? i'm playing by the rules.:::['3-17-80']
monica: absolutely.:::['3-17-81']
chandler. you're smoking? what are you doing?:::['3-17-82']
shut up. you're not my real mom.:::['3-17-83']
could you close that window? my nipples could cut glass.:::['3-17-84']
really? because mine get me out of tickets.:::['3-17-85']
look, i just wanna say i really appreciate you spending time with me.:::['3-17-86']
it's been a hard time right now, so i just want to say thanks.:::['3-17-87']
somebody else hug him. i have to stay by the window.:::['3-17-88']
oh, hey, hey.:::['3-17-89']
how about this weekend, we have a laser-disc marathon, okay?:::['3-17-90']
and maybe a tournament on my new......dart board. what do you think?:::['3-17-91']
two days of darts. it'll be great.:::['3-17-92']
it'll be great for next weekend.:::['3-17-93', '3-17-95']
this weekend, guys.:::['3-17-94']
i mean, "lt'll be great.":::['3-17-96']
we're, um, sort of invited to go skiing. you know, rachel's sister's cabin?:::['3-17-98']
so, for the whole weekend?:::['3-17-99']
we're really sorry, but she did ask us first.:::['3-17-100']
that's okay. if you all have to go away......for the first weekend i'm:::['3-17-101']
alone by myself......then i totally understand.:::['3-17-102']
i can stay. i'm gonna stay.:::['3-17-103']
the last time i went, i was afraid to leave the chair lift.:::['3-17-104']
i just went round and round.:::['3-17-105']
we need you to drive us there in your grandmother's cab.:::['3-17-106']
but you know what? i'll stay. no, i'll stay. he's my brother.:::['3-17-107']
what, a "pity stay"? no.:::['3-17-108']
we're gonna have fun.:::['3-17-109']
we can make fudge.:::['3-17-110']
pity food?:::['3-17-111']
you know what? i don't need any of you to stay.:::['3-17-112']
nobody stays.:::['3-17-113']
well, then i might as well offer to stay.:::['3-17-114']
joey: hey...:::['3-17-115']
does anybody else feel bad about ross?:::['3-17-116']
you think he's still mad?:::['3-17-117']
he's probably more mad since you called him to borrow his goggles.:::['3-17-118']
what? mine aren't tinted.:::['3-17-119']
what does the sign say?:::['3-17-122']
"beam me up, jesus.":::['3-17-123']
the "no smoking" sign.:::['3-17-124']
there's no smoking in my grandmother's cab.:::['3-17-125']
well, then i have to go to the bathroom.:::['3-17-126']
no unscheduled stops. you can go when we stop for gas.:::['3-17-128']
there's a rest stop right up there. come on, i really have to go.:::['3-17-129']
oh, now i have to go.:::['3-17-130']
chandler: here we go.:::['3-17-131']
chandler: brace yourself. monica: what?:::['3-17-132']
monica: okay. ow.:::['3-17-133']
aren't you gonna go? no, thanks.:::['3-17-134']
rachel never pees in public restrooms.:::['3-17-135']
they never have any paper in there.:::['3-17-136']
so my rule is, "no tissue, no tushy.":::['3-17-137']
well, if everybody's going...:::['3-17-138']
don't close it. the keys are in there.:::['3-17-139']
what's going on? my lighter's in there.:::['3-17-141']
damn. the tailpipe's not hot enough to light this.:::['3-17-142']
i can open this. anybody got a coat hanger?:::['3-17-143']
oh, i do.:::['3-17-144']
no, i took it out of my shirt when i put it on this morning.:::['3-17-145']
so if your parents hadn't divorced......you'd be able to answer a question:::['3-17-146']
like a normal person?:::['3-17-147']
look, i just need a wire something to jimmy it.:::['3-17-148']
one of you give me your bra underwire.:::['3-17-149']
come on. who has the biggest boobs?:::['3-17-151']
whoever has the biggest boobs, has the biggest bra and wire.:::['3-17-152']
no. it's too expensive.:::['3-17-153']
to get back in the car, we need that wire.:::['3-17-154']
your call.:::['3-17-155']
monica's are the biggest.:::['3-17-156']
these tiny little non-breasts? please. it's gotta be rachel.:::['3-17-157']
no, mine are deceptively small.:::['3-17-158']
i mean, i actually sometimes stuff my bra.:::['3-17-159']
well, then your bra would still be big.:::['3-17-160']
no, i stuff outside the bra.:::['3-17-161']
ladies, let's just compromise, okay?:::['3-17-162']
phoebe, rachel, take off monica's bra.:::['3-17-163']
all right, forget it, never mind.:::['3-17-164']
you can have mine. monica: thank you.:::['3-17-165']
chandler. what are you doing? there's a trash can right there.:::['3-17-166']
i thought if i littered, that crying indian might come by and save us.:::['3-17-167']
thank you, phoebe. that's very, very generous.:::['3-17-169']
now, let's decide who has the nicest ass.:::['3-17-170']
and there you go.:::['3-17-171']
well, at least let me smoke it to the good part.:::['3-17-173']
what's going on? what?:::['3-17-175']
yeah, this has happened before.:::['3-17-176']
so you know how to fix it? yep. put more gas in.:::['3-17-177']
hi. what are you doing here?:::['3-17-178']
i was wondering, when you and i split up......did you get the tape that was:::['3-17-179']
half the last episode of m.a.s. h......and half the hostages coming home?:::['3-17-180']
but now it's susan and me in mexico and the hostages coming home.:::['3-17-181']
where's ben? he's sleeping. ah. ooh.:::['3-17-182']
is this a bad time?:::['3-17-183']
yeah, actually. susan's gonna be here any minute.:::['3-17-184']
it's kind of an anniversary. oh.:::['3-17-185']
i thought you guys got married in january.:::['3-17-186']
a different kind of anniversary.:::['3-17-187']
so anyway...:::['3-17-189']
candles, champagne...:::['3-17-190']
yeah, anniversaries are great......because love lasts forever,you know?:::['3-17-191']
there's nothing like it in this life. money in the bank.:::['3-17-192']
so rachel and i broke up.:::['3-17-193']
god, ross, i am so sorry.:::['3-17-194']
i wanna talk about this so much......but when we can really get into it.:::['3-17-196']
you free for dinner tomorrow? i'd love that.:::['3-17-197']
i guess it all started when rachel got this new job.:::['3-17-199']
triple a can pick us up.:::['3-17-200']
what town are we near?:::['3-17-201']
freemont. westmont.:::['3-17-202']
uh, westberg?:::['3-17-203']
why are you answering?:::['3-17-204']
do you know what route we're on?:::['3-17-205']
we are definitely on route 27.:::['3-17-206']
we are at a rest stop on route 27...:::['3-17-207']
there is no route 27.:::['3-17-208']
either 93 or 76. rachel: i don't know.:::['3-17-209']
i always slept in the back when we drove here.:::['3-17-210']
can you just send someone up and down 76 and check every rest stop?:::['3-17-211']
and also 93?:::['3-17-212']
okay. no, they don't do that.:::['3-17-213']
somebody will come and save us.:::['3-17-214']
who? have you seen a car in the last hour and a half?:::['3-17-215']
we should call ross. maybe he can get a car to get us.:::['3-17-216']
i am not getting in a car with ross.:::['3-17-217']
we will just have to......live here.:::['3-17-218']
but it's so cold. no.:::['3-17-219']
i won't get in a car with him. think of something else.:::['3-17-220']
joey and chandler are back.:::['3-17-221']
so the going-for-help went well? oh, yeah.:::['3-17-222']
smokey joe here got halfway to the highway and collapsed.:::['3-17-223']
i have the lung capacity of a 2-year-old.:::['3-17-224']
then why are you smoking?:::['3-17-225']
it's very unsettling.:::['3-17-226']
right? i mean, it's pretty unbelievable.:::['3-17-227']
they just took off without even looking back.:::['3-17-228']
i don't need them. i've got you guys now as friends.:::['3-17-229']
you and susan.:::['3-17-230']
susan will be so pleased.:::['3-17-231']
seven-one-seven?:::['3-17-232']
where's 717?:::['3-17-233']
you have more of these for susan, right?:::['3-17-234']
no, but that's okay.:::['3-17-235']
i'll just put out pickles or something.:::['3-17-236']
ross, thank god. ross: pheebs?:::['3-17-237']
why are you whispering?:::['3-17-238']
i ate a bug.:::['3-17-239']
hey, rach. the tampons here are only a penny.:::['3-17-240']
let's stock up.:::['3-17-241']
we're out of gas and don't know where we are, so we can't get a tow truck.:::['3-17-242']
oh. now you want a favor? yes, please.:::['3-17-243']
i'm sorry your car broke down, pheebs......but i'm too busy with some of:::['3-17-244']
my real friends right now.:::['3-17-245']
but please call to let me know you got home safely.:::['3-17-246']
phoebe, hang on a second.:::['3-17-247']
take my car. get your friends.:::['3-17-248']
no, i won't pick them up.:::['3-17-249']
we both know you'll do it because you're not a jerk.:::['3-17-250']
so you can sulk here for half an hour, then go get them......or save time and sulk in the car.:::['3-17-251']
rachel doesn't...:::['3-17-252']
i'm sorry rachel dumped you for mark......and you're the innocent victim:::['3-17-253']
in this.:::['3-17-254']
but don't punish your friends for what rachel did.:::['3-17-255']
phoebe, hang on. ross wants to say something.:::['3-17-257']
what? you slept with someone else?:::['3-17-258']
we were on a break.:::['3-17-259', '3-17-301']
we were... yeah.:::['3-17-260']
where are you? i'll find you.:::['3-17-261']
you slept with another woman?:::['3-17-262']
oh, you're one to talk.:::['3-17-263']
okay, done.:::['3-17-264']
what's "pleh"?:::['3-17-265']
that's "help" spelled backwards......so that the helicopters can read it:::['3-17-266']
from the air.:::['3-17-267']
ha. what's "dufus" spelled backwards?:::['3-17-268']
rachel: car. car.:::['3-17-269']
oh, it's ross on one of his drives.:::['3-17-270']
what is he doing here?:::['3-17-272']
he is saving your butt.:::['3-17-273']
unless i'm stepping on some toes here......in which case,i could just mosey on.:::['3-17-274']
i have plenty of people to help on the interstate.:::['3-17-275']
joey: come on. monica: we need your help, please.:::['3-17-276']
rachel: fine. fine.:::['3-17-277']
oh, no. now it's not gonna make any sense.:::['3-17-278']
you guys......what do we do about ross?:::['3-17-279']
he drove all the way up here.:::['3-17-280']
just send him back, then we'll go skiing?:::['3-17-281']
this is horrible. it's just horrible.:::['3-17-282']
should we ask ross to come along?:::['3-17-283']
but what about rachel? how are we gonna even ask her?:::['3-17-284']
ask me what?:::['3-17-285']
if, uh, it might be okay if ross came skiing?:::['3-17-286']
all: no, i wasn't gonna ask that.:::['3-17-287']
you guys are unbelievable. no, he cannot come.:::['3-17-288']
excuse me? chandler: it's horrible.:::['3-17-289']
oh, please? can't i come to your special, magical cabin?:::['3-17-290']
why would you even want to come? you're a horrible skier.:::['3-17-291']
oh. hitting me where it hurts. my ski skills.:::['3-17-292']
here we go again.:::['3-17-293']
i can't handle this, you guys.:::['3-17-294']
i can handle it. "handle" is my middle name.:::['3-17-295']
actually, it's the middle part of my first name.:::['3-17-296']
all right, pheebs, your cab's ready.:::['3-17-297']
i'm sorry. were you speaking to me, or sleeping with someone else?:::['3-17-300']
why don't you just put that on your answering machine?:::['3-17-302']
it's valid, and i'm not the only one who thinks so.:::['3-17-303']
monica agrees with me.:::['3-17-304']
you said it last night.:::['3-17-307']
what i said was that i understood.:::['3-17-308']
joey is the one who agreed with you.:::['3-17-309']
really, joey?:::['3-17-310']
you know what? there is no right or wrong here.:::['3-17-312']
i think it's very obvious who's wrong here.:::['3-17-313']
obviously not to joey.:::['3-17-314']
ross: joey and monica feel like i do. rachel: you and this innocent act.:::['3-17-316']
hey, guess who i am?:::['3-17-317']
hey, hey, hey, hey. hey.:::['3-17-318']
look what you're doing to chandler.:::['3-17-319']
look. we know that this is really, really hard for you guys.:::['3-17-320']
you don't have to love each other.:::['3-17-321']
you don't even have to like each other much right now.:::['3-17-322']
but please find a way to be around each other.:::['3-17-323']
and not put us in the middle.:::['3-17-324']
otherwise, i mean, that's just it for us hanging out together.:::['3-17-325']
can you be civil?:::['3-17-327']
yeah. i can.:::['3-17-328']
good, let's get back in the car. it's freezing......and my chest is unsupported.:::['3-17-329']
i mean, what are we doing? who's going with who?:::['3-17-331']
look, you guys should go.:::['3-17-332']
you know, you planned this all out......and i don't wanna ruin it.:::['3-17-333']
so just go.:::['3-17-334']
you drove all the way up here. no, no, no.:::['3-17-335']
i've gotta take the car back anyway.:::['3-17-336']
i'm spending all day tomorrow with ben.:::['3-17-337']
it's fine, okay? just go. no guilt, i promise.:::['3-17-338']
monica: we'll call you when we get back.:::['3-17-340']
maybe we can, like, go to a movie or something.:::['3-17-341']
or the rodeo.:::['3-17-342']
that would be great. okay.:::['3-17-343']
i was being shelley winters from the poseidon adventure.:::['3-17-344']
ross. hi. sorry i'm late.:::['3-17-347']
were you sleeping? uh, no.:::['3-17-348']
i had to get you a new battery. i got the best i could.:::['3-17-350']
you don't want to skimp there.:::['3-17-351']
it came to about $112.:::['3-17-353']
but what the hell, call it an even 110?:::['3-17-354']
i'll pay you tomorrow. bye.:::['3-17-355']
so they, uh, all took off.:::['3-17-356']
it was pretty hard watching them go, you know?:::['3-17-357']
yeah, okay. bye.:::['3-17-358']
ross: so i'm gonna take off then.:::['3-17-359']
so i told carl, nobody, no matter how famous their parents are......nobody is allowed:::['3-7-0']
to climb on the dinosaur.:::['3-7-1']
but of course, this went right in one ear...:::['3-7-2']
rachel: i love how he cares so much about stuff.:::['3-7-3']
if i squint, i can pretend he's alan alda.:::['3-7-4']
monica: oh, good. another dinosaur story.:::['3-7-5']
when are those gonna become extinct?:::['3-7-6']
chandler: if i was a superhero who could fly and be invisible......that would be the best.:::['3-7-7']
gunther: what does rachel see in this guy?:::['3-7-8']
i love rachel.:::['3-7-9']
i wish she was my wife.:::['3-7-10']
phoebe: who's singing?:::['3-7-11']
hey, when you guys were kids and you played happy days......who were you? i was always richie.:::['3-7-12']
i was always joanie.:::['3-7-13']
question: was, uh, "egg the gellers" the war cry of your neighborhood?:::['3-7-14']
ew, ew! it's the mattress king.:::['3-7-15']
don't look. change the channel. joey: boo!:::['3-7-16']
wait. i want to see this. after i divorce him......half of that kingdom:::['3-7-17']
is gonna be mine.:::['3-7-18']
despair fills the mattress showroom.:::['3-7-19']
my kingdom is suddenly without a queen.:::['3-7-20']
i'm so depressed......i'm going to slash......my prices! check it out!:::['3-7-21']
599 for a california king. 499 for a pillow-top queen set.:::['3-7-22']
i'm going medieval on prices.:::['3-7-23']
what a wank.:::['3-7-24']
oh, i cannot believe he's using our divorce to sell mattresses.:::['3-7-25']
i know. at 499 for a pillow-top queen, who cares about the divorce?:::['3-7-26']
those babies will sell themselves.:::['3-7-27']
and i'm appalled for you, by the way.:::['3-7-28']
i'm close. i'm cheap. i'm the king.:::['3-7-29']
okay. okay, daddy. we'll see you tomorrow night. okay, bye-bye.:::['3-7-30']
"we"? ahem.:::['3-7-31']
are, uh, having dinner with my dad tomorrow night. i hope that's okay.:::['3-7-32']
oh, shoot. tomorrow's not good.:::['3-7-33']
i'm supposed to, um, fall off the empire state building......and land on a bicycle:::['3-7-34']
with no seat, so...:::['3-7-35']
ross, my father doesn't hate you.:::['3-7-36']
please. he refers to me as "wet-head.":::['3-7-37']
honey, he calls everybody by a nickname.:::['3-7-38']
okay, look, i know. just one dinner. please, one night. for me. please?:::['3-7-39']
i just want him to love you like i do.:::['3-7-40']
all right. well, not exactly like i do.:::['3-7-41']
but if you do come to dinner......i'll love you like i do:::['3-7-42']
in that black thing that you like.:::['3-7-43']
hi, gunther.:::['3-7-46']
yeah. we'll see.:::['3-7-47']
hey, you guys. chandler: hey.:::['3-7-48']
rachel: hey. hey. guess what.:::['3-7-49']
i got a gig. great.:::['3-7-50']
see, that's why i can never be an actor. because i can't say "gig.":::['3-7-51']
yeah, i can't say "croissant." oh, my god.:::['3-7-52']
what's the part? it's not a part. no.:::['3-7-53']
i'm teaching acting for soap operas at the learning extension.:::['3-7-54']
come on. that's great.:::['3-7-55']
it's like my chance to give something back......to the acting community.:::['3-7-56']
you know, you're probably not allowed to sleep with any of your students.:::['3-7-57']
ugh. i don't know, monica. it feels funny just being here.:::['3-7-59']
i mean, if you buy a bed from janice's ex-husband......that's like betraying chandler.:::['3-7-60']
not at these prices.:::['3-7-61']
you know, in england this car would be on the other side of the store.:::['3-7-63']
phoebe, come here.:::['3-7-66']
ah, this is my new bed.:::['3-7-67']
you gotta feel this bad boy.:::['3-7-68']
ugh. monica, it still feels so weird, you know?:::['3-7-69']
chandler's your friend. oh.:::['3-7-70']
oh. all right, take this bed. you can make other friends. oh.:::['3-7-72']
good evening.:::['3-7-73']
i am mr. tribbiani.:::['3-7-74']
and i will be teaching acting for soap operas.:::['3-7-75']
now, um......on my first day as dr. drake:::['3-7-76']
ramoray on days of our lives......uh, ahem, i learned that:::['3-7-77']
one of the most important things......in soap opera acting is reacting.:::['3-7-78']
this does not mean acting again.:::['3-7-79']
it means you don't have a line, but someone else just did.:::['3-7-80']
and it goes something like this. ahem.:::['3-7-81']
thanks. thanks. thanks a lot.:::['3-7-82']
by the way, before i forget. to work in soap operas......some of you are gonna have to become:::['3-7-83']
much more attractive.:::['3-7-84']
all right, moving right along...:::['3-7-85']
oh! how was teaching last night? oh, it was great. you get to say stuff like::::['3-7-87']
"hey, the bell doesn't dismiss you. i dismiss you.":::['3-7-88']
oh, nice. yeah.:::['3-7-89']
oh, and guess what. i got an audition for all my children.:::['3-7-90']
oh, yay! yeah, it's this great part.:::['3-7-91']
this boxer named nick.:::['3-7-92']
and i'm so, so right for it, you know? he's just like me......except that he's a boxer......and has an evil twin.:::['3-7-93']
dum-datta-dum.:::['3-7-95']
hear ye, hear ye. delivery from the mattress king.:::['3-7-96']

ooh. do i have a middle name? mm-hm.:::['3-7-99']

it's that bedroom there.:::['3-7-101']
hey, monica bought a bed from the mattress king?:::['3-7-102']
yeah. so please, please, please don't say anything to chandler.:::['3-7-103']
you want me to lie to chandler? is that a problem?:::['3-7-104']
oh, hey, hey, nick the boxer. let's see what you got.:::['3-7-106']
yeah. all right, put them up. come on.:::['3-7-107']
hey, you're pretty good at this. ha, ha.:::['3-7-108']
yeah, i had to learn. i was staying at the y......and some of the young men:::['3-7-109']

hey, now. hey.:::['3-7-111']
ow. and i'm bleeding. okay, great. oh, oh!:::['3-7-112']

put your head back. ooh. okay. all right.:::['3-7-115']
i can't see. i have you.:::['3-7-116']
delivery man: which bedroom do you want it in, ms. geller?:::['3-7-118']
oh. it's the compulsively neat one by the window, okay?:::['3-7-119']
this is where they put us?:::['3-7-122']
what? there was no table available in the kitchen?:::['3-7-123']
hello, baby. you remember ross.:::['3-7-124']
mm-hm. nice to see you again, dr. green.:::['3-7-125']
so.:::['3-7-126']
how's the library? uh, museum.:::['3-7-127']
what happened to the library? there never was a library.:::['3-7-128']
i mean, there are libraries. it's just that i, um...:::['3-7-129']
i've never worked at one. ha, ha.:::['3-7-130']
you know what's really good here?:::['3-7-131']
the lobster. mm.:::['3-7-132']
what do you say? shall i just order three? yeah, if you're really hungry. ha, ha.:::['3-7-133']
it was a joke. i made a joke.:::['3-7-134']
yeah, actually, daddy, ross is allergic to lobster.:::['3-7-135']
what kind of person's allergic to lobster?:::['3-7-136']
i guess the kind of person that works in a library. ha, ha.:::['3-7-137']
it's not... i know. it's a museum.:::['3-7-138']
what, you're the only who can make a joke? at least mine was funny.:::['3-7-139']
uh, waiter.:::['3-7-140']
we will have two lobsters and a menu.:::['3-7-141']
so, dr. green, how's the old boat?:::['3-7-142']
they found rust.:::['3-7-143']
do you know what rust does to a boat? gives it a nice antique-y look?:::['3-7-144']
rust is boat cancer, ross.:::['3-7-145']
wow, i'm sorry.:::['3-7-146']
when i was a kid, i lost a bike to that. ha, ha.:::['3-7-147']
excuse me for a moment, will you, please?:::['3-7-148']
i wanna say good night to the levines before we go.:::['3-7-149']
honey, stop. it's not that bad.:::['3-7-151']
yeah. oh.:::['3-7-152']
uh-oh. i think your dad must have added wrong.:::['3-7-153']
he only tipped, like, 4 percent.:::['3-7-154']
yeah. ahem, that's daddy.:::['3-7-155']
"that's daddy"? doesn't it bother you? you're a waitress.:::['3-7-156']
yes, it bothers me, ross.:::['3-7-157']
but, you know, if he was a regular at the coffee house......i'd be serving him sneezers.:::['3-7-158']
so? so, ross......i've bugged him about this:::['3-7-159']
a million times. he's not gonna change.:::['3-7-160']
do you really serve people sneezers?:::['3-7-161']
ahem, well, um, i don't.:::['3-7-162']
all right, kids. ready? yes.:::['3-7-163']
thanks again, dr. green. uh-huh.:::['3-7-164']
wait, wait, wait, i think i forgot my receipt.:::['3-7-165']
oh, you don't need that. ahem, why not?:::['3-7-166']
the carbon. it's messy. i mean, gets on your fingers and causes......the, uh, night blindness.:::['3-7-167']
who put a 20 down here?:::['3-7-169']
huh? oh, yeah, that would be me.:::['3-7-170']
um, i have... i have a problem.:::['3-7-171']
i tip way too much, way, way too much.:::['3-7-172']
it's a sickness, really. yeah, it is. it is.:::['3-7-173']
we have to do something about that. excuse me.:::['3-7-174']
you think i'm cheap?:::['3-7-175']
he didn't mean anything by that. huh?:::['3-7-176']
he really didn't. nothing i do means anything. really.:::['3-7-177']
this is nice. i pay $200 for dinner.:::['3-7-178']
you put down 20 and you come out looking like mr. big-shot.:::['3-7-179']
you really wanna be mr. big-shot? oh.:::['3-7-180']
here. i'll tell you what. you pay the whole bill, mr. big-shot. all right?:::['3-7-181']
well, "mr. big-shot" is better than "wet-head.":::['3-7-182']
okay, some tricks of the trade.:::['3-7-183']
now, i've never been able to cry as an actor......so if i'm in a scene:::['3-7-184']
where i have to cry......i cut a hole in my pocket......take a pair of tweezers......and just start pulling.:::['3-7-185']
okay. or uh... or let's say i want to convey......that i've, uh,just done something evil.:::['3-7-186']
well, that would be your basic i've-got-a fish-hook-in-my-eyebrow-and-i-like-it.:::['3-7-187']
no? okay. let's say i've just gotten bad news.:::['3-7-188']
well, all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13.:::['3-7-189']
great soap opera acting tonight, everybody.:::['3-7-191']
class dismissed.:::['3-7-192']
hey, mr. trib. hey.:::['3-7-193']
guess what. i got an audition.:::['3-7-194']
oh. one of my students got an audition. i'm so proud.:::['3-7-195']
i was wondering if you would consider coaching me for it.:::['3-7-196']
oh, you bet. what's the part? oh, it's great.:::['3-7-197']
it's a role on all my children. nick the boxer.:::['3-7-198']
had to do it, didn't you? you couldn't leave it alone.:::['3-7-199']
four percent, okay? i tip more than that when there's a bug in my food.:::['3-7-200']
ross, tonight was about the two of you getting along.:::['3-7-201']
both: ugh.:::['3-7-202']
would you see my chiropractor already?:::['3-7-203']
yeah, i'm gonna go to a doctor who went to medical school in a mini-mall.:::['3-7-204']
hey, pheebs. what are you doing?:::['3-7-205']
i'm... i'm freaking out.:::['3-7-206']
monica kind of trusted me with something and she shouldn't have.:::['3-7-207']
all right, i haven't lived here in a while, so i have to ask you.:::['3-7-208']
does monica still turn the lights on in her bedroom?:::['3-7-209']
ahem. yeah. i am so dead.:::['3-7-210']
all right, look, here's the bottom line, ross.:::['3-7-211']
this is fixable if we act fast, okay?:::['3-7-212']
so i'll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice.:::['3-7-213']
honey, i have tried to make nice. it doesn't work.:::['3-7-214']
okay. look, i realize my father is difficult......but that's why you have got to be:::['3-7-215']
the bigger man here.:::['3-7-216']
look, sweetie, i could be the bigger man. i could be the biggest man.:::['3-7-217']
i could be a big, huge, giant man and it still wouldn't make a difference.:::['3-7-218']
except that i could pick your father up and say, "like me. like me, tiny doctor.":::['3-7-219']
okay, well, can't you just try it one more time, ross? for me? for me?:::['3-7-220']
rachel, one brunch is not gonna solve anything.:::['3-7-221']
you've gotta face it. we're never gonna get along.:::['3-7-222']
okay, well, you are just going to have to.:::['3-7-223']
okay? i've already got a mother and father who cannot stay in the same room.:::['3-7-224']
i don't want to have a separate room for you too.:::['3-7-225']
okay, okay. okay.:::['3-7-226']
i'll get the bagels.:::['3-7-227']
isn't it cool? vroom. vroom.:::['3-7-229']
this is not the bed i ordered.:::['3-7-230']
i know. you must have won, like, a contest or something.:::['3-7-231']
why is this car in my bedroom?:::['3-7-233']
i'm sorry, okay. i wasn't looking......and the store said that they won't:::['3-7-234']
take it back because you signed for it.:::['3-7-235']
when did i sign for it? when i was you.:::['3-7-236']
you know what? it's all joey's fault because he left his nose open.:::['3-7-237']

her legs are fine. i know that.:::['3-7-296']
so why do you let her go to a chiropractor? i'm sorry, "let her"?:::['3-7-297']

yeah, honey. i was standing right there.:::['3-7-305']
why don't you tell him about the mole i haven't gotten checked?:::['3-7-306']
there will come a time in each of your careers......when you'll have a chance to screw over:::['3-7-308']
another soap opera actor.:::['3-7-309']
i had such an opportunity in the recent present.:::['3-7-310']
and i'm ashamed to say......that i took it.:::['3-7-311']
i advised a fellow actor to play a role......homosexually.:::['3-7-312']
we both auditioned for the part and, uh......as it turned out......they...:::['3-7-314']
they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him.:::['3-7-315']
and now......he's got a two-year contract......opposite susan lucci......the first lady of daytime television.:::['3-7-316']
and me?:::['3-7-317']
me, i'm stuck here teaching a bunch of people...:::['3-7-318']
to even be on tv.:::['3-7-319']
uh, may i help you? yes, hi.:::['3-7-322']
i'm the lady who got stuck with the race-car bed.:::['3-7-323']
look, it's like i told you. there's nothing i can do.:::['3-7-324']
you signed for it. "monica felula geller.":::['3-7-325']

hey, you can't go back there.:::['3-7-329']
hey, watch it, lady.:::['3-7-331']
hey, good-looking.:::['3-7-332']

my bed's so boring.:::['3-7-334']
janice has a question. who of the six of you......has slept with:::['3-6-0']
who of the six of you?:::['3-6-1']
wow, it's like a dirty math problem.:::['3-6-2']
i'm sorry, the answer there would be none of us.:::['3-6-3']
over the years, none of you ever got drunk and stupid?:::['3-6-4']
well, that's really a different question.:::['3-6-5']
i can't believe a group of people who spends this much time together......has never bumped uglies.:::['3-6-6']
there was that one time monica and rachel got together.:::['3-6-7']
excuse me, there was no time.:::['3-6-9']
okay, but let's say there was.:::['3-6-10']
how might that go?:::['3-6-11']
well, then answer me this::::['3-6-13']
have any of you ever almost?:::['3-6-14']
anybody need more coffee? hey, there's a dog out there!:::['3-6-15']
ugh. that is so unfortunate. what?:::['3-6-16']
cute naked guy's starting to put on weight.:::['3-6-17']
i'll be back in just a minute.:::['3-6-18']
i'm sorry that i left lipstick marks on the phone.:::['3-6-19']
you didn't leave lipstick marks on the phone.:::['3-6-20']
oh! then it must have been you. bye.:::['3-6-21']
that's why i moved out. ross: hey, while we're on that......when are you gonna tell my sister:::['3-6-23']
you don't live here anymore?:::['3-6-24']
on some level, she already knows.:::['3-6-25']
she doesn't know you sneak out every night......and back every morning......and that you've been:::['3-6-26']
at your grandmother's for a week.:::['3-6-27']
okay, well, maybe not on those levels.:::['3-6-28']
i'm never gonna find a roommate. ever.:::['3-6-30']
nobody good?:::['3-6-31']
there was the guy with the ferrets.:::['3-6-32']
that's plural.:::['3-6-33']
the spitter. oh! and the guy who enjoyed my name so much......he made a noise:::['3-6-34']
every time he said it.:::['3-6-35']
"nice to meet you, chandler bing. bing!":::['3-6-36']
"great apartment, chandler bing. bing!":::['3-6-37']
how many more tomorrow? two.:::['3-6-38']
this photographer who seemed really dull......and this actor guy:::['3-6-39']
who i'm not sure about.:::['3-6-40']
when i answered the phone, "chandler bing"......he said, "whoa! short message!":::['3-6-41']
monica: ross...:::['3-6-42']
foot on the floor or come over no more.:::['3-6-43']
your dresser is missing, but this she notices.:::['3-6-44']
what? i have to go. heh.:::['3-6-45']
carol should be home by now, so...:::['3-6-46']
how's it going with you guys? better, actually.:::['3-6-47']
i finally figured out why we're having so much trouble.:::['3-6-48']
oh, really? yeah. you know how i have you guys?:::['3-6-49']
she doesn't have any close friends that are just hers.:::['3-6-50']
but last week, she met this woman at the gym, susan something.:::['3-6-51']
and they really hit it off, and i think it's gonna make a difference.:::['3-6-52']
so, uh, eric......what kind of photography do you do?:::['3-6-53']
oh, mostly fashion.:::['3-6-54']
there may be models here sometimes. i hope that's cool.:::['3-6-55']
yes, that is cool.:::['3-6-56']
uh, because i have models here, you know......never.:::['3-6-57']
ooh! during the summer, i spend most weekends at my sister's beach house......which you're welcome to use.:::['3-6-58']
although i should tell you, she's a porn star.:::['3-6-59']
well, i still have one more person to meet.:::['3-6-60']
but unless it turns out to be your sister......ahem, i think your chances:::['3-6-61']
are pretty good.:::['3-6-62']
bedroom, bathroom, living room.:::['3-6-64']
this here is the kitchen, and thanks for coming by. bye-bye.:::['3-6-65']

i'm fairly neat.:::['3-6-70']
i got my own tv.:::['3-6-71']
oh, and don't worry, i'm totally okay with the gay thing.:::['3-6-72']
ha, ha. what gay thing?:::['3-6-73']
uh, just, you know, in general. the whole people-being-gay thing.:::['3-6-74']

table's free. rack them up. back in a minute.:::['3-6-91']
get ready for me to whip your butt.:::['3-6-92']

oh, ahem, no, no, no. excuse me? hello? hi.:::['3-6-94']
my friend ordered an onion......not an olive.:::['3-6-95']
and i ordered a rum and diet coke......which i don't think this is.:::['3-6-96']
i am so sorry. rachel: that's all right.:::['3-6-97']
how hard is it to get a couple drinks right, huh?:::['3-6-98']
i would like to propose a toast......to the woman who, in one year:::['3-6-100']
from today, will become......mrs. dr. barry farber, d.d.s.:::['3-6-101']
i think it's time to see the ring again.:::['3-6-102']
ugh! isn't it exciting? i mean, it's like having a boyfriend for life! heh!:::['3-6-103']
ahem. yeah, i know.:::['3-6-104']
well, maybe it's just the idea......of barry for the rest of my life.:::['3-6-107']
i don't know, i think i...:::['3-6-108']
i feel like having one last fling......just to sort of get it:::['3-6-109']
out of my system.:::['3-6-110']
rachel, stop! you're so bad! ha!:::['3-6-111']
i'm serious. i really think i need to just have......some meaningless sex,you know?:::['3-6-112']
with the next guy i see.:::['3-6-113']
excuse me, i seem to have dropped my ball.:::['3-6-114']
and now i've picked it up again.:::['3-6-116']

just taking it to get rewired.:::['3-6-144']
don't take it where you took the stereo. they've had that over a week.:::['3-6-145']
no, no. mr. heckles, no one is making any noise up here.:::['3-6-146']
you're disturbing my oboe practice.:::['3-6-147']
you don't play the oboe. i could play the oboe.:::['3-6-148']
then i'm gonna have to ask you to keep it down.:::['3-6-149']
i'm eric, chandler's new roommate. i'm chandler's new roommate.:::['3-6-151']
i don't think so. i could be chandler's new roommate.:::['3-6-152']
but he told me over the phone... he told me in person.:::['3-6-153']
i'm going to, uh, go into my new apartment now.:::['3-6-155']

you okay? yeah. phew!:::['3-6-164']
i stood up too fast. got a little head rush.:::['3-6-165']
it's the heat.:::['3-6-166']
and the humidity.:::['3-6-167']
that's......a tough combination.:::['3-6-168']
do you want to come in for some lemonade?:::['3-6-169']
like you wouldn't believe.:::['3-6-170']
wow. this is a great place.:::['3-6-171']
just make yourself comfortable.:::['3-6-173']
so this place is really my grandmother's.:::['3-6-175']
i got it when she moved to florida. otherwise i could never afford it.:::['3-6-176']
so if the landlord ever asks......i'm an 87-year-old woman who's:::['3-6-177']
afraid of her vcr. you thirsty?:::['3-6-178']
you bet i am!:::['3-6-179']

ah! were you just gonna give me lemonade? yuh-huh!:::['3-6-184']
cover yourself up!:::['3-6-185']
oh, right. sorry.:::['3-6-186']
god, i don't believe this!:::['3-6-187']
someone asks you in for lemonade and that means they want to have sex?:::['3-6-188']
usually, yeah. well, not just lemonade......iced tea, sometimes juice.:::['3-6-189']
look, sorry. i just...:::['3-6-190']
i thought you liked me.:::['3-6-191']
i'm such a jerk.:::['3-6-192']
i suppose it could happen to anyone.:::['3-6-194']
not anyone i know, but...:::['3-6-195']
by the way, i can still see it.:::['3-6-196']
pheebs? huh?:::['3-6-197']
where's your bed?:::['3-6-198']
it's not in the apartment?:::['3-6-199']
i can't believe this is happening again.:::['3-6-201']
what? okay, enough with the third degree!:::['3-6-202']
i don't live here anymore.:::['3-6-203', '3-6-205']
what are you talking about? i'm sorry.:::['3-6-204']
i didn't know how to tell you. but, you know, everybody else knows.:::['3-6-206']
everybody knows?:::['3-6-207']
that was supposed to be a good thing. i forget why.:::['3-6-208']
monica, do you know i couldn't sleep for a month......because i got a dot of ink:::['3-6-209']
on one of the sofa cushions?:::['3-6-210']
you could've just turned the cushion over.:::['3-6-211']
i would have, but i had a spaghetti stain on the other side.:::['3-6-212']
this is what i'm talking about.:::['3-6-214']
i need to live in a land where people can spill!:::['3-6-215']
well, you can spill.:::['3-6-216']
in the sink.:::['3-6-217']
oh, honey. it's not your fault, you know. this is who you are.:::['3-6-218']
and i love you. and i want us to be friends.:::['3-6-219']
and if i stay here, i don't see that happening.:::['3-6-220']
i love you too. good.:::['3-6-221']
what? i'm just sad.:::['3-6-223']
no, you're not. you're wondering which cushion it is.:::['3-6-224']
so what are you watching?:::['3-6-225']
baywatch.:::['3-6-226']
what's it about?:::['3-6-227']
lifeguards.:::['3-6-228']
well, it sounds kind of stup...:::['3-6-229']
who's she?:::['3-6-230']
joey: nicole eggert.:::['3-6-231']
we like her.:::['3-6-232']

chandler: hello? hey.:::['3-6-237']

help yourself.:::['3-6-239']
phoebe moved out.:::['3-6-241']
am i so hard to live with? is this why i don't have a boyfriend?:::['3-6-244']
you don't have a boyfriend because...:::['3-6-246']
i don't know why you don't have a boyfriend.:::['3-6-247']
you should have a boyfriend.:::['3-6-248']
listen, you are one of my favorite people......and the most beautiful woman:::['3-6-251']
i've ever known in real life.:::['3-6-252']
where is everybody?:::['3-6-254']
ugh, it's already closed. chris gave me the keys to lock up. what is wrong?:::['3-6-255']
i think my marriage......is kind of over.:::['3-6-256']
oh, no! why?:::['3-6-257']
because carol's a lesbian.:::['3-6-258']
and i'm not one.:::['3-6-259']
and apparently it's not a mix-and-match situation.:::['3-6-260']
oh, you poor bunny.:::['3-6-263']
i'm an idiot.:::['3-6-264']
i mean, i should have seen it.:::['3-6-265']
i mean, carol and i would be out, and she'd see some beautiful woman......and she'd be, "ross! look at her!":::['3-6-266']
and i'd think::::['3-6-267']
"god, my wife is cool." heh.:::['3-6-268']
aw. hey, do you think that susan person is her lover?:::['3-6-269']
well, now i do!:::['3-6-270']
seven years!:::['3-6-272']
i mean, we've been together seven years.:::['3-6-273']
she's the only woman who's ever loved me.:::['3-6-274']
she's the only woman i've ever...:::['3-6-275']
mm. this is nice.:::['3-6-277']
i know. it is, isn't it?:::['3-6-278']
no, i mean it. this feels really good.:::['3-6-279']
is it 100 percent cotton?:::['3-6-280']
yeah......and i got it on sale too.:::['3-6-281']
i should go.:::['3-6-282']
one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device.:::['3-6-283']
if you want to get a drink later, we can.:::['3-6-284']
that sounds great.:::['3-6-285']
oh, and listen, it's gonna be...:::['3-6-286']
maybe this wouldn't have happened if i'd been more nurturing......or i'd paid more attention......or i had a uterus.:::['3-6-289']
i can't believe it. i know.:::['3-6-290']
you know, you don't deserve this. you don't, ross.:::['3-6-291']
you're so good. thanks.:::['3-6-292']
and you're so sweet.:::['3-6-293']
thanks. and you're kind.:::['3-6-294']
ross: wait, wait, wait.:::['3-6-297']
phoebe: it's okay.:::['3-6-298']
wait, wait, wait! my foot is stuck in the pocket.:::['3-6-299']
what? i can't get it out.:::['3-6-300']
that's not something a girl wants to hear.:::['3-6-301']
come on, don't start.:::['3-6-302']
ow! what?:::['3-6-303']
stupid balls are in the way.:::['3-6-304']
that probably wouldn't have been the most constructive solution.:::['3-6-306']
you have chalk on your face.:::['3-6-307']
ugh. you're right. i don't know why i always thought this was real grass.:::['3-6-308']
my wife's a lesbian.:::['3-6-310']
ross, joey. joey, ross.:::['3-6-312']
i can't believe you came back.:::['3-6-313']
don't say anything.:::['3-6-314']
i don't wanna speak. i don't wanna think.:::['3-6-315']
i just want you to take me and kiss me and make love to me right here......right now.:::['3-6-316']
"time of the season" playing]:::['3-6-317']

kikl: rachel!:::['3-6-320']
what? you missed the exit.:::['3-6-322']
oh! sorry.:::['3-6-323']

barry.:::['3-6-326']
narrator: previously on friends: i don't feel like i have a girlfriend.:::['3-16-0']

fine. you're right. let's, uh, take a break.:::['3-16-6']
let's get some frozen yogurt. rachel: no.:::['3-16-7']
then we had this big fight, and i said i wanted to take a break.:::['3-16-9']

how was the big anniversary dinner?:::['3-16-20']
well, we never actually got to dinner.:::['3-16-21']
ha, ha, oh. nice.:::['3-16-22']
we kind of broke up instead.:::['3-16-23']
what? aah!:::['3-16-24']
my god! it's on the ceiling!:::['3-16-25']
this is more important than fruit......on my ceiling.:::['3-16-27']
you broke up?:::['3-16-28']
yeah, but it's okay because when ross left, mark came over.:::['3-16-29']
oh, no! you and mark? no, it's okay. calm down.:::['3-16-30']
mark and i talked......and i realized how much:::['3-16-31']
i love your stupid brother.:::['3-16-32']
we got our problems, but i really wanna make it work.:::['3-16-33']
morning!:::['3-16-34']
hi, it's me.:::['3-16-35']
i've been trying to reach you all night. i feel awful.:::['3-16-36']
please, ross, you've got to know, there's nothing between me and mark.:::['3-16-37']
this whole breakup thing is just stupid.:::['3-16-38']
ugh, i'm sorry i put you through it.:::['3-16-39']
and i don't want to get back together over a machine.:::['3-16-40']
so i love you.:::['3-16-42']
and you know what? i'm gonna go to bed now......but on my way to work tomorrow,i'll stop by around 8:30. bye.:::['3-16-44']
chloe, how's it coming?:::['3-16-45']
what kind of puppy do you think i should get?:::['3-16-46']
um, oh, hey. i don't know. how about a big one?:::['3-16-47']
but my apartment's so... then a small one.:::['3-16-48']
we have to go. wait! where's my shoes?:::['3-16-49']
you need shoes?:::['3-16-50']
do i know why we're rushing? you know my girlfriend?:::['3-16-51']
it turns out that she, uh, wants to get back together.:::['3-16-52']
i found it!:::['3-16-53']
that's so great for you guys! you must be so happy!:::['3-16-54']
yes, i am. one of the many things i'm feeling.:::['3-16-55']
good luck with your girlfriend. oh, thank you. ah, eh.:::['3-16-56']
you got my message? you are right on time!:::['3-16-58']
so can i be your girlfriend again?:::['3-16-59']
yes, you can. very much.:::['3-16-60']
ah, ah.:::['3-16-61']
why are you mopping your ceiling? ugh, there's banana on it.:::['3-16-63']
i have the spirit of an old indian woman living in mine.:::['3-16-64']
so then you know.:::['3-16-65']
the mailman was here, so i brought your mail.:::['3-16-66']
oh, good. thanks. now, what is fabutech?:::['3-16-67']
okay. don't judge me too much, okay?:::['3-16-68']
i saw this infomercial, and, um, i swear i have never......bought anything on tv before.:::['3-16-69']
except for this mop.:::['3-16-70']
but there was this stuff on leg-waxing, it looked amazing.:::['3-16-71']
waxine! yes! have you seen it?:::['3-16-72']
it's incredible! i want to be a waxine girl!:::['3-16-73']
god! do you think it really doesn't hurt? how can they do that?:::['3-16-75']
hello! organic substances recently discovered in the rain forest?:::['3-16-76']
they have the best stuff in there.:::['3-16-77']
we figured when we couldn't find you, you'd gone to make up with rachel.:::['3-16-79']
which is probably what you should have done, huh? heh.:::['3-16-80']
god, i'm in hell. i mean, what am i gonna do?:::['3-16-82']
rachel's all "i love you," and all i can think about......is what is she gonna do:::['3-16-83']
when i tell her what i did?:::['3-16-84']
first, we should address the more important question......how dumb are you?:::['3-16-85']
what? look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right?:::['3-16-86']
how am i supposed to do that without being honest?:::['3-16-87']
i'm on board about the total-honesty thing. i am.:::['3-16-88']
just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.:::['3-16-89']
he's right. nobody benefits, and you'll just hurt her.:::['3-16-90']
and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.:::['3-16-91']
don't you think...?:::['3-16-92']
if you have to tell her, at least wait till the timing's right.:::['3-16-93']
and that's what deathbeds are for.:::['3-16-94']
okay. now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way.:::['3-16-96']
did you think about the trail?:::['3-16-97']
what trail?:::['3-16-98']
from the woman you did it with......to the woman you hope:::['3-16-99']
never finds out you did it!:::['3-16-100']
always think about the trail!:::['3-16-101']
i don't think there's any trail.:::['3-16-102']
chloe works with that guy, isaac.:::['3-16-104']
isaac's sister is jasmine, who works at the massage place with phoebe.:::['3-16-105']
phoebe is rachel's friend, and that's the trail! i did it!:::['3-16-106']
phoebe: "after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg...":::['3-16-107']
did that! okay.:::['3-16-108']
"grasp the linen strip by its tab......and pull it off in one quick......pain-free motion.":::['3-16-109']
was it not "pain-free"?:::['3-16-112']
no, it was pain-ful!:::['3-16-113']
my god, they should call it "pain-zine, now with a little wax.":::['3-16-114']
the girls on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.:::['3-16-115']
because their nerves are deadened from being so stupid.:::['3-16-116']
but, you know, if you don't believe me, please be my guest.:::['3-16-117']
ow, ow, ow! oh, my god!:::['3-16-118']
now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?:::['3-16-119']
chloe, hi.:::['3-16-120']
is this about me taking your watch?:::['3-16-121']
you took my watch? i'm sorry. i do that.:::['3-16-122']
you keep it. listen, did you tell anyone about us?:::['3-16-123']
oh, no. i feel like it really isn't anybody's business.:::['3-16-124']
exactly. so you didn't mention anything to isaac?:::['3-16-125']
oh, i tell isaac everything. you do? of course you do.:::['3-16-126']
hi, isaac. you know, we haven't actually met.:::['3-16-127']
you dog!:::['3-16-128']
yes, i suppose i am a dog. but see, i happen to have a girlfriend.:::['3-16-129']
right. rachel from the coffee place.:::['3-16-130']
that's the one. listen, i don't want to hurt her.:::['3-16-131']
oh, hey, man, i know. it doesn't matter how much we love them.:::['3-16-132']
monogamy is too cruel a rule.:::['3-16-133']
yeah. listen, can you keep this information to yourself?:::['3-16-134']
oh, no problem. we gotta look out for each other.:::['3-16-135']
we're the same, you and me.:::['3-16-136']
actually, no, we're not. heh.:::['3-16-137']
no, we're not.:::['3-16-139', '3-16-141']
okay, we're not. right.:::['3-16-142']
but we are.:::['3-16-143']
fine. i just need to know that you're not gonna tell your sister.:::['3-16-144']
i can promise not to tell her again.:::['3-16-145']
jasmine? uh-huh.:::['3-16-146']
we met at phoebe's birthday party. i'm ross geller.:::['3-16-147']
you did a bad thing!:::['3-16-148']
yes, i did. very bad!:::['3-16-149']
very bad. very, very bad!:::['3-16-150']
i'm agreeing with you.:::['3-16-151']
listen, did you happen to tell phoebe yet?:::['3-16-152']
no. okay. jasmine.:::['3-16-153']
please. please don't.:::['3-16-154']
i love my girlfriend very much and i want to work it out with her.:::['3-16-155']
but you should talk to my roommate. i told him, and he knows phoebe too.:::['3-16-158']
who's your roommate?:::['3-16-159']
ross: gunther! gunther!:::['3-16-160']
tell me you didn't tell rachel about me and the girl from the copy place.:::['3-16-161']
was i not supposed to?:::['3-16-163']
ow! ow! ow! ow!:::['3-16-164']
phoebe: we're all right. it's okay. it's okay.:::['3-16-166']
ooh! we were just waxing our legs. off?:::['3-16-167']
for your information, this is a pain like no man will ever experience.:::['3-16-168']
you can't make that statement unless you've been kicked in an area......that god only meant:::['3-16-169']
to be treated nicely.:::['3-16-170']
women just have a lower threshold for pain than men, that's all.:::['3-16-171']
i mean, come on, it's just a little wax. heh.:::['3-16-172']
oh, yeah? come here.:::['3-16-173']
oh, that's mature.:::['3-16-174']
so now i just pull it off? uh-huh.:::['3-16-175']
rachel, come on. just talk to me. please!:::['3-16-177']
rachel: i can't look at you right now. what?:::['3-16-178']
she said it was okay. what are they talking about?:::['3-16-180']
just get away from me! i made a mistake, okay?:::['3-16-181']
a mistake? what were you trying to put it in? her purse?:::['3-16-182']
whe...? where did he put it?:::['3-16-183']
you had sex with another woman!:::['3-16-184']
oh, my god! oh...:::['3-16-185']
i knew something was wrong because my nails didn't grow at all yesterday.:::['3-16-186']
i guess they had a fight, and he got drunk...:::['3-16-187']
you guys knew about this and didn't tell us?:::['3-16-188']
he has sex, and we get hit in our heads!:::['3-16-189']
i want you to leave! get out! now! no! no!:::['3-16-190']
i want to stay and talk about this.:::['3-16-191']
okay! all right. how was she?:::['3-16-192']
you said you wanted to talk about it. let's talk. how was she?:::['3-16-196']
she was... awful.:::['3-16-197']
she was not good. horrible. nothing compared to you.:::['3-16-198']
she... she was different.:::['3-16-199']
joey: ooh. chandler: uh-oh.:::['3-16-200']
just stop! what? okay! okay! okay!:::['3-16-203']
should we do something?:::['3-16-204']
yeah. never cheat on rachel.:::['3-16-205']
i'm sorry, okay? i'm sorry. i was disgusted with myself......and this morning i was upset......and then i got your message,and i was so happy.:::['3-16-206']
and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment...:::['3-16-207']
whoa! whoa! whoa! wait a minute.:::['3-16-208']
what time did your little friend leave?:::['3-16-209']
oh, my god. she was there? she was still there?:::['3-16-211']
she was in there when i was in there?:::['3-16-212']
listen, the important thing is, she meant nothing to me.:::['3-16-213']
and yet she was worth jeopardizing our relationship!:::['3-16-214']
i didn't think there was a relationship.:::['3-16-215']
we'd broken up. we were on a break.:::['3-16-216']
that, for all i knew, could last forever. that is a breakup.:::['3-16-217']
you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?:::['3-16-218']
i'm not trying to "get out" of anything.:::['3-16-219']
i thought our relationship was dead.:::['3-16-220']
well, you sure had a hell of a time at the wake.:::['3-16-221']
i don't think we should listen to this anymore.:::['3-16-222']
what are you doing? we can't go out.:::['3-16-223']
why not? i'm hungry.:::['3-16-224']
because they'll know we've been listening.:::['3-16-225']
god! and to have to hear about it from gunther!:::['3-16-226']
come on, i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn't happen!:::['3-16-227']
i think i'm falling in love with you all over again.:::['3-16-229']
we can go out. they have other things to worry about.:::['3-16-230']
we'll be fine.:::['3-16-231']
rachel, i wanted to tell you. i thought i should.:::['3-16-232']
and then chandler and joey convinced me not to!:::['3-16-233']
wax the door shut. we're never leaving.:::['3-16-234']
it's phoebe. someone has to take my 9:00 with mr. rehak......because it's 9: 15 now,and i'm not there.:::['3-16-235']
none of this would've happened if i didn't think......you were having sex with mark.:::['3-16-236']
let's say i had slept with mark. would you have been able to forgive me?:::['3-16-238']
yes, i would.:::['3-16-239']
you'd be okay if mark had kissed me and been naked with me......and made love to me?:::['3-16-240']
if you knew that our hot, sweaty, writhing bodies were...:::['3-16-242']
la, la, la, la, la, la!:::['3-16-243']
okay. okay, yeah. i would have been devastated......but i would still want:::['3-16-244']
to be with you.:::['3-16-245']
because, i mean, it's you.:::['3-16-246']
come on, tell me what you're thinking.:::['3-16-249']
i'm thinking......i'm gonna order a pizza.:::['3-16-250']
order a pizza, like......"i forgive you"?:::['3-16-251']
i like pizza.:::['3-16-254']
put olives on the pizza.:::['3-16-255']
we could eat the wax! it's organic!:::['3-16-256']
oh, great. food with hair on it.:::['3-16-257']
no, not the used wax.:::['3-16-258']
because that would be crazy?:::['3-16-259']
could i get in on that? because i'm kind of hungry myself.:::['3-16-260']
yes, i'd like to order a large pizza.:::['3-16-262']
no anchovies. with, uh, extra anchovies.:::['3-16-263']
that's okay. i'll pick them off.:::['3-16-264']
and could you chop some up and put it right in the sauce?:::['3-16-265']
you can have the last piece if you want.:::['3-16-266']
well, i should think so. you slept with someone.:::['3-16-267']
they're gonna get through this, aren't they?:::['3-16-268']
yeah. come on, it's ross and rachel.:::['3-16-269']
they've got to.:::['3-16-270']
what if they don't?:::['3-16-271']
you think i need a new walk?:::['3-16-272']
well, i've been walking the same way since high school.:::['3-16-274']
you know how some guys walk into a room and everybody takes notice?:::['3-16-275']
i think i need a take-notice walk.:::['3-16-276']
are you actually saying these words?:::['3-16-277']
what, now you're not even talking to me?:::['3-16-278']
look, rachel, i'm sorry. i'm sorry. i was out of my mind.:::['3-16-279']
i thought i'd lost you.:::['3-16-280']
how insane must i have been to do something like this?:::['3-16-281']
i don't cheat, right? that's not me. i'm not joey!:::['3-16-282']
it's 3 a.m. they don't know that i've come home yet.:::['3-16-286']
you notice how they aren't wondering where i am?:::['3-16-287']
you know, people can be so self-involved.:::['3-16-288']
you know what? i'm not the one that wanted that break.:::['3-16-289']
you're the one that bailed. you're the one......that ran the moment things:::['3-16-290']
got rough.:::['3-16-291']
that's... that's what?:::['3-16-292']
that is neither here nor there. here we are......in a spot again. what do you want?:::['3-16-293']
how do you want to handle it? you want to fight for us or bail?:::['3-16-294']
i did a terrible, stupid, stupid thing, okay?:::['3-16-296']
i'm sorry. i wish i could take it back, but i can't.:::['3-16-297']
i just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.:::['3-16-298']
no, ross! don't!:::['3-16-300']
you can't just kiss me and make it all go away.:::['3-16-301']
it doesn't work that way. it doesn't just make it better.:::['3-16-302']
okay? okay, okay.:::['3-16-303']
i really think you need to go now.:::['3-16-306']
this morning you said there was nothing we couldn't work past it.:::['3-16-308']
what the hell did i know?:::['3-16-309']
there's got to be a way we can work past this. okay?:::['3-16-310']
i can't imagine my life without you.:::['3-16-311']
you know? without...:::['3-16-312']
without these arms......and your face and heart......your good heart, rach, and...:::['3-16-313']
i can't. you're a totally different person to me now.:::['3-16-315']
i used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me.:::['3-16-316']
ever.:::['3-16-317']
now i can't stop picturing you with her.:::['3-16-318']
i can't. it doesn't matter what you say or what you do.:::['3-16-319']
it's just changed everything.:::['3-16-320']
this can't be it.:::['3-16-322']
then how come it is?:::['3-16-323']
they've been quiet for a long time.:::['3-16-324']
maybe she killed him.:::['3-16-325']
is that your new walk?:::['3-16-327']
no. i really have to pee.:::['3-16-328']
